15|"""Google's parent company faces UK investigation over controversial collaboration with AI firm Anthropic."""|"Google parent's partnership with AI startup Anthropic under UK scrutiny   Business FILE PHOTO: Anthropic logo is seen in this illustration taken March 31, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo :Britain's antitrust watchdog is scrutinising Google-parent Alphabet's partnership with artificial intelligence startup Anthropic and its impact on competition, the regulator said on Tuesday. More than 18 months after Microsoft-backed OpenAI triggered an AI boom with the release of ChatGPT, antitrust regulators around the world have been increasingly concerned by multiple deals struck between smaller industry startups and big tech giants. Agreements under scrutiny include Microsoft's partnerships with startups such as OpenAI, Inflection AI, and Mistral AI, as well as Alphabet's ties to other smaller companies such as Anthropic and Cohere. Anthropic's Claude AI models have vied for prominence with OpenAI's GPT series. Last week, Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued a joint statement alongside its counterparts in the United States and the European Union, promising to work together to safeguard fair competition in the AI industry. Anthropic, which was co-founded by former OpenAI executives and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, last year said it had secured $500 million in investment from Alphabet, promising another $1.5 billion over time. Anthropic also uses Alphabet's Google Cloud services as part of its operations. On Tuesday, the CMA said it was now seeking views on whether the Alphabet-Anthropic partnership could lessen competition in the UK, and has set a deadline of Aug. 13 for its invitation to comment. A spokesperson for Anthropic said the company would cooperate with the CMA and provide the ""complete picture"" about its partnership with Google. ""We are an independent company and none of our strategic partnerships or investor relationships diminish the independence of our corporate governance or our freedom to partner with others,"" they said. The CMA will decide whether to launch an official investigation at the end of this process. A Google spokesperson said: ""Google is committed to building the most open and innovative AI ecosystem in the world. Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and does, and we don't demand exclusive tech rights.""      Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

Other markets in Asia also appeared to settle somewhat after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo closed up 10.3% – up 3,217 to 34,675, a record daily points rise – as investors bought into bargains after the 12.4% rout the day before. South Korea’s Kospi index was up 3%, while Australia’s ASX200 added 0.4% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was steady in morning trading. Markets on Monday started with a plunge reminiscent of 1987’s Black Monday crash that swept around the world and pummelled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing US economy. Wall Street suffered its worst day in almost two years, while European markets also fell, with Britain’s FTSE 100 suffering its steepest one-day decline in more than a year. The drops on Monday were the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to the global sell-off, which began on Friday, after a US report showed employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the US economy to come in weaker than expected, raising fears the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation. Professional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world. Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone, said after “the breathtaking and historic moves seen across Asian markets” on Monday “we look for a solid counter rally on open today.” Federal Reserve officials did their best to reassure markets with Fed San Francisco president Mary Daly saying it was “extremely important” to prevent the labour market tipping into a downturn. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning  Daly added that her mind was open to cutting interest rates as necessary and policy needed to be proactive. The comments underpinned market expectations that the Fed would cut by 50 basis points at its September meeting, with futures implying an 87% chance of such an outsized move.
