The leopard spot–like features speckling the clay-colored part of the rock resemble structures in Earth rocks that are associated with life. MSSS/JPL-CALTECH/NASA By Lisa Grossman JULY 25, 2024 AT 7:52 PM NASA’s Perseverance rover has bagged its first hint of ancient microbes on Mars. “We’re not able to say that this is a sign of life,” says Perseverance deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif.  “But this is the most compelling sample we’ve found yet.” The rover drilled up the sample on July 21 from a reddish rock, dubbed Cheyava Falls after a feature at the Grand Canyon. It is the first piece of Mars that Perseverance has examined that contains organic molecules, the building blocks of life, project scientist Ken Farley of Caltech reported July 25 at the 10th International Conference on Mars in Pasadena. Science News is collecting reader questions about how to navigate our planet's changing climate. What do you want to know about extreme heat and how it can lead to extreme weather events? This isn’t the first sign of organics on Mars — the Curiosity rover detected organic molecules in a region called Gale Crater in 2014 (SN: 12/16/14). But scientists have struggled to identify organics since Perseverance landed in an ancient dried-up lake called Jezero Crater in 2021, says Stack Morgan (SN: 2/17/21). Adding to the excitement, the reddish rock is speckled with little white spots with black rims. “They look like a tricolored leopard spot,” Stack Morgan says. Perseverance examined the spots with instruments that can identify their chemical contents and found that the rims contain iron phosphate molecules. On Earth, rings with similar texture and chemistry are associated with ancient microbial life. The chemical reactions that create the rings can be an energy source for microbes. “They don’t require life, of course, and that’s an important caveat,” Stack Morgan says. “But based on our experience with similar things on Earth, there is a possibility that life could have been involved, and these could have a biological origin.” The rock has other confusing features that muddy the picture of how it formed, Stack Morgan says. It is shot through with white veins of calcium sulfate. These veins are filled with millimeter-sized crystals of olivine, a mineral that forms from magma. The inclusion of both the spots and these volcanic features in the same rock is “a little bit mysterious,” Stack Morgan says, as they point to different origins. Figuring out how the rock formed could help tell how likely it is to have had the right conditions and temperatures to host biology. Planetary scientist Paul Byrne thinks we should be circumspect about the finding. “Could this truly be a biosignature? Yes. And if it is, then it really is the kind of society-altering discovery that the discovery of truly extraterrestrial life would be,” says Byrne, of Washington University in St. Louis. But it’s also possible that the spots came from something other than life, “in which case all this is is an interesting example of water-rock chemistry.” The only way to find out for sure is to bring the rock home. A big part of Perseverance’s mission is to collect samples from interesting rocks for a future spacecraft to return to Earth, where they can be studied in more sophisticated laboratories than a rover can carry on its back. Perseverance has thrown everything it has at this rock already, Stack Morgan says. But funding uncertainty has recently put the program, known as Mars Sample Return, on hold (SN: 5/8/24). “With this sample, the rationale for MSR is strengthened even more, and should I hope motivate NASA to commit to pulling off this project sooner rather than later,” Byrne says. Stack Morgan says the rover team is carrying on despite the budget uncertainty. “We have a mission to carry out, and a job to do: collecting compelling samples,” Stack Morgan says. “It can only be our hope that the samples that we collect are compelling enough to justify the cost of Mars Sample Return. I think with this exciting sample, that really hits that home.” Questions or comments on this article?

A new method may cut wait time  Every print subscription comes with full digital access The test is crucial to figuring out what is causing a bloodstream infection, and fighting it A nurse holds tubes of collected blood from a patient. A new method of sepsis testing could speed treatment that targets the specific bacteria causing a blood infection. FLUXFACTORY/GETTY IMAGES By Claire Yuan JULY 24, 2024 AT 11:00 AM When bloodstream infections set in, fast treatment is crucial — but it can take several days to identify the bacteria responsible. A new, rapid-diagnosis sepsis test could cut down on the wait, reducing testing time from as much as a few days to about 13 hours by cutting out a lengthy blood culturing step, researchers report July 24 in Nature. “They are pushing the limits of rapid diagnostics for bloodstream infections,” says Pak Kin Wong, a biomedical engineer at Penn State who was not involved in the research. “They are driving toward a direction that will dramatically improve the clinical management of bloodstream infections and sepsis.” Sepsis — an immune system overreaction to an infection — is a life-threatening condition that strikes nearly 2 million people per year in the United States, killing more than 250,000 (SN: 5/18/08). The condition can also progress to septic shock, a steep drop in blood pressure that damages the kidneys, lungs, liver and other organs. It can be caused by a broad range of different bacteria, making species identification key for personalized treatment of each patient. In conventional sepsis testing, the blood collected from the patient must first go through a daylong blood culturing step to grow more bacteria for detection. The sample then goes through a second culture for purification before undergoing testing to find the best treatment. During the two to three days required for testing, patients are placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics — a blunt tool designed to stave off a mystery infection that’s better treated by targeted antibiotics after figuring out the specific bacteria causing the infection. Nanoengineer Tae Hyun Kim and colleagues found a way around the initial 24-hour blood culture. The workaround starts by injecting a blood sample with nanoparticles decorated with a peptide designed to bind to a wide range of blood-borne pathogens. Magnets then pull out the nanoparticles, and the bound pathogens come with them. Those bacteria are sent directly to the pure culture. Thanks to this binding and sorting process, the bacteria can grow faster without extraneous components in the sample, like blood cells and the previously given broad-spectrum antibiotics, says Kim, of Seoul National University in South Korea. Cutting out the initial blood culturing step also relies on a new imaging algorithm, Kim says. To test bacteria’s susceptibility to antibiotics, both are placed in the same environment, and scientists observe if and how the antibiotics stunt the bacteria’s growth or kill them. The team’s image detection algorithm can detect subtler changes than the human eye can. So it can identify the species and antibiotic susceptibility with far fewer bacteria cells than the conventional method, thereby reducing the need for long culture times to produce larger colonies. Though the new method shows promise, Wong says, any new test carries a risk of false negatives, missing bacteria that are actually present in the bloodstream. That in turn can lead to not treating an active infection, and “undertreatment of bloodstream infection can be fatal,” he says. “While the classical blood culture technique is extremely slow, it is very effective in avoiding false negatives.” Following their laboratory-based experiments, Kim and colleagues tested their new method clinically, running it in parallel with conventional sepsis testing on 190 hospital patients with suspected infections. The testing obtained a 100 percent match on correct bacterial species identification, the team reports. Though more clinical tests are needed, these accuracy results are encouraging so far, Kim says. The team is continuing to refine their design in hopes of developing a fully automated sepsis blood test that can quickly produce results, even when hospital laboratories are closed overnight. “We really wanted to commercialize this and really make it happen so that we could make impacts to the patients,” Kim says.

The experts made a surprising discovery during their investigation using a microcamera.  They found that it was feasible to physically unseal and open the 2,000-year-old stone coffin, also known as a sarcophagus, which had remained untouched for centuries (Photo: Superintendence archaeology fine arts & landscape for the naples metropolitan area) In 2023, archaeologists made a remarkable discovery in Giugliano when they unearthed the perimeter of an ancient necropolis. This finding led them to uncover a structure that was later identified as the entrance to a chamber tomb, now known as the 'tomb of Cerberus.' Upon further investigation, the archaeologists were astounded by the presence of a captivating fresco within the tomb. The fresco showcased Cerberus, the legendary three-headed dog from ancient Greek mythology. (Photo: Superintendence archaeology fine arts & landscape for the Naples metropolitan area) Guigliano, a town situated in the Campania region of Italy, has a rich history dating back to ancient times. The area was settled by Greek colonizers during the period spanning the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Archaeologists from the Superintendency of Archaeology, Fine Arts, and Landscape made a startling discovery when they uncovered a tomb containing remarkably well-preserved bodies. The team was astonished not only by the condition of the remains but also by the unique preservation technique employed. The mummies, which have yet to be publicly showcased through images, were treated with a distinctive mixture of herbs. The ancient embalmers utilized a cream consisting of chenopodium, ""a genus of perennial herb colloquially known as goosefoot,"" and ""absinthium (wormwood)"" to preserve the bodies. (Photo: Superintendence archaeology fine arts & landscape for the Naples metropolitan area) Mariano Nuzzo, an archaeology superintendent working for the Italian Ministry of Culture, stated in a press release that ""The Tomb of Cerberus continues to provide valuable information on the Phlegraean territory near Liternum, expanding knowledge of the past, and, and offering opportunities for research also of a multidisciplinary nature.""

The rollout could have implications for Google and its dominant search engine. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Alphabet investors have been concerned that OpenAI could take market share from Google in search by giving consumers new ways to seek information online.  With this prototype, OpenAI is testing the waters for doing just that, promising users the chance to “search in a more natural, intuitive way” and ask follow-up questions “just like you would in a conversation.” “We think there is room to make search much better than it is today,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote Thursday in a post on X. Alphabet shares fell more than 3% on Thursday to close at $167.28, while the Nasdaq was down less than 1%. In May, Google launched AI Overview, which CEO Sundar Pichai called the biggest change in search in 25 years, to a limited audience, allowing users to see a summary of answers to queries at the very top of Google Search. Though Google had been working on AI Overview for more than a year, public criticism mounted after  users quickly noticed that queries returned nonsensical or inaccurate results within the AI feature — without any way to opt out. “Google has been kind of shaking in their boots a little bit since this stuff first popped off,” said Daniel Faggella, founder and head of research at Emerj Artificial Intelligence Research, referring to generative artificial intelligence. “We haven’t seem their company crumble in the interim, but we have seen them kind of fumble.”  The SearchGPT announcement follows OpenAI’s launch last Thursday of a new AI model, “GPT-4o mini.” The new model is an offshoot of GPT-4o, the startup’s fastest and most powerful model to date, which it launched in May during a livestreamed event with executives.  OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, has been valued at more than $80 billion by investors. The company, founded in 2015, is under pressure to stay on top of the generative AI market while finding ways to make money as it spends massive sums on processors and infrastructure to build and train its models. Last Month, OpenAI announced the hiring of two top executives as well as a partnership with Apple that includes a ChatGPT-Siri integration. Sarah Friar, previously CEO of Nextdoor and finance chief at Square, joined as chief financial officer, and Kevin Weil, an ex-president at Planet Labs and former senior vice president at Twitter and a vice president at Facebook and Instagram, joined as chief product officer. OpenAI is bolstering its C-suite as its large language models gain importance across the tech sector and as competition rapidly emerges in the burgeoning generative AI market.  Both OpenAI’s new mini AI model and the prototype of SearchGPT are also part of the company’s push to be at the forefront of “multimodality,” or the ability to offer a wide range of types of AI-generated media, like text, images, audio, video and search, inside one tool: ChatGPT. For SearchGPT, OpenAI’s blog post said the tool’s visual results will lead to “richer understanding” for users. Last year, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC, “The world is multimodal.” He added that as humans “engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things,” so limiting interactions to text is insufficient.

Follow WALL Street stocks rose and the Dow scored a second consecutive all-time closing high on Friday (Aug 30), with Tesla and Amazon climbing after fresh US economic data raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates modestly in September. US consumer spending increased solidly in July, suggesting the economy remained strong while prices rose moderately. “Investors are seeing another sign of being in a soft landing,” said Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at Newedge Wealth.  “It’s another one of those Goldilocks kind of reports really threading a needle right down the centre. The market is really getting exactly what it wanted.” A “just-right” Goldilocks economy has steady growth, but not too much that it fuels excessive inflation. Amazon.com and Tesla each jumped over 3 per cent. Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Broadcom rallied nearly 4 per cent, while Marvell Technology surged 9 per cent after the chipmaker forecast quarterly results above estimates. The personal consumption expenditures report came on Friday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week expressed support for an imminent policy adjustment. Economic data next week includes the Labor Department’s August jobs report, due on Friday. Money markets suggest traders mostly expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in September, with odds of a 50 basis point cut dimming further after Friday’s data, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. Friday ended a tumultuous month on Wall Street after signs of a sudden moderation in the labour market in early August sparked fears of a US recession. The influence of the Japanese yen carry trade worsened the rout. Shares have rebounded since then, with the S&P 500 trading near record highs. Ahead of Monday’s US stock market holiday for Labor Day, volume on US exchanges was relatively light, with 11.2 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.4 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions. The S&P 500 climbed 1 per cent to end at 5,648.40 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.1 per cent to 17,713.62 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 41,563.08 points. All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by consumer discretionary, up 1.9 per cent, followed by a 1.1 per cent gain in industrials. For the month, the S&P 500 rose 2.3 per cent, the Dow added 1.8 per cent and the Nasdaq climbed 0.6 per cent. Nvidia rose 1.5 per cent, rebounding from a 6.4 per cent drop on Thursday after the artificial intelligence (AI) chip bellwether failed to match sky-high investor expectations, despite upbeat results and a broadly in-line forecast. Novavax surged 8.6 per cent after the US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for an updated version of its Covid shot. Ulta Beauty slid 4 per cent after it trimmed its annual results forecasts, citing slowing demand for higher-priced cosmetics and fragrances at its stores. Intel jumped almost 10 per cent following a report it was exploring options that could include a merger. Dell Technologies, another AI-related stock, advanced 4.3 per cent after lifting its annual revenue and profit forecasts. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, majority owned by former US President Donald Trump, dipped 1.7 per cent to a record low, leaving its stock market value at US$3.9 billion. Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 6.6-to-one ratio. The S&P 500 posted 79 new highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 84 new highs and 77 new lows.

Investors are worried after Friday’s jobs report showed U.S. employers pulled back on hiring in July. (AP video: Joseph B. Frederick)                     NEW YORK (AP) — Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index soared nearly 11% early Tuesday, a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street. The Japanese index advanced more than 3,300 points, not quite making up for the huge loss of more than 4,400 points the day before, when it plunged 12.4% in its worst single-day decline since 1987. The scary Monday started with a plunge abroad reminiscent of 1987 ’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S. economy. The S&P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt. The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week, and it was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation. Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday. Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.  That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.89%. “The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.” Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part “because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major financial imbalances.” Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits. “Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.” The only way for stocks to look less expensive is either for prices to fall or for their profits to strengthen. Expectations are still high for the latter, with growth for S&P 500 profits this past quarter looking to be the strongest since 2021. Professional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world. Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market. Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “ Magnificent Seven ” had propelled the S&P 500 to record after record this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market. But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines. Apple fell 4.8% Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker. Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the poster child of Wall Street’s AI bonanza, fell even more, 6.4%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia’s new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia’s gain for the year to nearly 103% from 170% in the middle of June. Another Big Tech titan, Alphabet, fell 4.4% after a U.S. judge ruled Google’s search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. All told, the S&P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to 16,200.08. Worries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That’s adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things. Wall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself. The threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy. “It comes down to jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy. “When we get to election day, the unemployment rate is going to be extremely important.” AP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach, Matt Ott, Christopher Rugaber and Damian J.
