5|Olympic Champion Simone Biles Posted on Social Media That She Loves her ‘Black Job’|Simone Biles says she loves her ‘black job,’ an apparent clapback at Donald Trump   After the final Olympic Gold winner Simone Biles said three years ago she wasn’t sure whether she could compete again, but that she had “worked really hard, mentally and physically” with the help of her team.   Olympic gymnastics champion Simone Biles entered the fray of the U.S. presidential race on Friday with a post that appears to clap back at former President Donald Trump’s comment about “Black jobs.” “I love my black job,” Biles posted on X, in response to a post from singer Ricky Davila, who had said: “Iconic photo of the GOAT mastering her black job and collecting Gold Medals.” The exchange came hours after Biles held off Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade to win the all-around Paris Olympics gymnastics finals, taking home her ninth gold medal. At 27, she’s the oldest Olympic women’s gymnastics champ since 1952. Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has been criticized for arguing during his June debate with Democratic President Joe Biden that migrants are taking “Black jobs” and “Hispanic jobs” from Americans. Trump’s remark angered critics, who called it a racist and insulting attempt to expand his appeal beyond his white conservative base. When pushed by moderators on what constituted a “Black job,” Trump told attendees at this week’s National Association of Black Journalists conference that “a Black job is anybody that has a job,” drawing groans from the room. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has been critical of Biles before. During a 2021 Fox News Channel appearance, following Biles’ withdrawal from that year’s Olympics competition to protect her own safety in Tokyo — a self-removal that prompted an international discussion about mental health — Vance questioned why the athlete didn’t push forward.  “I think it reflects pretty poorly on our sort of therapeutic society that we try to praise people, not for moments of strength, not for moments of heroism, but for their weakest moments,” Vance, who was then running for his Senate seat, said at the time. Trump’s campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment on what Biles posted. Biles’ representatives also did not immediately return messages seeking further comment on her post or her thoughts generally about the 2024 U.S. presidential election. ___ Meg Kinnard reported from Chapin, S.C., and can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP.

On Saturday, Kangana shared a morphed picture of Rahul Gandhi on her IG stories that showed him in a skull cap, with turmeric tika on his forehead and a cross necklace. She was taking a jibe at him for his recent remarks on caste census in the Parliament. Hours later, she was trending on Twitter for the ‘trolling’. (Also read: Kangana Ranaut calls Rahul Gandhi ‘pasta with kadi patta tadka’ amid his caste row with Anurag Thakur) With the picture, Kangana wrote, “Jaati jivi jise bina jaati pooche jaati ganana karani hai (He who wishes to hold a caste census without asking anyone's caste).” 'Kangana' is currently trending on Twitter with upwards of 20,000 tweets. Many have called her a ‘troll’ who is unfit for the Parliament. “This is an appeal to @siddaramaiah, @revanth_anumula and @mkstalin. Kangana Ranaut has shared shameful below belt morphed image of Rahul Gandhi on Instagram. This is the time she gets dragged in court, just an online FIR won't do the trick. This is absolutely sick from #KanganaRanaut and she just can't be left unpunished,” read a tweet.  “People are watching.. They'll give answer to your Hatred,” wrote another person. “Kangana Ranaut mocked Rahul Gandhi over the caste census, but she has had many flop films like *Tejas*, *Dhakad*, *Thalaivi*, and more. Given her own failures, she shouldn't troll others. Rahul Gandhi is a very popular leader and doesn't need defending,” read another tweet. “Shame on Kangana Ranaut 👎👎👎 What kind of manners your parents gave you. Please @INCIndia take action,” read another tweet. However, a few even supported Kangana and told her to keep such posts coming. Recently, Kangana shared old videos of Rahul invoking caste in public meetings on her Instagram stories. She wrote, “Apni jaat ka kuch ata pata nahi, nanu Muslim, dadi Parsi, mummy Christian aur khud aisa lagta hai jaise Pasta ko kadi patte ka tadka lagakar kichadi banane ki koshish ki ho, aur inko sabki jaat pata karni hai. (You know nothing of your own caste, your grandfather is Muslim, grandmother Parsi, mummy Christian and it feels like someone tempered pasta with curry leaves to make rice and lentils, but he wants to know everyone’s caste.)” She also added, “How can he be publicly ask people their caste in such a crude, condescending manner, shame on Rahul Gandhi.” Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused BJP MP Anurag Thakur of ‘insulting and abusing’ him in the Lok Sabha during the discussion on the Union Budget. BJP MP Anurag had said, “Those whose caste is not known, talk about the caste census.” without taking anyone’s name. He later stated, “I had said that someone who doesn't know about caste talks about census. I did not name anyone.” Rahul, who had promised a nationwide census if INDIA bloc came into power, replied, “You can insult me as much as you like but we will pass the caste census in Parliament. Anurag Thakur has abused me and insulted me. But I do not want any apology from him.”|True|False

By Santul Nerkar Whole Foods did not violate the law when it punished employees for wearing apparel supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, a federal administrative judge ruled on Wednesday. The judge for the National Labor Relations Board, Ariel Sotolongo, said Whole Foods had not violated the labor rights of employees in 2020 when it disciplined them for wearing masks, pins and other accessories emblazoned with the “Black Lives Matter” slogan. The judge wrote that wearing the apparel was not connected “with their employment or working conditions.” The employees will be able to appeal the decision to the labor board. The case was brought in July 2020 by 14 employees in four states who said the grocery chain had illegally disciplined them while citing its dress code policy. The workers said they had been sent home without pay or fired for wearing apparel with the slogan. Whole Foods denied retaliating against employees. “Our diverse culture continues to be a source of great pride for Whole Foods Market, and we remain focused on creating both a safe and inclusive workplace for all,” the company said in a statement on Thursday. “We are pleased with the outcome of this case.” ADVERTISEMENT The lawyer representing the workers, Shannon Liss-Riordan, said she was disappointed by the ruling. “If employees have a good-faith belief that they are taking an action to promote and to improve the terms and conditions of their workplace, that is protected activity,” she said. One employee at a store in Cambridge, Mass., Savannah Kinzer, testified that she had decided to start wearing apparel with the Black Lives Matter slogan in June 2020 because other stores had sent employees home for wearing similar apparel, according to news articles she had read. Along with several dozen co-workers, Ms. Kinzer repeatedly wore a Black Lives Matter-themed mask from late June to early July. She and her colleagues were told that they were violating the company’s dress code and were dismissed early from their shifts, without pay. Eventually, she was fired after being late to work. Many companies embraced the Black Lives Matter movement after the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020. Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, pledged $10 million to organizations that “bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and African Americans.” Whole Foods posted on its website that “racism has no place here” and that it supported “the Black community and meaningful change in the world.” But workers who brought the complaint against the company said that support did not extend to employees who wanted to support the movement, which has sought to draw attention to the police killings of Black people and systemic racism in the workplace, housing, education and other areas. ADVERTISEMENT The judge’s decision was the latest ruling in favor of Whole Foods against employees who said they had been retaliated against for supporting Black Lives Matter. In January, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by three former employees who said they had been illegally fired for wearing Black Lives Matter masks. And in June 2022, a federal appeals court found that Whole Foods had not violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by banning Black Lives Matter apparel.

15|Decode Politics: How a Yogi govt Bill ran into a wall raised by senior UP BJP leaders|Decode Politics: How a Yogi govt Bill ran into a wall raised by senior UP BJP leaders  In another attempt to project a united front in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP ensured that both its Deputy Chief Ministers in the state were present alongside CM Yogi Adityanath at the Legislature Party meeting convened before the start of the Monsoon Session of the Assembly this week. Days later, that front is again showing cracks. First, the Adityanath government’s Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilization for Public Purposes) Bill ran into objections from the BJP’s own ranks in the Assembly, with City West, Prayagraj, MLA and former minister Sidharth Nath Singh and Prayagraj MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai expressing apprehensions over the legislation. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna even intervened while Bajpai was speaking to appeal: “Aap samajh nahi rahe ho. Pahle padh toh lo (You do not understand the Bill. First, go through it carefully).” BJP ally NISHAD Party’s Anil Tripathi then joined Singh and Bajpai in expressing his misgivings. Then, a day after the Bill cleared the Assembly, the Legislative Council sent it to a Select Committee for further scrutiny. The demand was first made by UP BJP chief and MLC Bhupendra Chaudhary, and supported by Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, who has launched a covert rebellion against Adityanath. While Adityanath in his capacity as CM is the Leader of the BJP in the Assembly, Maurya is the leader of the BJP in the Council. The BJP and allies enjoy a clear majority in both the Houses, which means that it is rare for a Bill to be sent to a Select Committee, that too on a demand made from the Treasury Benches. Nazul land is land originally acquired during the colonial period for specific purposes such as public utilities, administrative functions or for the settlement of displaced individuals. Over time, this land has been used or leased for various public and private purposes. As per the proposed Bill, Nazul land in the state will now be reserved and used exclusively for public purposes. Any court proceedings or applications requesting the transfer of ownership of Nazul land to private individuals or institutions will be cancelled and automatically rejected. In case payments have been made in anticipation of such ownership changes, the amounts are to be refunded. The government could choose to extend the leases of current leaseholders of Nazul land, provided they are in good standing, regularly paying rent, and have not violated lease terms. While BJP leaders as well as the Opposition say they have raised objections to the Bill in “public interest”, the legislation in fact replaces an ordinance that has been in implementation since March this year. The ordinance did not see any significant opposition when it was passed by the Adityanath Cabinet. On Thursday, when Chaudhary proposed that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee, even Opposition members were initially caught off-guard, not knowing how to respond. Even as the latter neither backed nor opposed Chaudhary’s proposal, other BJP leaders expressed their support for Chaudhary, with Maurya indicating it by raising his hand. The other Deputy CM, Brajesh Pathak, was seated next to Maurya in his capacity as minister. He could not vote on the proposal as he is a member of the Assembly and not the Council, but as soon as the decision was taken to send the Bill to the Select Committee, Pathak and Maurya were seen shaking hands. While the Bill saw a discussion in the Assembly on July 31, before it was passed by a voice vote, there was no discussion on it in the Upper House on August 1 before it was sent to the Select Committee. In the Assembly, noting that “governments work in continuation”, Sidharth Nath Singh suggested that those who have been residing on such land for ages and near the end of their lease should be given the opportunity to get an extension. He also suggested that with previous governments alternatively allowing freehold of the land or stopping it, those who continued to pay their instalments after freehold should also be considered. The Indian Express spoke to some members of the Legislative Council, where the Bill saw no discussion. They admitted they had not read the Bill, but added that they knew it would be recommended for Select Committee appraisal as “the public is against the provisions of the Bill”. They could not say what these provisions were. A BJP MLC said: “When the organisational head makes a proposal, we have to follow. He (Chaudhary) is not just a member of the Council but also the head of the state organisation. Even the Leader of our House and Deputy CM Keshav ji supported it. Many people have been approaching us against the provisions as it would displace poor people who have been residing on Nuzul lands for generations… The new law would have given the government the power to take it back at will.” Asked why they did not object when the ordinance was moved, the BJP MLC said he “did not know about that”. “We had to support sending it to the Select Committee, and we did.” About the surprisingly vociferous intervention by BJP MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai on the matter, Prayagraj Mahanagar BJP president Rajendra Mishra said: “Harshvardhan ji is a two-term MLA and always speaks his mind and raises his voice for the people.” He added: “Harshavardhan ji only speaks and works according to the policy and agenda of the party and government.” Bajpai is the grandson of Rajendra Kumar Bajpai, a veteran Congress leader and former Union minister who was seen as close to Indira Gandhi. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav Friday demanded the permanent withdrawal of the “inhuman” Nazul Bill. Taking a swipe at Adityanath in a post on X, Akhilesh said: “The Nazul land issue is entirely a decision to uproot homes because a bulldozer cannot run over every house… What will the BJP gain by demolishing settled homes? Will the BJP render people homeless for the benefit of land mafias?” On Thursday, soon after the Bill was sent to a Select Committee, Akhilesh said the BJP government wanted the law for “the personal benefit” of some people. “There are many such lands in Gorakhpur which some people want to grab to expand their sphere of influence… It is hoped that the Chief Minister will take suo motu cognisance and will not let any such plan succeed, especially in Gorakhpur,” he wrote on X. Gorakhpur is Adityanath’s political turf. Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates In Bangladesh turmoil, a lesson for the Global South|True|True

Multiple rounds of heavy rain could lead to flooding. by JACKSON WALKER   The National Desk TOPICS: WASHINGTON (TND) — X owner Elon Musk and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., clashed on social media Wednesday over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s congressional address. Protesters took to the streets of Washington, D.C., during the address to protest the ongoing war in Gaza. Demonstrators burned the American flag while hoisting Palestinian flags. AOC, one of several members of Congress who boycotted Netanyahu’s address, took to X to accuse lawmakers of falsifying support for Netanyahu. “Just so we’re clear, Netanyahu has lost so many people that he is addressing just a fraction of Congress,” she wrote. “When this happens, they fill the seats with non-members, like what they do at award ceremonies, in order to project the appearance of full attendance and support.” Musk, who was in attendance at the address as Netanyahu’s guest, fired back and accused AOC of directing hatred toward Jewish people.  “Hmm,” Rep. Ocasio-Cortez replied. “Sometimes being quiet is free and good for you.” The Democrat included in her reply a screenshot of an article accusing Musk of sharing antisemitic content on X.

Several Dalit groups, excluding those who work in the leather industry, have been seeking quota within the overall 20% SC quota to help them avail the benefits of reservation. The Dalit A Mahapanchayat is one of them. However, the group that works in the leather industry and enjoys a level of affluence has been opposed, saying such a measure would hurt Dalit unity. After Thursday’s order, they said they would be meeting BJP leaders to demand that the status quo be maintained on the issue in Haryana. With the Assembly polls in Haryana coming soon, both sides realise that they can put pressure on parties to concede their demands. Dalit-A Mahapanchayat president Devi Das Valmiki said: “We will hold a big rally if a quota within the SC quota for government jobs is not given before the Assembly polls.” The Dalit A Mahapanchayat also believes it has a strong case because, in March 2020, conceding the demand of Dalit groups like it, the Haryana Assembly had passed a Bill creating a quota within the SC quota for seats in the state’s higher educational institutions for a newly designated “Deprived Scheduled Castes” category. This category includes 36 communities, such as the Valmikis, Bazigars, Sansis, Dehas, Dhanaks and Saperas. The Dalit A Mahapanchayat wants a similar sub-quota now for government jobs. According to government sources, the ‘Deprived Scheduled Castes’ cover almost the entire SC category, which comprises around 11% of the state’s population. Haryana was an interested party in the case before the Supreme Court as in 1994, the then Congress government in the state led by Bhajan Lal had bifurcated the SC quota into two groups – ‘Block A’, comprising the more deprived Dalit groups, and ‘Block B’, comprising the Dalits working in the leather industry. In 2006, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had quashed the 1994 notification, citing the decision of a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the E V Chinnaiah vs State Of Andhra Pradesh And Others case. On Thursday, a seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court overruled this order. Devi Das Valmiki told The Indian Express: “The current BJP government should have implemented the quota within the SC reservation in government jobs too when it introduced one for admission in educational institutions in 2020. After the latest Supreme Court decision, it should be implemented as early as possible, without delay. The ball is now in the court of the state government.” He called the Supreme Court decision a “lifeline” for them. “From 1966 to now, no one from our community has become a Lok Sabha MP from Haryana, even as the state has two seats reserved for SCs.” Devi Das Valmiki claimed that after the 2004 apex court order, “even the graduates or postgraduates from our communities did not get enough employment in the state”. However, the president of the Hisar unit of the ‘Dr B R Ambedkar Sabha’, Raghubir Sunda, termed the Supreme Court order “unfortunate”, warning that it could have “adverse effects for SCs”. “A significant number of government posts out of the 20% set aside for SCs are lying vacant in Haryana with the remark ‘not found a suitable candidate’. The Supreme Court judgment would just increase this backlog for government jobs. More government posts for SCs will fall vacant. Even in educational institutions, the representation of SCs has decreased after the implementation of a quota within the SC quota,” Sunda claimed. He added: “When there is no caste-based census, then how can such a decision be implemented?” Independent voices within SC groups called for unity among community members in “the larger interest”. A Scheduled Caste leader who did not wish to be identified said: “This is the time for unity among SCs for upliftment of the community members.

JIMMY DAY, MIT MEDIA LAB By Nikk Ogasa MAY 23, 2023 AT 8:00 AM Deblina Sarkar makes little machines, for which she has big dreams. The machines are so little, in fact, that they can humbly inhabit living cells. And her dreams are so big, they may one day save your mind. Sarkar is a nanotechnologist and assistant professor at MIT. She develops ultratiny electronic devices, some smaller than a mote of dust, that she hopes will one day enter the brain. She’s also a fan of Kung Fu movies and likes to dance her own twist on bharata natyam, a classical Indian dance form. Occasionally she goes hiking with her graduate students, once taking them as far as Yellowstone. Building camaraderie is vital, Sarkar says. But “I’m probably working day and night on my research,” she confesses. “There is an urgent problem at hand.” That problem is Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological afflictions that assault the minds of millions of people worldwide. Sarkar’s solution: Employ minute machines to detect and reverse these disorders. “She was always interested in applying … electronics to biological systems,” says collaborator and bioengineering researcher Samir Mitragotri of Harvard University, who has known Sarkar for about a decade and was on her thesis committee. She envisions using her tools to “transform how people are conducting biology,” he says, “bridging the worlds.” Born in Kolkata, India, Sarkar credits both of her parents as early inspirations. Her boldness as a researcher comes from her mother, who as a young woman defied social norms in her village by working to fund her own education and speaking out against the dowry system. Meanwhile, Sarkar’s father sparked her fascination for engineering. At the age of 15, he abandoned his dreams of becoming an engineer to find other jobs; he needed to support his parents and the rest of his family after his father, an Indian freedom fighter, was shot in the leg and could no longer work. Still, Sarkar recalls her father finding time for his passion, fashioning devices to make home life more convenient. These included an electricity-free washing machine and vehicles that could freight hefty loads down local byroads to their house. “That got me very, very interested in science and technology,” Sarkar says. “Engineering specifically.” After earning a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Dhanbad, Sarkar moved to California to study nanoelectronics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. There, she tested new ways to create nanodevices that could reduce the amount of power consumed by computers and other everyday electronics. One standout device Sarkar developed during her graduate work was a transistor that reduced the amount of power lost as heat by 90 percent compared with some of today’s most common silicon transistors (SN: 3/18/22). For the breakthrough, UC Santa Barbara awarded Sarkar’s Ph.D. dissertation the Lancaster Award for its impact in advancing math, physical sciences and engineering. Along the way, Sarkar became fascinated with the brain, which she calls “the lowest energy computer.” A project imaging amyloid-beta plaques as a postdoc at MIT opened the door to fusing her dual interests, and she stayed on as an assistant professor to found the Nano-Cybernetic Biotrek group. Her group develops nanodevices that can interface with living cells, and “neuromorphic” computing devices, which have architectures inspired by the human brain and nervous system.   So far, the group’s most innovative device may be the Cell Rover, a flat antenna that could monitor processes inside cells. For a study reported in 2022, Sarkar and her colleagues used magnetic fields to finesse a Cell Rover, roughly the size of a tardigrade, into a mature frog egg cell. The team demonstrated that when stimulated by a magnetic field created by an alternating current, molecules in the nanodevice vibrated at frequencies safe for living cells. Using a wire coil receiver, the researchers were able to detect how those vibrations affected the device’s own magnetic field, thus showing it could communicate with the outside world. Cell Rovers could be outfitted with films that latch onto and detect select proteins or other biomolecules. Sarkar envisions using the device to spot misfolded proteins in the brain that may be early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Today, memory loss is the only way to know a living person has Alzheimer’s, but by then, the damage is irreversible, Sarkar says. Cell Rovers could also be paired with nanodevices that harvest energy from and electrically stimulate cells, opening the door for new types of brain electrodes and subcellular pacemakers. Or fleets of remotely controlled devices could replace invasive surgeries — detecting a small tumor growing in the brain, for example, and maybe even killing it. She’s essentially establishing a new field of science, at the intersection of nanoelectronics and biology, Mitragotri says. “There are many opportunities for the future.” One day, Sarkar hopes to insert nanodevices between human neurons to boost the computing speed of the fleshy processor already in our skulls. Our brains are remarkable, she says, but “we could be better than what we are.” Deblina Sarkar is one of this year’s SN 10: Scientists to Watch, our list of 10 early and mid-career scientists who are making extraordinary contributions to their field.

37|"""Tobey Maguire and Babette Strijbos Seemingly Ignore Each Other at Crowded Beach in Italy"""|If the modeling world had a high school yearbook, Vittoria Ceretti would probably win “Most Likely to Make Everyone Else Jealous.” Born and raised in Brescia, Italy, Vittoria grew up with a name that sounds like it was meant for the runway. From a young age, it was clear she wasn’t destined for an ordinary life. “Vittoria was always strutting around the house in my heels,” her mother once reminisced. “We used to joke that she was practicing for the day she’d be on the cover of Vogue.” Little did they know, that day would come sooner than expected. Her big break came when she was just 14 years old, after participating in the Elite Model Look competition in 2012. Vittoria didn’t win, but she certainly didn’t go unnoticed. Elite Model Management snapped her up faster than you can say “catwalk,” and thus began her meteoric rise to fame. From there, it was a whirlwind of flashing cameras and fashion capitals. Milan, Paris, New York – you name it, she strutted it. Her first major campaign was with Dolce & Gabbana, which was soon followed by appearances in nearly every high-profile runway show and glossy magazine cover imaginable. Chanel, Valentino, and Fendi were just a few of the heavyweights that sought her out. With each strut, each pose, she cemented herself as a force to be reckoned with in the fashion world. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Leonardo DiCaprio was collecting supermodels like others collect stamps. His dating history reads like a who’s who of the modeling world, with a penchant for women who look like they’ve just stepped off a magazine cover and are under the age of 25. In the ’90s and early 2000s, Leo was linked with a bevy of beauties. Remember Gisele Bündchen? Before she was Mrs. Tom Brady, she was Leonardo’s leading lady. They dated from 2000 to 2005, a period during which every red carpet they graced together probably required a sunglasses advisory due to their combined star power. Post-Gisele, there was Bar Refaeli. Their on-again, off-again romance kept tabloids busy from 2005 until they called it quits for good in 2011. Blake Lively even made a brief appearance in the DiCaprio dating diary in 2011, a pairing that seemed almost too beautiful to handle. And then came the pattern. Each year, Leo seemed to usher in a new era with a new face, each one seemingly younger than the last. By the time he split from Camila Morrone in 2022, a month after her 25th birthday, the internet was awash with jokes about Leo’s aversion to women over a quarter of a century old. So how did the perennial bachelor meet the Italian beauty? Picture this: It’s a hot night in August 2023, in the throbbing heart of Ibiza’s nightlife scene. The music is pumping, the drinks are flowing, and the crowd is a mix of sunburned tourists and bronzed celebrities. Amidst this backdrop, Leonardo DiCaprio and Vittoria Ceretti lock eyes. A source close to the couple (and by that, we mean a friend of a friend of someone who once saw them at Starbucks) claimed that “Leo couldn’t take his eyes off her. She walked in like she owned the place, and from that moment, he was hooked.” A grainy video obtained by Page Six shows Leo, baseball cap firmly in place, leaning in to kiss Vittoria in the early hours of the morning. “It was like something out of a movie,” an eyewitness said. “One minute they were talking, the next they were locking lips. Classic Leo.” From Ibiza, the romance moved swiftly to more intimate settings. They were spotted in Santa Barbara, enjoying iced coffee and ice cream – because nothing says love like shared lactose. Then came the dinners at Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica, a place Leo has frequented more than some people visit their mothers. “She’s, of course, Italian,” a friend said. “So she takes care of ordering all the favorites.” Their chemistry was undeniable, and public displays of affection became a regular occurrence. Of course, no DiCaprio romance would be complete without a media circus. The moment they were spotted together, tabloids went into overdrive. Headlines screamed, “Leo’s New Love!” and “Is This the One?” as paparazzi photos of the couple became a daily staple. Social media buzzed with fans’ reactions. Some were supportive, thrilled that Leo seemed genuinely smitten. Others couldn’t resist poking fun at his infamous dating habits. “Congrats to Leo DiCaprio’s girlfriend on her inevitable 25th birthday!” one tweet read, garnering thousands of likes. Then came the engagement rumors. Vittoria was seen sporting a heart-shaped diamond ring, and speculation went wild. Was Leo finally ready to settle down? Would the infamous bachelor tie the knot? Comparisons to his previous relationships were inevitable. “This feels different,” one entertainment pundit noted. “Leo’s never been this public with his affection before. Maybe she really is the one.” But, as always with celebrity romances, only time will tell. For now, the world watches, waits, and eagerly refreshes their social media feeds for the next chapter in the love story of Leonardo DiCaprio and Vittoria Ceretti.  Imagine a life where your biggest dilemma is whether to sunbathe on a yacht off the coast of Sardinia or dive into the azure waters of Portofino. Welcome to the world of Leonardo DiCaprio and Vittoria Ceretti, where romantic getaways are as frequent as your average person’s trips to the grocery store. Their Sardinia adventure was the stuff of dreams—or Instagram stories. Paparazzi caught them lounging on a lavish yacht, looking effortlessly chic. Vittoria, in a brown two-piece bikini, resembled a modern-day Venus emerging from the sea. Leo, not to be outdone, sported dark green swim trunks and a silver chain, the epitome of casual cool. “It’s like he’s perfected the art of looking both underdressed and incredibly stylish at the same time,” one fan commented on Twitter. The couple’s trip to Portofino was equally picturesque. They were spotted exploring the quaint, colorful streets, stopping at local cafes, and enjoying gelato. It was during this trip that Leo’s best pal, Tobey Maguire, joined in on the fun. At one point, Tobey and Vittoria were seen jet-skiing together, a sight that sparked a wave of memes. “Spiderman and the Supermodel: The Next Marvel Blockbuster?” joked one Instagram user. Their beach outings are a regular feature in tabloids. Whether they’re in Malibu or the Maldives, Leo and Vittoria manage to turn a simple swim into a spectacle. One onlooker at a Malibu beach noted, “They looked so in sync. It’s like watching a romantic comedy unfold in real life, minus the awkward mishaps.” These vacations are more than just Instagram-worthy moments. They reflect the couple’s relationship dynamics. “Leo loves to travel, and Vittoria is the perfect partner in crime. She’s adventurous, loves the water, and they both appreciate the finer things in life,” a close friend shared. Their shared love for exploration and luxury cements their bond, making their time together as seamless as their tan lines. When it comes to friends, Leonardo DiCaprio has one of the most star-studded entourages in Hollywood, and Vittoria fits right in. Leading the pack is Tobey Maguire, Leo’s wingman since their days in the ‘Pussy Posse’—a group of young actors known for their wild antics in the ’90s. These days, Tobey is more likely to be found packing on the PDA with his model girlfriend, Babette Strijbos, than causing trouble. “Leo and Tobey are like brothers,” said a mutual friend. “They’ve been through thick and thin together. Now, with Vittoria and Babette in the mix, it’s like one big happy family.” The foursome often vacation together, making every getaway a double date. The couple’s social circle isn’t limited to Hollywood actors. They’re frequently seen with a bevy of models and influencers. British model Neelam Gill and Entourage star Kevin Connolly are regulars in their glamorous gatherings. Former Vogue Editor-in-Chief Edward Enninful is another close confidant, often providing fashion advice and industry insights. Their influential friends have a significant impact on their relationship. “Being surrounded by such a creative and supportive group helps them stay grounded,” an insider explained. “They all share a mutual respect for each other’s careers and personal lives.” Public appearances for Leonardo and Vittoria are like royal parades—grand, stylish, and heavily photographed. Red carpet events are where they truly shine. At the Cannes Film Festival, the couple turned heads with their impeccable style. Vittoria, in a custom-made gown, looked like she had stepped out of a fairy tale, while Leo’s classic tuxedo reminded everyone why he’s Hollywood royalty. Their street style, however, tells a different story. “Leo is all about comfort. You’ll often see him in cargo shorts, a plain tee, and that infamous baseball cap,” remarked a fashion critic. Vittoria, on the other hand, mixes high fashion with everyday wear effortlessly. “She makes even the simplest outfits look runway-ready,” said a fellow model. The couple’s influence on each other’s style is evident. Leo has been spotted in more polished looks since they started dating, while Vittoria occasionally adopts a more laid-back approach, likely inspired by her beau. Media outlets can’t get enough of their fashion statements. “They’re the perfect blend of Hollywood glamour and casual chic,” one magazine gushed. No celebrity romance would be complete without some juicy insider stories. Friends and acquaintances are eager to share glimpses into Leo and Vittoria’s private lives, painting a picture of a couple deeply in love yet refreshingly down-to-earth. “Leo is completely smitten,” a close friend revealed. “He’s always been a charmer, but with Vittoria, it’s different. He’s more attentive, more present.” This sentiment is echoed by many in their inner circle. At a recent party, an onlooker noticed Leo barely leaving Vittoria’s side. “They were affectionate and seemed to be in their own little world,” the source said. Insider stories from private events are equally endearing. During a small gathering at Leo’s Malibu home, Vittoria reportedly took charge of the kitchen, whipping up Italian delicacies. “She’s a fantastic cook,” one guest raved. “Leo looked so proud, watching her handle everything with such ease.” Their compatibility is a hot topic among friends. “They balance each other out perfectly,” said a longtime acquaintance. “Leo can be intense, always thinking about his next project. Vittoria brings a sense of calm and fun into his life.” Insights into their daily routines reveal a couple that values simplicity amidst their glamorous lives. “They love quiet nights in,” a friend shared. “Watching movies, cooking together, or just relaxing. It’s not all yachts and red carpets.” From romantic getaways to their star-studded social circle, Leonardo and Vittoria’s relationship is as multifaceted as it is fascinating. With each public appearance and insider story, they continue to captivate the world, proving that even in the spotlight, love can thrive. When Vittoria Ceretti was spotted wearing a glittering diamond ring, the media went into a frenzy, speculating that Leonardo DiCaprio might finally be ready to settle down. “Is it happening? Is our eternal bachelor tying the knot?” screamed headlines everywhere. But before we all get carried away, let’s delve into the sparkling mystery of that ring. The origin of the ring remains a tantalizing enigma. It first appeared on Vittoria’s finger during a casual stroll in New York City. Paparazzi zoomed in, and within minutes, the internet was ablaze. “It’s definitely an engagement ring,” proclaimed one jewelry expert on a morning show, pointing to the size and cut of the diamond as telltale signs. Another expert, however, argued it could just be an extravagant gift, noting, “Celebrities often wear statement pieces without any significant meaning.” Naturally, the couple’s representatives were as elusive as a plot twist in a DiCaprio thriller. “No comments,” said their publicist, leaving fans and the media to draw their own conclusions. Historically, engagement rumors have plagued Leo’s relationships. Remember when Gisele Bündchen was seen sporting a ring, sparking similar speculation? Or when Bar Refaeli’s ring made headlines, only for it to turn out to be a piece of accessory, no more significant than a mood ring from a carnival? So, this isn’t exactly uncharted territory for Leo. Leonardo DiCaprio’s love life reads like a who’s who of the modeling world, with each relationship scrutinized more than the last. Comparing his current romance with Vittoria to past relationships reveals some intriguing patterns and notable differences. One thing’s for sure: Leo has a type. From Gisele to Bar, Blake Lively to Toni Garrn, there’s a definite preference for models who are as glamorous as they are gorgeous. But there’s something different about his dynamic with Vittoria. “With Vittoria, Leo seems more relaxed and genuinely happy,” a source close to the actor noted. “It’s not just about the glamour; it’s about compatibility.” Take, for example, his relationship with Gisele Bündchen. It was intense, passionate, and ultimately doomed by conflicting schedules and priorities. Leo was at the height of his career, with back-to-back film projects, while Gisele’s modeling career was skyrocketing. It was a classic case of two stars colliding but failing to merge. With Bar Refaeli, the relationship was more laid-back but eventually fizzled out due to similar reasons. Blake Lively, on the other hand, brought a touch of Hollywood into Leo’s life, yet the media frenzy and differing life goals led to their split. In contrast, Leo’s relationship with Vittoria seems to stand out. “There’s a maturity now that wasn’t there before,” remarked a friend of the couple. “Leo’s more settled, and Vittoria’s presence brings a balance to his life.” The question on everyone’s lips: Is Leonardo DiCaprio finally ready to say, “I do”? Analyzing the prospects of marriage for Leo and Vittoria is like predicting the next big twist in a Scorsese film—complex but fascinating. Compatibility is key, and by all accounts, Leo and Vittoria tick that box. “They share a love for art, nature, and travel,” said a source. “They both appreciate the finer things in life but also value privacy and downtime.” This shared outlook on life could bode well for their future together. Relationship experts and media analysts have weighed in with mixed predictions. Some believe that Leo, now in his late 40s, might finally be at a point where he’s ready for a long-term commitment. “People change, and Leo might be at that stage where he’s thinking about his legacy and personal life more seriously,” said a relationship expert on a talk show. However, others caution that the pressures of a high-profile relationship can be overwhelming. “The constant media scrutiny and public expectations can strain even the strongest bonds,” warned another analyst. Possible obstacles include their demanding careers and public scrutiny. Leo’s film projects often take him around the globe, while Vittoria’s modeling career demands significant travel as well. Balancing these careers with a personal life is no small feat. Fans, of course, have their hopes pinned on a fairy-tale ending. “If Leo gets married, it’ll be the wedding of the century,” tweeted one enthusiastic fan. Another commented, “It’s about time Leo settles down and starts a family. We’re rooting for them!” To understand the potential future of Leo and Vittoria’s relationship, it’s helpful to contextualize it within the broader trend of celebrity engagements and marriages. Historically, high-profile engagements have been as unpredictable as the weather, with varying degrees of success and public interest. Consider iconic celebrity couples like Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, whose engagement and subsequent marriage were celebrated like a royal event, only to end in a highly publicized divorce. Or take the more recent example of George and Amal Clooney, who have managed to maintain a relatively private and successful marriage despite intense media interest. Success rates in celebrity relationships are notoriously low, often due to the unique pressures of fame. Public scrutiny can be relentless, with every move dissected by fans and media alike. “The key to a successful celebrity marriage is finding that balance between public and private life,” noted a relationship counselor. Common pitfalls include maintaining privacy, balancing demanding careers, and handling constant media speculation. Leo and Vittoria will need to navigate these challenges carefully if they hope to beat the odds. Looking at past trends, the prognosis for Leo and Vittoria is cautiously optimistic. “If they can keep their relationship grounded and prioritize each other amidst their busy schedules, they stand a good chance,” predicted a celebrity relationship expert. As the world watches with bated breath, the future of Leonardo DiCaprio and Vittoria Ceretti remains unwritten. Whether they tie the knot or not, one thing is certain: their relationship will continue to captivate and intrigue fans and media alike. And who knows? Maybe, just maybe, we’ll finally see Leo walk down the aisle, proving that even in Hollywood, love can conquer all. Dating Leonardo DiCaprio, Hollywood’s perennial bachelor, could do wonders for anyone’s career—especially if that anyone is already a high-flying model like Vittoria Ceretti. Let’s break down how Vittoria’s career might evolve with Leo by her side, or more accurately, with the paparazzi constantly lurking around the corner. First off, the increased media attention is both a blessing and a curse. Suddenly, every step she takes, every move she makes (cue the Police’s “Every Breath You Take”), is headline news. “Vittoria spotted in a stunning new Dior gown—Leo nowhere in sight!” or “Is that a new handbag or just Leo’s latest gift?” You get the picture. More eyeballs mean more clicks, and more clicks mean more fame. “I didn’t even know who she was until she started dating Leo,” confessed a fashion blogger, who now tracks Vittoria’s every outfit. With all this attention, new opportunities and endorsements are practically guaranteed. Brands love a high-profile name, and what’s more high-profile than dating Leo? Expect to see Vittoria gracing even more magazine covers, landing bigger campaigns, and possibly even launching her own fashion line. “When you’re linked with a name like DiCaprio, the doors of the fashion world swing wide open,” quipped an industry insider. But it’s not all champagne and roses. The potential challenges and backlash are real. For one, the modeling world is fiercely competitive, and some might whisper that her success is riding on her boyfriend’s coattails. “It’s unfair, really,” Vittoria might lament over a glass of Pinot Grigio, “I’ve worked hard to get here.” Then there’s the inevitable paparazzi swarm. Privacy? What’s that? In the long-term, however, this relationship could solidify Vittoria’s place in the upper echelons of fashion. With the right moves, she could transition from top model to fashion mogul. After all, if the Kardashians can build an empire, why not Vittoria? Leonardo DiCaprio has always been the poster boy for Hollywood’s most eligible bachelors. His dating habits have been scrutinized, parodied, and meme-ified to no end. So, how does dating Vittoria Ceretti alter this well-established image? Firstly, there’s a shift in public perception of Leo’s dating habits. The man who seemed destined to date models perpetually under 25 is now dating someone with more depth—or so the media narrative goes. “Maybe he’s finally ready to grow up,” suggests a hopeful fan on Twitter. Others aren’t so convinced. “Just another pretty face,” comments a cynical observer, highlighting the skepticism that still surrounds his relationships. The media narratives are relentless and shape his brand significantly. Headlines like “Leo’s New Flame: More Than Just a Pretty Face?” or “Could Vittoria Be The One?” flood the tabloids. “It’s like watching a soap opera unfold in real life,” one magazine editor remarked, delighted by the constant stream of content. If Leo does decide to settle down, it could influence his career choices. Picture this: Leo, no longer the eternal bachelor, takes on more mature, grounded roles, perhaps even producing or directing. “He’s always been passionate about climate change,” noted a colleague. “Maybe this is the push he needs to focus on those projects.” Fans are divided. Some are thrilled at the prospect of seeing a more settled, serious Leo, while others mourn the end of his bachelor days. “I just can’t picture him married,” a long-time fan confessed. “It’s like the end of an era.” The media loves a good love story, especially one involving A-list celebrities. But how do tabloids and paparazzi shape public opinion, and what are the ethical implications of their coverage? Tabloids and paparazzi are relentless, shaping public opinion with every snap and headline. “Leo and Vittoria spotted in a heated argument—trouble in paradise?” screams one tabloid, while another claims, “Wedding bells in the air!” These narratives create a rollercoaster of emotions for fans and the couple alike. “It’s exhausting,” Leo probably mutters to himself, dodging yet another camera flash. The ethics of media coverage in private lives is a hotly debated topic. Celebrities might have signed up for fame, but did they sign up for 24/7 surveillance? “There’s a fine line between public interest and invasion of privacy,” comments a media ethicist. Case studies of other celebrity couples, like Meghan and Harry or Brad and Angelina, highlight how destructive constant media scrutiny can be. Balancing public interest and personal privacy is tricky. While fans feel entitled to the latest scoop, celebrities yearn for a semblance of normalcy. “We’re just people,” Vittoria might say, echoing the sentiments of many celebrities before her. Maintaining a relationship in the public eye is no small feat. The challenges are many, but there are advantages too. The pressure of constant scrutiny and gossip is immense. “Did you hear they had a fight at Nobu?” one gossip columnist might speculate. “She looked upset—maybe it’s over?” The relentless chatter can strain even the strongest relationships. “It’s like living in a fishbowl,” Leo might confide to a friend. “There’s no escape.” But there are advantages too. Publicity can be a powerful tool for brand building. “Their combined star power is huge,” notes a PR expert. “They can leverage this for good causes, endorsements, and more.” Plus, being in the limelight means endless opportunities for exclusive events, high-profile collaborations, and more. Strategies for maintaining a healthy relationship in such circumstances are essential. “Communication is key,” advises a celebrity relationship counselor. “They need to set boundaries with the media and ensure they carve out private time together.” Other celebrities have navigated these waters with varying degrees of success. “You have to be strong and united,” shares a fellow A-lister. “Ignore the noise and focus on each other.” While the future of Leonardo DiCaprio and Vittoria Ceretti’s relationship remains uncertain, one thing is clear: their love story, played out under the watchful eyes of the world, is nothing short of captivating. Whether they end up walking down the aisle or part ways, they’ve already made their mark on the ever-fascinating tapestry of celebrity romance.  Powered by Aestetica Web Design © 2024|False|False
38|Rahul Gandhi to retain Wayanad Lok Sabha seat|Wayanad prepares for by-poll after Rahul Gandhi vacates    Updated - June 17, 2024 09:20 pm IST Published - June 17, 2024 09:07 pm IST - KALPETTA Congress leaders and brother-sister duo Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra share a hug after the announcement of Priyanka’s candidature from the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, in New Delhi on June 17, 2024.   Photo Credit: ANI Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency is preparing for a by-poll after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi decided to retain Rae Bareli. Though Mr Gandhi had expressed his anguish regarding which constituency he should abandon — Wayanad or Rae Bareli- during his recent visit in Wayanad, finally he decided to vacate Wayanad. Mr. Gandhi had won both Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh and Wayanad in the recent Lok Sabha polls. A meeting of senior leaders of the Congress part, on June 17, at Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge’s house in Delhi decided to leave the Wayanad constituency and retain Rai Beariely. It also decided to nominate his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from Wayanad. Mr. Gandhi had scripted a huge victory in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency for the second time with a margin of 3,64,422 votes over his nearest rival Annie Raja of the Communist Party of India. While Mr. Gandhi polled 6,47,445 votes, Annie Raja received 2,83,023 votes. BJP candidate K. Surendran stood in third position with 1,41,045 votes. Mr Gandhi had won the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Wayanad with a record majority of 4,31,770 votes. Now all eyes are on Ms. Priyanka Gandhi to see if she could repeat the astonishing majority scripted by Mr. Gandhi in Wayanad and who would be the LDF and NDA candidates against her. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Gandhi secured a majority of 64.8% votes while CPI’s P.P. Suneer came second with 25.2% votes. Mr. Gandhi’s performance as the MP, and the national leader of a major party won the people’s favour for the second time.

The Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency has supported the Congress party since its inception in 2009. Earlier IUML State president Panakkad Sadiqali Shihab Thangal and IUML national General Secretary P.K.

The Modern Family star's LA residence was burglarised on Saturday, but it wasn't quite night yet, police sources told TMZ. According to officials' statement, the frightening break-in happened while it was still daylight out. Fortunately, Hyland was not directly at the receiving end of the alarming development as she is said to have been out of town when the crime broke out. Despite her in-person absence, she witnessed the incident as she caught masked individuals breaking into her place after getting an alert from her home security system. Per official claims, the suspects entered Hyland's property by breaking a glass window, alerting her security system. Even though Sarah was away from her sweet abode, she reportedly contacted the police after seeing the surveillance footage on her phone, which caught two masked men walking out of her LA home's front door. Also read   Kanye West's $39m Malibu mansion, which was ‘left to rot,’ finally finds a buyer However, the burglars were long before the cops arrived. Sources told the outlet that the place was as silent as ever by the time law-enforcement officials turned up. Police have yet to arrest any suspect under the ongoing active investigation. As the cops await Hyland's return, it remains unclear if anything valuable was looted from her crib. Sarah would have to conduct an inventory to cross-check possibly missing items and their worth. She's the latest victim to the long list of LA-based robberies this year after stars like Marlon Wayans and Bhad Bhabie's abodes suffered a similar fate. The Modern Family alum purchased the Los Angeles place before marrying The Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams. She reportedly spent $3.92 million to bag the modern farmhouse property in Studio City, California.

58|In the seven days after President Biden stepped down as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Harris campaign raked in $200 million.|Harris Campaign Says It Raised $310 Million in July, More Than Double Trump’s Haul   ADVERTISEMENT In the seven days after President Biden stepped down as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Harris campaign raked in $200 million. By Theodore Schleifer Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign survived a brutal few weeks of fund-raising in July to bounce back so dramatically before the end of the month that she more than doubled the amount of money raised by former President Donald J. Trump, her campaign announced on Friday. The Harris campaign, which for the first 20 days of July was the Biden campaign, said it had raised $310 million during the month, including $200 million in just seven days after President Biden dropped out of the race. The Trump campaign and its own allies said on Thursday that they had collected $139 million in July, an enormous sum but well short of what the Harris campaign said it had brought in amid a huge burst of enthusiasm about her candidacy. The Harris campaign raised almost as much in July as the Biden campaign had raised in March, April, May and June combined. The surge in fund-raising has allowed Democrats, for the first time in months, to have a cash-on-hand advantage over Republicans. The Harris campaign said it now had $377 million in its war chest, in contrast to the $327 million that the Trump campaign has said it has. ADVERTISEMENT Neither campaign disclosed precisely how much of the money was raised or held by the campaigns themselves versus their allied party committees. Democrats’ fund-raising was said to have plummeted in the first three weeks of the month, in the aftermath of Mr. Biden’s disastrous debate, although precise figures were not known or released by the Biden campaign. But after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, the fund-raising spigot was opened wide. The $200 million that the Harris campaign said it had raised in the week after Mr. Biden ended his re-election bid was more than Mr. Biden’s haul in the first three months of the year. The Trump campaign’s own fund-raising was strong — and most likely would have far outstripped the Democrats’ had the party not changed its standard-bearer. The $139 million raised in July amounted to one of the Trump team’s strongest fund-raising months to date, just off the sum raised in May, when Mr. Trump’s supporters responded to his felony conviction with $141 million in donations. After collecting $112 million in June, donations for the Trump team ticked up in July as Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt, was formally nominated at the Republican convention in Milwaukee and picked Senator JD Vance of Ohio to be his running mate — events that surely motivated his donors and supporters. July was the second straight month in which Democrats out-raised the Trump team. In June, when Mr. Biden was still atop the ticket, his campaign raised $127 million and ended the month with $240 million on hand, all before the history-making events that would unfold over the next four weeks.

File   Photo Credit: PTI NCP (SP) leader Supriya Sule on August 3 responded to Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar's denial of reports about him travelling to Delhi in disguise to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah when he was a opposition leader in Maharashtra and said she never levelled allegations. Mr. Pawar had said he would quit politics if the reports about his Delhi visit before the NCP forged an alliance with the BJP in 2023 were proven, and if not, those raising such allegations should quit politics. ""I never made allegations against anyone. I believe in constructive politics and policy-making. All news channels quoted Ajit Pawar as claiming how he would visit Delhi in disguise under a fake name before splitting NCP, during a media interaction at Sunil Tatkare's house in the national capital,"" Ms. Sule said. She said she was shocked that Mr. Pawar had visited Delhi in disguise to meet Mr. Shah at least “ten times” when he was the opposition leader. “When news channels in Delhi asked me about Ajit Pawar’s claims, I was shocked. I raised the issue of matching facial identification with Aadhaar on the DG app in Lok Sabha during question hour. I did not name any person,” she said. Reports published in a section of the media claimed that during an informal interaction held recently, Mr. Pawar revealed he used to travel to Delhi in disguise and meet Amit Shah on the alliance between the two parties (NCP and BJP). ""I used to wear a mask and a cap during air travel while going to Delhi to attend those meetings. I had also changed my name for air travel,"" reports quoted Mr. Pawar as saying. Latching on to this claim, the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP (SP) leaders targeted Mr. Pawar. However, talking to reporters in Nashik on August 2, Mr. Pawar said he believed in “playing open politics”. ""I am an activist who works in democracy. I don't have the habit of doing politics by hiding anything. However, opponents are targeting us with fake narratives and false news,"" he said. He said his opponents have resorted to such moves as they were shattered due to the good schemes being implemented by the Mahayuti government in Maharashtra. ""The news of me going to Delhi in disguise is false. If I want to go anywhere, I will go openly. There is no need for me to be afraid of anyone. If the reports of disguise are proven, I will quit politics,"" Mr. Pawar had said. In recent Lok Sabha elections, Ms. Sule defeated her sister-in-law and Ajit Pawar's wife Sunetra Pawar from the Baramati constituency in Maharashtra.

Addressing a press conference in Patna, Mr. Paswan said he was in favour of a caste census, for which a demand is being made by the Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi, though he was also of the view that findings there of “must not be made public”. “Our party will go for an appeal requesting the Supreme court to review its recent judgement allowing sub-groups within 15% SC quota,” he said. “Creamy layer cannot be allowed in SC quota. Allowing sub-groups within SC quota will not serve the purpose of uplifting the socially marginalised segment that has been a victim of the practice of untouchability,” he added. The Hajipur MP, whose late father Ram Vilas Paswan was among the tallest Dalit leaders of the country, expressed surprise that ""the word untouchability does not even find a mention in the Supreme court judgement"". ""The majority of Scheduled Caste people, even those coming from well-to-do families and having access to education, face untouchability. Therefore, allowing sub-groups within SC is not justified,"" he said. Mr. Paswan, however, refused to comment on the stand taken by his alliance partner JD(U) over the issue, which has hailed the verdict as a “vindication” of policies of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who had years ago created the ‘Mahadalit’ category in the State. He was also asked about the demand for a caste census which has of late rocked the Parliament. ""I think we should have a caste census. But findings of the same must not be made public. The data collated should be used by the government for framing policies,"" added Mr. Paswan, without elaborating further.

There were hugs and squeals of joy as President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and family welcomed them.                                        WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States and Russia completed their biggest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history on Thursday, with Moscow releasing journalist Evan Gershkovich and fellow American Paul Whelan, along with dissidents including Vladimir Kara-Murza, in a multinational deal that set two dozen people free. Gershkovich, Whelan and Alsu Kurmasheva, a journalist with dual U.S.-Russia citizenship, arrived on American soil shortly before midnight for a joyful reunion with their families. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris also were at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to greet them and dispense hugs all around.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) President Joe Biden, left, hugs Alsu Kurmasheva at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., following her release as part of a 24-person prisoner swap between Russia and the United States, Thursday, Aug. 1, 2024. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) The trade unfolded despite relations between Washington and Moscow being at their lowest point since the Cold War after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Negotiators in backchannel talks at one point explored an exchange involving Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, but after his death in February ultimately stitched together a 24-person deal that required significant concessions from European allies, including the release of a Russian assassin, and secured freedom for a cluster of journalists, suspected spies, political prisoners and others. Biden trumpeted the exchange, by far the largest in a series of swaps with Russia, as a diplomatic feat while welcoming families of the returning Americans to the White House. But the deal, like others before it, reflected an innate imbalance: The U.S. and allies gave up Russians charged or convicted of serious crimes in exchange for Russia releasing journalists, dissidents and others imprisoned by the country’s highly politicized legal system on charges seen by the West as trumped-up. “Deals like this one come with tough calls,” Biden said. He added, “There’s nothing that matters more to me than protecting Americans at home and abroad.”  Under the deal, Russia released Gershkovich, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal who was jailed in 2023 and convicted in July of espionage charges that he and the U.S. government vehemently denied. His family said in a statement released by the newspaper that “we can’t wait to give him the biggest hug and see his sweet and brave smile up close.” The paper’s editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, called it a “joyous day.” “While we waited for this momentous day, we were determined to be as loud as we could be on Evan’s behalf. We are so grateful for all the voices that were raised when his was silent. We can finally say, in unison, ‘Welcome home, Evan,’” she wrote in a letter posted online.

(Vaughn Sterling/The Wall Street Journal via AP) Also released was Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive jailed since 2018, also on espionage charges he and Washington have denied, and Kurmasheva, a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist convicted in July of spreading false information about the Russian military, accusations her family and employer have rejected. The three flew from Maryland to Texas and landed at Joint Base San Antonio early Friday to begin medical evaluations after spending some time with their family members. If they choose, they can receive treatment the military offers to wrongfully detained Americans. The dissidents released included Kara-Murza, a Kremlin critic and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer serving 25 years on charges of treason widely seen as politically motivated, as well as multiple associates of Navalny. Freed Kremlin critics included Oleg Orlov, a veteran human rights campaigner convicted of discrediting the Russian military, and Ilya Yashin, imprisoned for criticizing the war in Ukraine. The Russian side got Vadim Krasikov, who was convicted in Germany in 2021 and sentenced to life in prison for killing a former Chechen rebel in a Berlin park two years earlier, apparently on the orders of Moscow’s security services. Throughout the negotiations, Moscow had been persistent in pressing for his release, with Putin himself raising it. President Joe Biden, center, delivers remarks on a prisoner swap with Russia from the State Dining Room of the White House, Thursday, Aug. 1, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) At the time of Navalny’s death, officials were discussing a possible exchange involving Krasikov. But with that prospect erased, senior U.S. officials, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, made a fresh push to encourage Germany to release Krasikov. In the end, a handful of the prisoners Russia released were either German nationals or dual German-Russian nationals. Russia also received two alleged sleeper agents jailed in Slovenia, as well as three men charged by federal authorities in the U.S., including Roman Seleznev, a convicted computer hacker and the son of a Russian lawmaker, and Vadim Konoshchenok, a suspected Russian intelligence operative accused of providing American-made electronics and ammunition to the Russian military. Norway returned an academic arrested on suspicions of being a Russian spy; Poland sent back a man it detained on espionage charges. “Today is a powerful example of why it’s vital to have friends in this world,” Biden said. All told, six countries released at least one prisoner and a seventh, Turkey, participated by hosting the location for the swap, in Ankara. President Joe Biden, right, hugging Miriam Butorin, center, as Elizabeth Whelan, left, looks on after he delivered remarks on a prisoner swap with Russia from the State Dining Room of the White House, Thursday, Aug. 1, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Biden placed securing the release of Americans held wrongfully overseas at the top of his foreign policy agenda for the six months before he leaves office. In an Oval Office address discussing his decision to drop his bid for a second term, Biden said, “We’re also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world.” At one point Thursday, he grabbed the hand of Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth, and said she had practically been living at the White House as the administration tried to free Paul. He then motioned for Kurmasheva’s daughter, Miriam, to come closer and took her hand, telling the room it was her 13th birthday. He asked everyone to sing “Happy Birthday” with him. She wiped tears from her eyes. The Biden administration has now brought home more than 70 Americans detained in other countries as part of deals that have required the U.S. to give up a broad array of convicted criminals, including for drug and weapons offenses. The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivize future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. government’s top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, has sought to defend the deals by saying the number of wrongfully detained Americans has actually gone down even as swaps have increased. Tucker, the Journal’s editor-in-chief, acknowledged the debate, writing, “We know the U.S. government is keenly aware, as are we, that the only way to prevent a quickening cycle of arresting innocent people as pawns in cynical geopolitical games is to remove the incentive for Russia and other nations that pursue the same detestable practice.” Though she called for a change to the dynamic, “for now,” she wrote, “we are celebrating the return of Evan.” Thursday’s swap of 24 prisoners surpassed a deal involving 14 people that was struck in 2010. In that exchange, Washington freed 10 Russians living in the U.S. as sleepers, while Moscow deported four Russians, including Sergei Skripal, a double agent working with British intelligence. He and his daughter in 2018 were nearly killed in Britain by nerve agent poisoning blamed on Russian agents. This photo combination shows, clockwise from top left: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, corporate security executive Paul Whelan, former head of Open Russia movement Andrei Pivovarov, Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, Prague-based editor for the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Tatar-Bashkir service Alsu Kurmasheva, and Lilia Chanysheva, former coordinator of regional offices of the late opposition figure Alexei Navalny. (AP Photo) Speculation had mounted for weeks that a swap was near because of a confluence of unusual developments, including a startlingly quick trial for Gershkovich, which Washington regarded as a sham. He was sentenced to 16 years in a maximum-security prison. In a trial that concluded in two days in secrecy in the same week as Gershkovich’s, Kurmasheva was convicted on charges of spreading false information about the Russian military that her family, employer and U.S. officials rejected. Also in recent days, several other figures imprisoned in Russia for speaking out against the war in Ukraine or over their work with Navalny were moved from prison to unknown locations. Gershkovich was arrested March 29, 2023, while on a reporting trip to the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. Authorities claimed, without offering any evidence, that he was gathering secret information for the U.S. The son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, he moved to Russia in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022. Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained, as was Whelan, who was detained in December 2018 after traveling to Russia for a wedding. Whelan, who was serving a 16-year prison sentence, had been excluded from prior high-profile deals involving Russia, including the April 2022 swap by Moscow of imprisoned Marine veteran Trevor Reed for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot convicted in a drug trafficking conspiracy. That December, the U.S. released notorious arms trafficker Viktor Bout in exchange for WNBA star Brittney Griner, who had been jailed on drug charges. “Paul Whelan is free. Our family is grateful to the United States government for making Paul’s freedom a reality,” his family said in a statement. On a warm and steamy night, the freed Americans lingered on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, soaking up the moment of their return to the U.S. They took selfies with family members and friends, shared hugs with Biden and Harris, and patted loved ones on the back and smothered them with kisses. At one point, Biden gave Whelan the flag pin off his own lapel. Litvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia, and Lee from Mongolia. Associated Press writers Jonathan J.

71|Years after accusing Sanjay Leela Bhansali of being physically, verbally abusive, Ranbir Kapoor revisits his ‘anger’ on Black set|Years after accusing Sanjay Leela Bhansali of being physically, verbally abusive, Ranbir Kapoor revisits his ‘anger’ on Black set  Actor Ranbir Kapoor spoke about starting out in the film industry as an assistant to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, at a time when ‘every filmmaker’ in Bollywood had expressed their desire to work with him. Ranbir said that his father, the late Rishi Kapoor, felt that he was getting too much attention, and sent him abroad to study. When Ranbir returned, he enrolled in the best ‘film school’ that he could find – Bhansali’s set. In an interview with entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, he recalled what a tough taskmaster Bhansali was, and how the experience ‘hardened’ him for the future. Ranbir went on to make his acting debut with Bhansali’s 2007 film, Saawariya. Asked about his beginnings, he said, “When I came back (to India), every director in the film industry wanted to launch me. But I was a big fan of Sanjay Leela Bhansali. I was like, ‘If every director wants to work with me, why isn’t Sanjay Leela Bhansali offering me a movie?’ Maybe he wasn’t aware of me. So, I made a resume and went and sat outside his office.” Also read – Ranbir Kapoor opens up on Animal criticism for first time, reveals people from film industry told him they were ‘disappointed’ in him Ranbir said that the filmmaker agreed to meet him the next day. “Reading my name (on the resume), he understood who I was. I told him I’m a big fan; Devdas had just released. On the first day itself, he told me that he wanted to make a film with me, so my ambition was achieved right there. But those one-and-a-half years that I spent assisting on Black was actually the biggest film school of my life.” Ranbir recalled Bhansali’s famous temper, and said that it prepared him for the future. “He was a very hard taskmaster. We were working 14-15 hours a day. There were 10 other assistants, but I wasn’t (treated like) some special kid because of who I was. I was like everybody else. He was… very short-tempered. There was a lot of anger coming our way, and I think that really hardened me. It really prepared me for anything in life.” At an event in 2021, Ranbir had accused Bhansali of being physically violent with him when they worked together on Black. “When I assisted Mr (Sanjay Leela) Bhansali (on Black), he used to really treat me as an assistant director. I used to be kneeling down for hours, he used to hit us, he used to abuse us… that only hardens you and prepares you for the world,” he said. Ranbir also told Neha Dhupia on her show that he walked out of the project, and vowed to never work with Bhansali again. “He was beating me…after a point it got so heavy and I felt so tortured that I had to quit the film at a point…I think it was like 10 or 11 months into my job and I am like ‘ listen I can’t do this, its getting to me’ I think I am too sensitive and emotional and he got to know me so well and he kind of kept poking into that… he got too much, went crazy as far as I was concerned,” he said. In a recent interview, Bhansali addressed complaints about his temper, and told India Today, “If I’m not getting what I want, even if I lose my temper, what is wrong in it? If you’re not getting a shot, and if someone is spoiling it, what will you do? People have made stories that I’m angry, that I’m badly behaved…” Despite this, Ranbir and Bhansali are set to work together on the film Love & War, which will also feature Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal.

New video shows moment would-be Trump assassin climbed onto the roof In her first network interview since the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said that the Pennsylvania rally shooting was ""unacceptable."" ""It was unacceptable,"" she said in an interview Monday with ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas. ""And it's something that shouldn't happen again."" The violent incident on Saturday, which left one rallygoer dead, marked the first time a current or former president has been wounded in an attempted assassination since Ronald Reagan in 1981. When she first learned of the shooting, Cheatle said she was shocked and concerned -- both for Trump and for the Secret Service agents who responded to the incident. ""It was obviously a situation that as a Secret Service agent, no one ever wants to occur in their career,"" she said.  'Buck stops with me' As the head of the agency, Cheatle said it's her responsibility to investigate what went wrong and make sure nothing like it can happen again. ""The buck stops with me,"" she said. ""I am the director of the Secret Service, and I need to make sure that we are performing a review and that we are giving resources to our personnel as necessary."" Cheatle responded to reports that the suspect was seen and identified as potentially suspicious before he opened fire, saying that ""a very short period of time"" passed between then and the shooting. ""I don't have all the details yet, but it was a very short period of time,"" she said. ""Seeking that person out, finding them, identifying them, and eventually neutralizing them took place in a very short period of time, and it makes it very difficult."" Cheatle also said that local authorities were tasked with securing the building where the alleged shooter fired the shots before being taken out by a Secret Service sniper, and confirmed that local police were present inside the building while the shooter was on the roof. ""In this particular instance, we did share support for that particular site and that the Secret Service was responsible for the inner perimeter,"" Cheatle said. ""And then we sought assistance from our local counterparts for the outer perimeter. There was local police in that building -- there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building."" Cheatle said she has reached out to Trump but has not yet spoken with him. In the days since the attack, Cheatle and the Secret Service have faced heightening scrutiny for failing to prevent the incident from happening, and even calls from some to resign. Cheatle said she would not resign from her role. She is expected to testify before the GOP-led House Oversight Committee next Monday, July 22. Cheatle also said there were not any snipers on the roof that were used by the shooter because it was sloped. ""So there's a number of factors that come into play on how we secure buildings, both in our perimeter and out of our perimeter,"" she said. ""At that site itself, there were actually a number of buildings in the outer perimeter. I know that we're all focused on this one particular building because of what took place there. But there are a number of buildings in that outlying area,"" Cheatle explained. ""That building in particular has a sloped roof, at its highest point. And so, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof. And so, the decision was made to secure the building, from inside,"" she said. Director says to have confidence in Secret Service Still, she said, the American people should have confidence in the Secret Service's ability to protect the president and former president. In the aftermath of the assassination attempt, she “immediately” started looking at the protective details of those under Secret Service protection. She said she reached out to the former president’s staff and attempted to contact him but hasn’t gotten through. Cheatle also pushed back on the misinformation surrounding the assassination attempt. “Secret Service is not political,” she said. “Security is not political. People's safety is not political. And that's what we're focused on as an agency.” And she reiterated, as other officials have said, that there is “no truth” to the rumors the former president’s detail asked for more resources. The decision to take out the shooter, she said, was a “split-second decision” the agent made while perched on the roof. “They have the ability to make that decision on their own. If they see that it's a threat and they did that in that instance,"" she said. ""And I applaud the fact that they made that decision and didn't have to check with anybody and thankfully neutralized the threat."""|False|False

80| The Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller investigated whether a Trump adviser was part of an Egyptian plan, proven, to funnel $10 million to the 2016 Trump campaign.|Alongside the Trump-Russia Inquiry, a Lesser-Known Look at Egyptian Influence  Trump’s Legal Troubles ADVERTISEMENT  The Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller investigated whether a Trump adviser was part of an Egyptian plan, never proven, to funnel $10 million to the 2016 Trump campaign. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Michael S. SchmidtAdam Goldman and Glenn Thrush In the summer of 2017, as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was starting his investigation, his agents and prosecutors were chasing potentially explosive allegations about foreign influence over Donald J. Trump and his campaign. C.I.A. intelligence relayed to the special counsel’s office suggested that senior leaders of a foreign power had signed off on secretly funneling millions of dollars — with the help of a Trump campaign adviser acting as “a bag man” — to Mr. Trump in the final days of the 2016 election. Interviews and other evidence obtained by the special counsel’s office showed that indeed Mr. Trump had lent his campaign a similar amount of money in the final days of the race — and, after beating Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump immediately struck a far more favorable tone toward the country than his predecessors. The country in question, however, was not Russia. It was Egypt. Seven years after Mr. Mueller’s team dug in on those allegations, people familiar with the investigation acknowledged that while much of the country’s attention was focused on ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, the most concrete lead Mr. Mueller’s team initially had about potential foreign influence over Mr. Trump involved Egypt. The people familiar with the inquiry discussed details of it on the condition of anonymity. ADVERTISEMENT While Mr. Mueller has often been criticized for not moving aggressively enough to investigate Mr. Trump’s personal and financial ties to Russia, his team took invasive steps to try to understand whether Mr. Trump or his campaign had received financial backing from Cairo. Mr. Trump’s foreign business ties and efforts by foreign interests and government to influence him have come under scrutiny again as he seeks to return to the White House. The little-known investigation into possible Egyptian influence shows both the intensity of past efforts to explore the issue and how they have fueled Mr. Trump’s long-running assertions that he has been subject to a “witch hunt.” Case Tracker: Trump is facing multiple criminal cases related to his business and political activities.

Trump on Trial Newsletter: Sign up here to get the latest news and analysis on the cases in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C. The Egypt investigation would outlast Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, which shut down in 2019. It was picked up by career prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, who closed it out in the summer of 2020 without pursuing any charges. No evidence has ever surfaced publicly that Mr. Trump or his campaign directly received Egyptian money. Details about the depth and breadth of the investigation have trickled out over the years. CNN laid out major elements of the investigation in October 2020, including that there was a secret legal fight between the Justice Department and an Egyptian bank. Investigators at the time were seeking bank records related to the matter, which ultimately ended up — under seal — being appealed to the Supreme Court. The Washington Post on Friday disclosed further details, reporting that five days before Mr. Trump took office in 2017 an organization linked to Egyptian intelligence withdrew $10 million in cash from a bank in Cairo — the same amount that the C.I.A. had been told was given to Mr. Trump in the final days of his campaign. The report about the withdrawal was confirmed to The New York Times by a person briefed on the investigation. ADVERTISEMENT The investigation started in the days after the 2016 election when the C.I.A. learned from a trusted confidential source that senior Egyptian leaders — including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi — had signed off on sending $10 million to Mr. Trump’s cash strapped campaign. The Egyptian leaders, investigators would be told, had in mind someone in Mr. Trump’s orbit to move the money: a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser named Walid Phares, who had frequently appeared on Fox News. Our politics reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. That includes participating in rallies and donating money to a candidate or cause. The F.B.I. opened an investigation into Mr. Phares, with investigators trying to understand whether he was “a bag man.” Mr. Trump’s first C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, was briefed on the details of the agency’s intelligence. In May 2017, Mr. Mueller was appointed special counsel after questions were raised about Mr. Trump’s attempts to interfere in F.B.I. investigations into his ties to Russia. Mr. Mueller was given a mandate to investigate Russia’s effort to influence the 2016 election and ties that four Trump campaign advisers had to Russia. What the public did not know at the time was that Mr. Mueller had also been given the job of investigating Mr. Phares and the intelligence suggesting that Egypt had sought to funnel money to Mr. Trump. ADVERTISEMENT Throughout the investigation, Mr. Mueller’s team was confronted with a range of allegations about Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. But, in the eyes of some agents and prosecutors working on Mr. Mueller’s team, the intelligence about Egypt was far firmer than anything they had related to Mr. Trump and Russia. At the time, Mr. Trump was threatening to fire Mr. Mueller, drawing a red line around his personal finances. But the evidence about Egypt allowed agents and prosecutors to convince Mr. Mueller to subpoena Mr. Trump’s bank records from the period of time during the campaign and just after the election that he might have received the money. The records were not helpful in corroborating the allegations, the people familiar with the investigation said. Some investigators wanted to continue digging, but Mr. Mueller stopped short of seeking the records from when Mr. Trump took office, leaving some investigators disappointed. Mr. Mueller’s investigators did devote significant resources to looking at Mr. Phares, who had told Trump campaign advisers that he could broker meetings between the Egyptian government and the campaign. Mr. Phares also took credit for arranging a September 2016 meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. el-Sisi, which investigators later examined. ADVERTISEMENT American intelligence agencies had learned what agents and analysts thought was potentially corroborating evidence: that there were questions atop the Egyptian government whether Mr. Phares could be trusted to deliver the money. The F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Phares on multiple occasions, learning new details such as his contacts with Egyptian intelligence officials. But despite Mr. Phares initial cooperation with the investigators, he eventually hired a lawyer and stopped talking. By 2019, Mr. Mueller’s team thought it had taken the investigation as far as it could. When Mr. Mueller’s Russia inquiry wound down, he referred the still-open Egyptian case to Justice Department prosecutors, who picked up where he left off. It was around that same time that U.S. officials learned of the $10 million bank withdrawal in Cairo by the group linked to Egyptian intelligence agencies, sparking more suspicions among investigators. In June 2020, The Times reported that the F.B.I. and special counsel’s office had investigated whether Mr. Phares had secretly worked for the Egyptian government to try to influence the incoming Trump administration. Mr. Phares declined to comment at the time and could not be reached on Friday. But that summer, prosecutors decided they had hit a wall and closed out the case. Michael S.

85|Karnataka vs Centre rice battle: FCI now allows states to procure, Congress hits out at ‘delay’|Karnataka vs Centre rice battle: FCI now allows states to procure, Congress hits out at ‘delay’  A YEAR after prohibiting states from doing so, Union Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Minister Pralhad Joshi on Thursday announced that states can now directly purchase rice from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the Open Market Sale Scheme (Domestic) without participating in the e-auction. Under this, states can buy rice for Rs 2,800 per quintal (excluding the cost of transportation). This will come as a relief especially for Congress-ruled Karnataka, which has been at loggerheads with the Centre over rice procurement for its Anna Bhagya scheme. Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh hit out at the Centre for the reversal now, saying the “irrational policy (of stopping states from procuring rice) was undertaken with the sole intention of disrupting the Karnataka government’s Anna Bhagya Scheme”. A poll promise by the Congress, which dislodged the BJP from power in Karnataka, the scheme doubled the quota of rice available to each individual entitled to grains under the National Food Security Act, from 5 kg to 10 kg per month. Ramesh said that “the vendetta-driven decision had not only deprived the people of Karnataka of an additional five kilograms of rice through the Anna Bhagya Guarantee, but also increased India’s food subsidy bill by tens of thousands of crores”. Why Karnataka wanted the rice JUST DAYS ahead of the rollout of the Anna Bhagya Scheme by the newly elected Congress government in Karnataka, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Food Distribution announced in June last year that state governments could no longer acquire rice via the open market scheme of the FCI. The Centre justified the move as anti-inflationary, “to maintain sufficient stocks for market intervention / control (of) prices of wheat and rice”. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, however, said the decision was meant to specifically stymie his government, which was banking on FCI supply to meet its Anna Bhagya promise. The scheme had been one of the Congress’s “five guarantees” to voters in its manifesto, which are believed to have gone a long way in helping the party win the 2023 elections, and the party claimed that the BJP was trying to get back at it. As per Karnataka’s estimates, it needed 2.28 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of rice to facilitate 5 kg of free rice per member per BPL family over the next one year, apart from what was given under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The Karnataka scheme had identified 1.19 crore BPL card holding families for Anna Bhagya. The Central scheme recognises 96.19 lakh regular BPL card holder families, plus 10.36 lakh state BPL card holders as NFSA beneficiaries – making a total of 1.06 crore family beneficiaries. The Siddaramaiah government had therefore budgeted for Rs 890 crore per month as its expenditure for the scheme, hoping to source rice from the FCI at Rs 34 per kg (including Rs 2.60 per kg for transportation). After the Centre stopped this, the Siddaramaiah government had to resort to handing out cash amounting to Rs 170 per person to make up for the rice shortfall. These funds were deposited into the bank accounts of BPL family heads. Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates|True|True

97|Parnelli Jones, Champion Auto Racer and Record Setter, Is Dead at 90|Parnelli Jones, Champion Auto Racer and Record Setter, Is Dead at 90  ADVERTISEMENT  He was one of the greatest drivers of the 1960s and ’70s, winning six Indy races and four major NASCAR events while setting speed marks. By Richard Goldstein Parnelli Jones, who as a teenager traded in a horse for a hot rod and went on to become one of the biggest stars in auto racing and a storied figure at the Indianapolis 500, died on Tuesday in Torrance, Calif., where he had lived for many years. He was 90. His son P.J. confirmed in an interview that Jones died at Torrance Memorial Medical Center surrounded by family and friends. He had been treated for Parkinson’s disease since it was diagnosed about 10 years ago, his son said. Jones was best known for his exploits at the Indy 500 in the 1960s, when it was still the premier event in auto racing. He was the oldest surviving winner of the race. “Parnelli Jones was the greatest driver of his era,” his contemporary Mario Andretti once said. “He had aggressiveness and also a finesse that no one else possessed. And he won on everything he put his hands on.” ADVERTISEMENT Jones captured dozens of races, winning six times in Indy races and four times in NASCAR events and triumphing in off-road, sports car, sprint and midget races as well. Jones was once asked if there had ever been anyone better than him. “I don’t think so,” he told Car and Driver magazine in 2013. “You can teach somebody how to drive, but you can’t teach them that will and desire and kick-butt attitude.” How The Times decides who gets an obituary. There is no formula, scoring system or checklist in determining the news value of a life. We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here. Rufus Parnell Jones was born on Aug. 12, 1933, in Texarkana, Ark., the oldest of three children, and grew up in Torrance, south of Los Angeles, where his father, Commodore Jones, was a shipyard worker. After selling a horse he owned at age 16 and using the proceeds to buy a hot rod, Jones became fascinated by jalopy racing. He would bounce his cars off trees just for the thrill of it. “I had all this desire and no talent, and I was wrecking my car every week,” he told Investor’s Business Daily in 2013. ADVERTISEMENT At 17, he began racing jalopies at a speedway in Gardena, Calif. He passed himself off as 21, the minimum age required to drive there, by getting a fake identification card that dropped Rufus as his first name in favor of Parnellie Jones, which was painted on his racecar (spelling it then with a second “e”). “When I was a kid, there was a freckle-faced girl at school named Nellie who my friend, Billy Calder, teased me about,” Jones told Southbay Magazine, a Los Angeles County publication, in 2013. “He would yell, ‘Nellie loves Parnelli! Nellie loves Parnelli!’ That was the name that I thought of when I got the fake I.D.” Jones toured the Midwest fair circuit in the late 1950s, driving midget and sprint cars, and came to the attention of the racecar owner J.C. Agajanian, who sponsored him for Indy races. He might have won all seven of the ones he raced in if not for bad luck in his first. He was among the leaders in his first Indy 500, in 1961, but faded to 12th place after debris from a wreck cut his eyebrow and bloodied his goggles. He shared rookie of the year honors with Bobby Marshman. ADVERTISEMENT Jones won the pole for the 1962 race when he set a record average qualifying time of 150.370 miles an hour. He was leading more than halfway through the event, but a brake problem left him in seventh place. “I can remember after the ’61 rookie year and how I had a chance to win, that I couldn’t wait until next year,” he once said. “Then, after ’62, when I was leading and long gone, I couldn’t wait till the next year. I just felt like it owed me.” His victory in the 1963 race came while driving an Offenhauser-powered Watson roadster that he called Ol’ Calhoun, the nickname coming from an obscure football joke. But the win was not without controversy. Jones’s car began leaking oil while he led in the late stages. The race’s chief steward considered ordering him off the track, but the leak eventually stopped and he continued on, besting Jimmy Clark of Scotland — who driving a Lotus Ford, one of the few rear-engine cars in the race — by nearly 34 seconds. Jones averaged 143.137 miles an hour, an Indy 500 record at the time. ADVERTISEMENT The following day, the driver Eddie Sachs, who claimed that oil from Jones’s car had caused him to slide into a wall, got into an argument with him. As Jones told MotorSport magazine in 2013: “I said, ‘I oughtta bust you in the mouth.’ And he said, ‘Go ahead.’ So I let him have it.” Jones’s final Indy 500 came in 1967, when he drove Andy Granatelli’s revolutionary turbine-powered car, which was considerably faster than the traditional piston-engine cars. He was leading A.J. Foyt by more than a mile with seven and a half miles to go when a bearing, reportedly costing $6, failed in his gear box, forcing him to limp into the pits as Foyt went on to his third Indy 500 triumph. In 1971 and ’72, Jones won the off-road race that came to be known as the Baja 1000, and he captured the Sports Car Club of America’s 1970 road-racing Trans-Am Championship. He was a team owner with his business partner Vel Miletich, sponsoring Al Unser Sr. in Unser’s 1970 and ’71 Indy 500 victories. Jones’s team competed in Formula 1 from 1974 to 1976, but his best finish in that venue was fourth in the 1975 Sweden Grand Prix. In addition to his son P.J., he is survived by his wife, Judy Jones; another son, Page; and six grandchildren. ADVERTISEMENT After his racing years, Jones operated chains of tire dealerships and auto parts distributorships. At times, he showed a penchant for speed away from the pro circuit. He told how in the aftermath of his 1963 Indy 500 victory, a police officer stopped him for speeding on a Southern California freeway and asked him, “Who do you think you are, Parnelli Jones?” His 2012 autobiography, written with Bones Bourcier, a journalist, was titled, “As a Matter of Fact, I Am Parnelli Jones.” Alexandra Petri contributed reporting.

101|Elon Musk attends Netanyahu’s speech to Congress as his guest; dozens of members skip|Elon Musk attends Netanyahu’s speech to Congress as his guest, but dozens of lawmakers skip it                                                                                                                      Elon Musk made a surprise appearance in Washington Wednesday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress, attending the event as Netanyahu’s guest. Musk sat in Netanyahu’s private box in the visitors gallery above the House floor, alongside Netanyahu’s wife Sara, several Israeli soldiers and at least one former hostage of Hamas. The Tesla Motors CEO’s visit to Capitol Hill came a day after he announced on X that his satellite internet company Starlink had been activated in a Gaza hospital, with the support of Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Nine months into the Israel-Hamas war and the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Netanyahu’s speech has become a lightning rod of controversy, triggering an eruption of protests in Washington. Shortly before Netanyahu was scheduled to begin speaking, U.S. Capitol Police announced they were “deploying pepper spray” against protesters who had “started to become violent” close to the Capitol. Netanyahu scolded the protesters in his speech, calling them “Iran’s useful idiots.” “These protesters chant from river to the sea, but many don’t have a clue what river and what sea they’re talking about.” Netanyahu said. More than 30 members of Congress did not attend Netanyahu’s address, many of them skipping the event in protest of the Israeli prime minister’s approach to the Israel-Hamas war. One of Netanyahu’s most vocal opponents in Congress, however, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., did attend the speech. At several points, Tlaib held up a sign that read “War Criminal.” The clear breach of House decorum reflects the deep and painful divisions in Congress over the prime minister’s leadership. Despite the absences, the prime minister entered a crowded House floor to loud applause and cheering, shaking hands with various lawmakers on his way to the podium. “America and Israel must stand together because when we stand together something very simple happens. We win, they lose,” Netanyahu said at the opening of his remarks. The Prime Minister expressed gratitude to President Joe Biden “for his heartfelt support for Israel.” “President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years,” Netanyahu said. “I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel.” Biden and Netanyahu are scheduled to meet at the White House on Thursday. Vice President Kamala Harris did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, a conspicuous departure from tradition. The White House attributed her absence to the demands of travel. Harris will have a separate meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday. Typically, the vice president presides over joint congressional sessions, but Harris is traveling Wednesday, as the newly minted Democratic front-runner for the party’s presidential nomination. Former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also skipped the speech due to his “duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for Vice President,” a Trump campaign official told NBC News. In the vice president’s absence, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., would usually take her place as the president pro tempore of the Senate, but she did not attend Netanyahu’s address for ideological reasons, according to NBC News. Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Md., presided over Netanyahu’s joint address. “The United States relationship with the State of Israel transcends politics and partisanship,” Cardin said in a statement to NBC News. “It transcends any one Israeli government or any one U.S. administration.” Though Harris attributed her Wednesday absence to travel, many of the at least 30 lawmakers said they skipped the speech to boycott Netanyahu. Several, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said they would instead meet with families of hostages held by Hamas or attend a panel on Middle East peace and security. “Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress. On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., among the loudest critics of Netanyahu as the war carries on. Wednesday’s speech was Netanyahu’s fourth address to Congress, the last of which took place in March 2015. While the Prime Minister is on Capitol Hill, he will meet with the top four congressional lawmakers: House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

Gershkovich, 32, denied the charges and pleaded not guilty during the secretive court proceedings in Yekaterinburg, mostly held behind closed doors. His employer, the Wall Street Journal, described the verdict as a “disgraceful, sham conviction”. The trial was concluded with unusual haste, raising hopes of a prisoner swap involving the journalist, something that has long been the subject of private discussions between Russian and US officials. Footage from the courtroom showed Gershkovich, dressed in a T-shirt, watching impassively from inside a glass defendant’s box, as the judge read out the sentence of “imprisonment for a term of 16 years in a penal colony with a strict regime”. The court ordered his mobile phone and reporter’s notebook to be destroyed. Earlier on Friday, the prosecution had asked for an 18-year jail term. President Joe Biden said the US government was pushing hard for Gershkovich’s release, adding: “There is no question that Russia is wrongfully detaining Evan. Journalism is not a crime.” The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the sentence “despicable”. Gershkovich was arrested while reporting in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg last March, becoming the first US journalist since the cold war to be accused of spying in Russia. He had been held in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo prison, but was returned to Yekaterinburg for trial. The prosecutors claimed Gershkovich was collecting secret information about a military factory in the Urals involved in Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine on the orders of the CIA, a claim he, the Wall Street Journal and the US state department have dismissed as ludicrous. He had been granted official accreditation to work as a journalist by the Russian foreign ministry. “This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist,” the Wall Street Journal said in a statement released after the verdict. “We will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan’s release and to support his family. Journalism is not a crime, and we will not rest until he’s released. This must end now.” . The press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders described the sentence as “outrageous” and called for Gershkovich to be released immediately. The US embassy in Moscow said: “Regardless of what Russian authorities claim, Evan is a journalist. He did not commit any illegal actions. Russian authorities have been unable to provide evidence that he committed a crime or justification for Evan’s continued detention.” The United Nations human rights office said it had serious concerns with the sentencing. “Journalists should be able to perform their essential professional functions work in a safe environment without fear of reprisals - in line with Russia’s international human rights obligations,” it said in a statement. The trial was held behind closed doors, which is common in espionage cases. Journalists were allowed briefly into the courtroom when the hearings began last month. Gershkovich appeared with a shaved head, in line with Russian regulations. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed on Wednesday that Moscow had “irrefutable evidence” Gershkovich was involved in espionage, but gave no details. Russian authorities have made nothing public that would suggest guilt, and many see the arrest as an attempt to use jailed Americans as bargaining chips in an exchange for Russian intelligence operatives and assassins held in western jails. The speed of the case, with this week’s hearings brought forward by more than a month and the prosecution racing through witness testimony in one afternoon, may indicate that a long-discussed swap deal is close. Russia usually concludes court proceedings in such instances before a swap. Vladimir Putin, in an interview in February with the US broadcaster Tucker Carlson, said discussions on a swap were under way. “The special services are in contact with one another. They are talking … I believe an agreement can be reached,” the president said. He hinted that Russia would like to exchange Gershkovich for Vadim Krasikov, who is serving time in a German jail for assassinating a Chechen exile in Berlin in 2019.|False|False

113|"""Arjun Rampal claims honesty in relationships is a 'disease' and admits to having cheated multiple times."""|Arjun Rampal says constantly cheating on your partners is an ‘addiction’: Expert shares visible and emotional signs of potential infidelity  Actor Arjun Rampal has spoke about infidelity by describing cheating in relationships as an “addiction.”  In a recent episode of ‘The Ranveer Show Podcast,’ he is asked about open relationships and casual sex that have seemingly become more common today. Rampal stresses that even though one does not realise it, there is a “huge energy exchange” between individuals in a sexual relationship.  Segueing into the topic of non-monogamous relationships and cheating, he stated that he knows many individuals who constantly seek new partners. “It’s an addiction, it’s a habit that people created for themselves. I know a lot of people who need another woman or whatever and they are in a very happy marriage, they call it a happy marriage, I don’t know how, whatever it is, they say it’s just a fling, or nothing, but it’s not just nothing. It’s actually an addiction, it’s actually going to pull you down.” The phenomenon of serial cheating in relationships is a multifaceted issue. While monogamy is often considered the norm in many societies, the reality of repeated infidelity challenges this ideal and raises questions about human nature, commitment, and emotional needs. Gurleen Baruah, occupational psychologist and executive coach at That Culture Thing, says, “Cheating repeatedly is a serious problem, and often people don’t fully understand why it happens. Many times, deep-seated psychological issues, mismatched expectations, or unmet needs in the current relationship play a significant role.”  Here are some key psychological factors and personality traits that contribute to serial cheating in relationships: Narcissism: A personality trait characterised by an inflated sense of self-importance. Narcissists may cheat to  fulfil their need for validation and admiration from multiple sources. Impulsivity: A tendency to act on whims without considering the consequences. Impulsive individuals may engage in cheating behaviour without thinking through the potential impact. Thrill-seeking: A desire for new and exciting experiences. Serial cheaters may be drawn to the excitement and novelty of new romantic or sexual encounters. Low self-esteem: Individuals with low self-esteem may seek validation and a sense of worth from outside their primary relationship, leading to cheating behaviour. Trauma and insecure attachment: Past traumatic experiences and insecure attachment styles can contribute to a pattern of infidelity. Individuals with insecure attachment may struggle with intimacy and trust. Poor relationship health: Factors such as a lack of emotional or physical intimacy, poor communication, unresolved conflicts, and unmet expectations within a relationship can drive individuals to seek fulfilment elsewhere. According to Baruah, here are some potential indicators: -Increased Phone Use: Your partner spends more time on their phone, especially in private or at odd hours. -Lack of Engagement in Conversations: They are not tuned in during conversations, appearing distracted or disinterested. -Diverted Attention: Their attention seems consistently elsewhere, even during shared activities. -Secrecy and Isolation: They frequently seek solitude, such as spending more time alone in their room or engaging in activities without sharing details. -Avoidance: Your partner becomes distant and avoids spending quality time together. -Not Listening Fully: They may not be fully present or attentive when you’re speaking, showing a lack of interest. -Taking You for Granted: They might display a lack of appreciation or acknowledgment for your efforts and presence. -Lying and Secrecy: You catch them lying about their whereabouts or hiding their phone and online activities. -Emotional Detachment: There is a noticeable emotional distance, and they avoid deep conversations about the future or the relationship. Baruah states, “To effectively address compulsive cheating behaviour, it’s essential to start by working on yourself. Know yourself better and reflect on whether cheating is justified in your mind.” Ask yourself what cheating provides that your current relationship doesn’t. If you feel it’s not right and your life isn’t being positively affected, it’s crucial to recognise this as a problem before attempting to address it. Self reflection, open communication with your partner, psychotherapy, trauma healing, mindfulness and support groups are other strategies that can help.|True|False
114|"""Trump Media shares plummet by 30% following failed assassination attempt"""|Trump Media Stock Price Falls To Lowest Level Since Going Public  Donald Trump's media company's stock has fallen to its lowest level since it went public on March 26. Trump Media and Technology Group Corp., which owns the social media platform Truth Social, fell by 68.82 percent on Tuesday. Shares were priced at $17.89 at around midday, according to CNBC, a further drop from the previous low of $19.50 on Friday, according to Forbes. The shares were priced at $79.38 when they came on the stock market in March. The drop in the company's stock, which uses the ticker DJT, means that the former president's net worth is down by $163 million as of Tuesday, equivalent to a 4 percent drop, according to Forbes. Trump's net worth had reportedly dropped to $3.9 billion as of 4.30pm EDT on September 3, according to Forbes. The Republican presidential candidate was not alone in suffering a financial drop. Other social media companies were also affected, including Reddit, which fell by 4 percent, and Snap, which fell by 5 percent, Forbes reported. The market downturn affected all three major U.S. stock indexes, the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, and National Association of Securities Dealers (Nasdaq). Forbes reported that the drop, which mostly impacted tech companies, was triggered by a report from the Institute for Supply Management which showed that manufacturing had slowed for the fifth month in a row in August. Trump's stocks have risen and fallen over the past few months, often coinciding with the GOP nominee's political campaign. When Trump survived a failed assassination attempt on July 13, Trump Media shares experienced a surge of 30 percent at the end of the Monday after the incident, the outlet reported. This is in part because DJT trades more like a meme stock than a traditional financial investment that responds to the real value of a company, CNBC reported. As a result, the former president's net worth has decreased by $900 million since Kamala Harris joined the presidential race after Joe Biden withdrew and publicly endorsed her on July 21, according to CNN. Trump Media, which was valued at $4 billion on July 19, dropped to about $3.1 billion at the start of August, according to the outlet. The company has plans to expand its reach to live-stream TV, according to Forbes. After announcing the company would be going public, Trump joined the list of the world's 500 wealthiest people on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the first time, according to CNN.

Days later, that front is again showing cracks. First, the Adityanath government’s Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilization for Public Purposes) Bill ran into objections from the BJP’s own ranks in the Assembly, with City West, Prayagraj, MLA and former minister Sidharth Nath Singh and Prayagraj MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai expressing apprehensions over the legislation. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna even intervened while Bajpai was speaking to appeal: “Aap samajh nahi rahe ho. Pahle padh toh lo (You do not understand the Bill. First, go through it carefully).” BJP ally NISHAD Party’s Anil Tripathi then joined Singh and Bajpai in expressing his misgivings. Then, a day after the Bill cleared the Assembly, the Legislative Council sent it to a Select Committee for further scrutiny. The demand was first made by UP BJP chief and MLC Bhupendra Chaudhary, and supported by Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, who has launched a covert rebellion against Adityanath. While Adityanath in his capacity as CM is the Leader of the BJP in the Assembly, Maurya is the leader of the BJP in the Council. The BJP and allies enjoy a clear majority in both the Houses, which means that it is rare for a Bill to be sent to a Select Committee, that too on a demand made from the Treasury Benches. Nazul land is land originally acquired during the colonial period for specific purposes such as public utilities, administrative functions or for the settlement of displaced individuals. Over time, this land has been used or leased for various public and private purposes. As per the proposed Bill, Nazul land in the state will now be reserved and used exclusively for public purposes. Any court proceedings or applications requesting the transfer of ownership of Nazul land to private individuals or institutions will be cancelled and automatically rejected. In case payments have been made in anticipation of such ownership changes, the amounts are to be refunded. The government could choose to extend the leases of current leaseholders of Nazul land, provided they are in good standing, regularly paying rent, and have not violated lease terms. While BJP leaders as well as the Opposition say they have raised objections to the Bill in “public interest”, the legislation in fact replaces an ordinance that has been in implementation since March this year. The ordinance did not see any significant opposition when it was passed by the Adityanath Cabinet. On Thursday, when Chaudhary proposed that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee, even Opposition members were initially caught off-guard, not knowing how to respond. Even as the latter neither backed nor opposed Chaudhary’s proposal, other BJP leaders expressed their support for Chaudhary, with Maurya indicating it by raising his hand. The other Deputy CM, Brajesh Pathak, was seated next to Maurya in his capacity as minister. He could not vote on the proposal as he is a member of the Assembly and not the Council, but as soon as the decision was taken to send the Bill to the Select Committee, Pathak and Maurya were seen shaking hands. While the Bill saw a discussion in the Assembly on July 31, before it was passed by a voice vote, there was no discussion on it in the Upper House on August 1 before it was sent to the Select Committee. In the Assembly, noting that “governments work in continuation”, Sidharth Nath Singh suggested that those who have been residing on such land for ages and near the end of their lease should be given the opportunity to get an extension. He also suggested that with previous governments alternatively allowing freehold of the land or stopping it, those who continued to pay their instalments after freehold should also be considered. The Indian Express spoke to some members of the Legislative Council, where the Bill saw no discussion. They admitted they had not read the Bill, but added that they knew it would be recommended for Select Committee appraisal as “the public is against the provisions of the Bill”. They could not say what these provisions were. A BJP MLC said: “When the organisational head makes a proposal, we have to follow. He (Chaudhary) is not just a member of the Council but also the head of the state organisation. Even the Leader of our House and Deputy CM Keshav ji supported it. Many people have been approaching us against the provisions as it would displace poor people who have been residing on Nuzul lands for generations… The new law would have given the government the power to take it back at will.” Asked why they did not object when the ordinance was moved, the BJP MLC said he “did not know about that”. “We had to support sending it to the Select Committee, and we did.” About the surprisingly vociferous intervention by BJP MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai on the matter, Prayagraj Mahanagar BJP president Rajendra Mishra said: “Harshvardhan ji is a two-term MLA and always speaks his mind and raises his voice for the people.” He added: “Harshavardhan ji only speaks and works according to the policy and agenda of the party and government.” Bajpai is the grandson of Rajendra Kumar Bajpai, a veteran Congress leader and former Union minister who was seen as close to Indira Gandhi. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav Friday demanded the permanent withdrawal of the “inhuman” Nazul Bill. Taking a swipe at Adityanath in a post on X, Akhilesh said: “The Nazul land issue is entirely a decision to uproot homes because a bulldozer cannot run over every house… What will the BJP gain by demolishing settled homes? Will the BJP render people homeless for the benefit of land mafias?” On Thursday, soon after the Bill was sent to a Select Committee, Akhilesh said the BJP government wanted the law for “the personal benefit” of some people. “There are many such lands in Gorakhpur which some people want to grab to expand their sphere of influence… It is hoped that the Chief Minister will take suo motu cognisance and will not let any such plan succeed, especially in Gorakhpur,” he wrote on X.

A day after telling an audience of Black journalists in Chicago that Ms. Harris had “all of a sudden” decided to become “a Black person,” Mr. Trump posted a photo on his social media site of Ms. Harris dressed in a sari with a caption stating: “Your warmth, friendship, and love of your Indian Heritage are very much appreciated.” Mr. Trump also amplified posts from Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist, who had posted copies of Ms. Harris’s birth certificate and had spread false accusations that Ms. Harris has lied about her race. Ms. Harris, whose father is from Jamaica, and whose mother was Indian American, has long identified with both her Black and South Asian heritage. ADVERTISEMENT An alumna of a historically Black institution, Howard University, she responded to Mr. Trump’s comments during her speech at a convention of Black sororities on Wednesday, saying, “The American people deserve better.” Whether Mr. Trump’s initial remarks on Wednesday were planned or not, the Trump team is clearly intensifying this line of attack. “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black,” Mr. Trump told the audience of Black journalists. “So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” For a Republican Party that has acclimatized itself to a decade of combustible comments from Mr. Trump, the reaction to his latest remarks had the feeling of a familiar routine: Republicans mostly rolled their eyes in private and held their tongues in public. David Kochel, a longtime Republican strategist, called the racial identity attack unneeded and risky when, he said, Mr. Trump had a clear case against Ms. Harris on policy grounds. ADVERTISEMENT “It’s a pretty simple campaign. Why complicate with questions around race is beyond me,” Mr. Kochel said. “The campaign is to tie her to the unpopular Biden economy and prosecute the case against her on the border.” But Mr. Trump’s campaign instead leaned into his questioning of Ms. Harris’s heritage. At a rally in Harrisburg, Pa. on Wednesday night, his campaign put headlines noting her Indian American background on the big screens above the crowd. “Rally signage is the best signage!” Jason Miller, a top Trump adviser, wrote on X with the laughing emoji. As Mr. Trump’s comments ricocheted around the political world, politicians from both parties seemed to be trying to determine whether such an attack would be effective in 2024, amid a rapidly diversifying electorate. More than 12 percent of Americans identify as multiracial. The presidential election is 62 days away. Here’s our guide to the run-up to Election Day. Tracking the Polls.

Democrats denounced him as racist. “We need to fiercely call out this type of bigotry and ignorance,” Representative Maxwell Alejandro Frost of Florida wrote on X, responding to Mr. Trump’s post on Thursday of Ms. Harris in Indian garb. “During my primary race, some folks said similar things about me. That I wasn’t actually Black cause my mom is Cuban. Or that I’m not actually Latino because I’m Black.” ADVERTISEMENT The rare Republican to criticize Mr. Trump was Larry Hogan, the former Maryland governor, who is running for Senate against a Black woman, Angela Alsobrooks, the county executive of Prince George’s County, in a state where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular. Mr. Hogan denounced Mr. Trump’s comments as “unacceptable and abhorrent.” Others sought to refashion and reframe Mr. Trump’s baseless allegation, seeking safe ground through a more sanitized version. Those included Senator JD Vance, Mr. Trump’s running mate, who said at a rally on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had attended the Black journalists’ conference “because he’s running to be president for all Americans.” He attempted to recast Mr. Trump’s questions about Ms. Harris’s race as questions about her character. “Kamala Harris is a phony who caters to whatever audience is in front of her,” Mr. Vance said. Taylor Budowich, the chief executive of Make America Great Again Inc., the leading pro-Trump super PAC, echoed that view, saying, “Ms. Harris has an authenticity problem, and President Trump was right to expose it. ADVERTISEMENT “At every step of her career she has invented or reinvented herself, adopting whatever position, dialect, or story necessary to get what she wants,” Mr. Budowich said. Democrats were dubious that authenticity was the real issue. “To call someone a phony because of their race or ethnicity, that is not getting to the problem, that’s appealing to racism,” James Carville, a Democratic strategist, said. “I’m sorry, that excuse doesn’t fly.” Still, some Democrats privately said that the whole episode reminded them uncomfortably of 2016. Mr. Trump stoked controversy after controversy — dominating repeated news cycles — all summer that year before eventually defeating Hillary Clinton to win the White House. “We must stay vigilant and stay focused on the stakes in this election,” said Rahna Epting, the executive director of MoveOn, the progressive organizing group. Dennis Lennox, a Michigan-based Republican strategist, said that the episode was giving him flashbacks to his party’s struggles in 2008 to land a message against Barack Obama, who was then the Democratic presidential nominee. ADVERTISEMENT “Saying the sitting vice president of the United States, who is a Black woman, isn’t Black seems like you’re throwing everything against the wall and hoping something sticks,” he said. But Mr. Lennox was leaving open the possibility that Mr. Trump was injecting himself into what has been a 10-day period of favorable news and developments for Ms. Harris since she entered the race after President Biden bowed out and endorsed her. “Either Trump masterfully did that to stop the narrative that Kamala was building in the media, or he completely walked into the trap he’s walked into multiple times in the past,” Mr. Lennox said. “It’s an open question which one is correct.” For months, Mr. Trump has made claims that he plans to compete for a greater share of Black voters than Republicans have traditionally won. And for months Mr. Biden had struggled to excite Black voters, with polls showing him earning far less support than he had in 2020. Mr. Trump’s campaign has sought symbolic ways to signal his interest in Black voters, with his decision to agree to a question-and-answer session at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention as just the latest example. ADVERTISEMENT During the primary, he spoke at the Black Conservative Federation’s gala, where he claimed that “the Black people like me” because of his indictments in four criminal cases. And during his hush-money trial in New York, he held a rally that featured Black rappers. But the dynamics of the 2024 race have shifted since Mr. Biden stepped aside, and Mr. Trump is adjusting to the reality of running against a Black woman.

129|"""JD Vance’s Democratic opponents criticize Trump’s running mate, claiming Ohio governor lacks representation for the next generation of GOP voters."""|How Trump’s potential running mates harshly criticized him in the past        Michelle L. Price, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s hard to refer to someone as “Hitler” and end up in their good graces, let alone potentially become the person they choose to help lead the country. But Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s shifting position on Donald Trump over the years from onetime critic of the former president to staunch ally is a metamorphosis shared by many of Trump’s potential running mates. It’s not unheard of for a running mate to move beyond past disagreements with a presidential candidate. Joe Biden had a notably barbed exchange with Kamala Harris in 2020 when both were seeking the Democratic nomination. Biden picked her to be his vice president anyway. But the shift is more striking for Trump’s potential running mates, in some cases requiring them to abandon long-held policy positions and recant vehement criticism. Here’s a look at some of those shifts: In a 2016 interview with Charlie Rose while promoting his book “Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance called himself “a Never Trump guy” and said of the soon-to-be-president, “I never liked him.” He told NPR that year, “I can’t stomach Trump.” He wrote an op-ed for The New York Times titled: “Mr. Trump Is Unfit For Our Nation’s Highest Office.” Vance said he didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 and his former roommate shared images of a text message Vance sent him that year in which he called Trump “cynical” and said he could be “America’s Hitler.” But by the time Vance launched his campaign for Senate in 2021, his views were closely aligned with Trump’s. He met with the former president and quickly won his endorsement, gaining a crucial boost in the Republican primary. Vance has said he “was wrong” about Trump. In an interview this month on Fox News Channel, he was asked to explain his past criticism. “I didn’t think he was going to be a good president,” Vance said. “He was a great president. And it’s one of the reasons why I’m working so hard to make sure he gets a second term.” Some of the Florida senator’s harshest comments about Trump came as they sparred during the 2016 race. Trump started calling him “Little Marco” and mocking him. Rubio insulted Trump’s makeup and the size of his hands. Rubio called also called Trump a “con artist,” and “the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency.” This year, when ABC News played back some of Rubio’s comments from 2016, he responded by saying, “It was a campaign.” READ MORE: Who’s on Trump’s running mate shortlist and what his decision will tell us He made similar comments to CNN, saying “That is like asking a boxer why they punched somebody in the face in the third round. It’s because they were boxing.” Their relationship improved dramatically while Trump was in the White House. And as Trump has campaigned for the presidency a third time, Rubio has cheered his proposals. In the Senate, Rubio had long been a prominent voice on immigration and was a key member of a group that worked on a 2013 bill that included a path to citizenship for millions of people in the country illegally. Now, Rubio says he support’s Trump’s plan to deploy the U.S. military to deport those in the country illegally. The North Dakota governor ran against Trump this year, but dropped out in December and endorsed Trump before voting began. Before that, Burgum had rejected the idea of partnering with Trump. In an interview last July on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Burgum, a businessman, was asked if he would ever do business with Trump, and responded, “I don’t think so.” He added, “I just think that it’s important that you’re judged by the company you keep.” The next month, he told CNN in an interview that he would not serve as Trump’s vice president. Burgum this year has become an enthusiastic champion of Trump and has leveraged his profile as a wealthy businessman and governor versed in energy policy to help the Republican secure millions in fundraising, especially from high-dollar donors. When the New York congresswoman was first elected in 2014, she was known as a moderate Republican with ties to the party’s establishment. In 2016, she initially supported Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s campaign. When Trump was the party’s nominee, she didn’t say his name, only saying she would “support my party’s nominee in the fall.” She became a more vocal supporter as the election neared but made it clear she disagreed with him at times. Those disagreements faded over the years. Stefanik emerged as one of Trump’s most outspoken defenders during his first impeachment in 2019, and it’s a role she’s embraced ever since. When Republicans ousted former Rep. Liz Cheney from leadership over her criticism of Trump and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, it was Stefanik they chose to take her place. Her loyalty to Trump stood out in 2022, as the former president’s esteem within the party had deflated after he was absorbing blame for weaker-than-expected results in the midterm elections. Stefanik announced days after the election that she was endorsing Trump for president in 2024 — an announcement that came before Trump even said he was running. In 2016, the South Carolina senator initially backed Rubio in the presidential race and excoriated Trump for his reluctance to condemn the Ku Klux Klan. “If Donald Trump can’t take a stand against the KKK, we cannot trust him to stand up for America against Putin, Iran or ISIS,” said Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican. Scott still supported Trump in the 2016 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, calling him the “lesser of two evils.” Scott also criticized Trump after his comments equivocating about the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying that his “moral authority” was “compromised.” He met with Trump at the White House after. In an interview on Fox News Channel on Thursday, Scott said that he shared his perspective with the then-president in that meeting and from then on they worked to “find solutions together.” “It was the Charlottesville incident that made our relationship what it is today,” Scott said. Though he ran against Trump in the 2024 GOP primary, Scott dropped out and has become one of his most enthusiastic cheerleaders.

151|JD Vance’s Republican colleagues defend Trump’s running mate saying Ohio senator is a voice for next generation of GOP voters|JD Vance’s Republican colleagues defend Trump’s running mate saying Ohio senator is a voice for next generation of GOP voters  (CNN) — JD Vance’s Republican colleagues in the Senate say they’re largely sticking with the Ohio freshman – despite newly resurfaced comments facing criticism – warning that Vance represents where Republican see their voters moving. In the weeks since becoming Donald Trump’s chosen running mate, Vance has found himself caught in the middle of major test for a shifting Republican Party: Can a young lawmaker who represents the most populist voices in the party actually catapult Republicans to victory? Or are he and his message still a liability that could cost Trump the White House? Since he was tapped as Trump’s running mate, Vance’s stumbles and past statements – from attacks on “childless cat ladies” to proposing to raise taxes on those without children – have been billed as out of touch with the mainstream. His foreign policy positions are seen as on the fringe for old guard Republicans who have spent decades exposing the virtues of the United States’ role in the world. But most Republican senators have said they’re sticking with Vance. “There is value that comes from experience, but generations are changing. The way people look at the world and the things they know are different than the people who have been here longer,” GOP Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas said. “I think there is a time for turning the page.” Trump’s selection of Vance as his running mate set up the 40-year-old Ohio senator as the heir apparent to Trump’s brand of Republicanism that has transformed the Republican Party over the past eight years. For many in the Republican Party, Trump’s populist and isolationist impulses were often met with an eye-roll, especially during his first term when GOP lawmakers were constantly forced to comment on Trump’s latest policy stance issued via tweet. But Vance, who has been in the Senate fewer than two years, has fully embraced the populism mantle of the party, putting him at odds with many of his fellow senators -– including GOP Leader Mitch McConnell –- on issues like aid to Ukraine. “I have often said to him he is the intellectual conscience of the populist movement. In other words, he really does believe it. It’s not an opportunistic thing for him,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican. “He articulates it. He studies it. I like him because he is so communicative. Strong opinions but he also is quite eloquent. I don’t agree with him all the time – several things geopolitically – but I find him a pleasure to work with.” “He didn’t take his seat in the back of the class. That’s really clear,” Cramer said of Vance not really being a shrinking violet. Still, Vance’s stumbles since his selection and the wave of criticism over his past remarks have sparked questions – including from those inside the party – about whether his selection was the right one, especially since President Joe Biden’s dropping out has shaken up the campaign and jolted new energy into the Democratic base around Vice President Kamala Harris. “We are just hoping that Kamala Harris won’t pick someone reasonable,” said one GOP senator. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, when pushed on if Vance was the right choice, told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I’ve never been in a selection pool for VP, so I don’t necessarily – I’m not going to opine on that.” Pressed on whether Vance is a good candidate, Tillis replied, “I know JD well; I’ve gotten to know him pretty well over the past couple of years. I think he’s a smart guy. I think that … the Trump campaign picked him for a reason. I’m behind the ticket.” The ‘cat ladies’ comment comes back to haunt Vance As a Senate candidate in 2021, Vance said on Tucker Carlson’s former Fox News show that the country was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” The comments, which emerged not long after his selection as Trump’s running mate, have prompted criticism both from Hollywood celebrities as well as Republican senators. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is not supporting Trump’s bid, criticized Vance’s past comments as “offensive to me as a woman.” “Women make their own determinations as to whether or not they’re going to have children or cats or dogs or how many kids they’re going to have,” she told Raju. Even Vance allies have expressed caution about the remark. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said that Vance would make a “great vice president,” but also that he doesn’t believe Republicans should echo his now-infamous remarks. When asked by reporters Tuesday if Republicans should be mirroring Vance’s rhetoric around people who don’t have children, Hawley said, “No.” “It’s hard to have a family in America today, it’s really expensive. … So that’s what we ought to be talking about,” Hawley said. “I think we as a party should offer solutions to that.” Hawley is otherwise very supportive of Vance on the Republican ticket, saying he personally encouraged his long-time law school friend to run for the Senate years ago. A widening gulf in foreign policy For many GOP senators who have broken with Trump on his anti-NATO rhetoric, Vance’s most concerning stances deal with foreign policy, where Vance has been among the most vocal opponents of sending foreign aid to Ukraine. Vance fought against McConnell when Congress was considering a package of billions of dollars of military aid to Ukraine, which was eventually greenlit by House Speaker Mike Johnson and signed into law. During Trump’s first term, Trump’s foreign policy positions were often at odds with senior Republican senators, including the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona, former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and former Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee. But like the House, the Senate is now cast more in Trump’s mold, a transformation that’s included the election of Vance in 2022 on a campaign that included stopping military aid to Ukraine. “You’re going to see a divide among Republican senators. I think one difference is the Republican Senate in 2025 vs 2017 is going to to have a larger number of members who share President Trump’s worldview – or at least are amendable to his worldview, rather than just stridently opposed,” said Alexander Gray, who was chief of staff of the National Security Council under Trump. Gray said that Vance’s foreign policy worldview stems from his military service in Iraq and what he sees as the failures of American entanglements abroad. But he also noted that Vance supports an aggressive approach toward China and does not just want the US to retreat from the world stage altogether. “That worldview is about making hard choices with limited resources and devoting our resources to what is an existential threat with China,” Gray said. “He’s not for abdicating US global leadership; he’s not for stepping back from the US being a muscular power on the world stage.” GOP senators who back continued support to Ukraine privately say they’re hopeful that Vance might evolve as time goes on. There is a sense that as he learns more and becomes more aware of the fuller national security picture – connecting China and Iran and Russia – he will understand that the US can’t ignore Russian aggression and expect other enemies to not to respond in kind. “I don’t think anybody is going to have the option of being isolated to leave the rest of the world alone,” said one GOP senator who backs Ukraine. But Vance is hardly the only skeptic toward keeping up aid to Ukraine indefinitely inside the GOP Senate Conference, and it’s a fight that will likely play out early in a second Trump term should he win in November. Sen. Eric Schmitt, a fellow freshman from Missouri who is arguably the closest to Vance in the chamber, defended the Ohio senator, arguing that Vance was an effective spokesman for today’s Republican Party. “I think if you listen to our voters, they want the United States to be making decisions that are in the strategic best interest of the United States of America,” Schmitt said. “We can’t be everywhere all the time. I think the hubris of people advocating for a foreign policy of days gone by, we don’t have the capability to do all of those things. I don’t want to speak for him on that, but I think that is what he has talked about. He has not talked about withdrawing from the world.” Senators say they don’t have remorse Despite a series of missteps, multiple GOP senators say that Vance is learning and adapting as he goes. Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said he spoke to Trump about Vance before the vice presidential selection and it was Vance’s “energy” that attracted him to the Ohio Republican. “Energy is a big issue for him,” Mullin said of Trump. “He liked JD’s energy. He liked his way to carry a message and articulate (it). He liked that he was well known and came from a true American story completely opposite of (Trump’s) story so I think it was one of those things that he checked a lot of the boxes that Trump was looking for.” Mullin downplayed the significance of the comments that have come out of Vance’s history. “Trump had vetted him. He knew who he was, and it’s just an issue you gotta deal with everybody. Look, he’s 39 years old. I am 47. He grew up with more technology than I did,” Mullin said earlier this week, before Vance turned 40. “He grew up with more technology than I did, anybody who runs for office who is under 40, I think, is gonna have such a footprint of everything they said online. … Their personalities and their mindset changes as they get older and have kids.” Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican,  also defended Vance’s comments. “You know I have gotten in a couple of scrapes where you have to be careful how you say it. I have been here a good while and have had very few, but I know how that dynamic works,” Braun said. “I am certain that if we stick to the merits of the case, we’ll be able to overcome any of the other stuff that comes at us.” CNN’s Manu Raju contributed to this report.

153|Palestinian rivals Hamas and Fatah sign reconciliation agreement in China |Palestinian rivals Hamas and Fatah sign reconciliation agreement in China                                                                                                                      Rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah agreed to end their long-standing enmity and work to form a national unity government following talks held in China, Chinese state media reported Tuesday. “On the morning of July 23, the closing ceremony of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions was held in Beijing. Representatives of Palestinian factions signed the ‘Beijing Declaration’ on ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,” Chinese state media outlet CGTN wrote in a post on local social media platform Weibo, according to a translation provided by the website and vetted by CNBC. The “inter-Palestinian reconciliation dialogue,” as it was described by the state outlet, had been underway in Beijing since Sunday. This renewed attempt at unity marks a significant development, as Hamas and Fatah have been bitter enemies ever since the bloody 2006-2007 civil war in the Gaza Strip. Fatah, the Palestinian political party then governed both the West Bank and the Gaza enclave at the time, was violently kicked out of the latter territory, following Hamas’ election win in the Strip in 2006. Hamas has governed the Gaza enclave since then and is currently embroiled in a brutal war with Israel. The offensive was triggered by the Hamas-led terror attacks of Oct. 7, which resulted in 1,200 deaths in Israel, with a further 253 people taken hostage by Hamas into the Gaza Strip, according to Israeli tallies. The Palestinian militant group is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and U.K. In the months since, Israel’s retaliatory assaults on the Gaza Strip have killed nearly 39,000 Palestinians there, according to health authorities in the enclave. Hussam Badran, a senior Hamas official taking part in the talks, said in a statement cited by Reuters that “this declaration comes at an important time” amid Israel’s war in Gaza, and that the agreement was an “additional positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.” Fatah, formally called the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, is led by Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority (PA). The PA, and Fatah as its dominant party, govern the West Bank — a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel. Chinese state media hailed the agreement, saying it was signed by 14 Palestinian factions, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called it a “historic moment for the cause of Palestine’s liberation.” But this is far from the first time that Hamas and Fatah have signed reconciliation pacts, only to return to hostilities due to persisting disagreements. “Before everyone gets excited and files a batch of stories about China as the Middle East’s new diplomatic power: a reminder that, since 2006, Hamas and Fatah also signed reconciliation agreements in Algiers, Cairo, Doha, Mecca and Sana’a, none of which actually reconciled them,” Gregg Carlstrom, author of the book “How Long Will Israel Survive? The Threat From Within,” wrote in a post on X. While statements following the talks highlighted the signatories’ consensus on building an interim unity government that would be established with China’s support, long-time observers of the region noted that meetings and declarations will not determine success for the diplomatic efforts. “Since 2007, there have been numerous rounds of negotiation and even provisional agreements aimed at reconciliation but they have all failed,” Taufiq Rahim, principal at 2040 Advisory and author of “Middle East in Crisis & Conflict: A Primer,” told CNBC. “The devil is not in the details but the implementation,” he said. “Given the many uncertainties on the ground and the upcoming US elections the deal could be upended easily.” China has increasingly moved to expand its role in international diplomacy, making world headlines in March of 2023 when it helped broker a historic normalization agreement between then-adversaries Iran and Saudi Arabia.

155|Psilocybin temporarily dissolves brain networks|"Psilocybin generates psychedelic experience by disrupting brain network      Search Study advances efforts to harness drug's mind-altering power to treat mental illness by Tamara Schneider•July 17, 2024 This heat map of brain activity patterns shows profound disturbance during an individual’s experience after taking psilocybin. Relatively stable patterns before and after the dose (blue and green hues) are temporarily scrambled during the ""trip"" (red, orange and yellow hues). Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis report that psilocybin destabilizes a critical network of brain areas involved in introspective thinking. The findings provide a neurobiological explanation for the drug’s mind-bending effects. People who consume psilocybin-containing mushrooms — otherwise known as magic mushrooms — typically undergo a surreal experience in which their sense of space, time and self is distorted. Advocates have long argued that, under the right conditions, psychedelic experiences can alleviate mental distress, and a smattering of scientific studies suggests they may be right. Understanding precisely how the drug affects the brain will help scientists and doctors harness its therapeutic potential. In a new study, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis report that psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, temporarily scrambles a critical network of brain areas involved in introspective thinking such as daydreaming and remembering. The findings provide a neurobiological explanation for the drug’s mind-bending effects and lay some of the groundwork for the development of psilocybin-based therapies for mental illnesses such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. “There’s a massive effect initially, and when it’s gone, a pinpoint effect remains,” said co-senior author Nico U. F. Dosenbach, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology. “That’s exactly what you’d want to see for a potential medicine. You wouldn’t want people’s brain networks to be obliterated for days, but you also wouldn’t want everything to snap back to the way it was immediately. You want an effect that lasts long enough to make a difference.” The study, available July 17 in Nature, creates a road map other scientists can follow to evaluate the effects of psychoactive drugs on brain function, potentially accelerating drug development efforts for any number of psychiatric illnesses. Psilocybin showed promise as a treatment for depression in the 1950s and ‘60s, but restrictive federal drug policy in subsequent decades quashed nearly all further research. In recent years, though, regulations have loosened, and interest in the field has been revived. “These days, we know a lot about the psychological effects and the molecular/cellular effects of psilocybin,” said first author Joshua S. Siegel, MD, PhD, an instructor in psychiatry. “But we don’t know much about what happens at the level that connects the two — the level of functional brain networks.” To fill that gap, Siegel pulled together a team including Dosenbach, who is an expert in brain imaging, and co-senior author Ginger E. Nicol, MD, an associate professor of psychiatry who has experience running clinical trials with controlled substances. Together, they devised a way to visualize the impact of psilocybin on individual participants’ functional brain networks – neural communication pathways that connect different brain regions – and to correlate changes in these networks with subjective experiences. The team recruited seven healthy adults to take a high dose of psilocybin or methylphenidate, the generic form of Ritalin, under controlled conditions. Because psychedelic trips carry the risk of users having negative or scary experiences, a pair of trained experts stayed with each participant throughout the experience. The experts helped prepare the participants for what they were likely to experience, provided guidance and support during each experiment, and helped the volunteers process what had occurred afterward. Each participant underwent an average of 18 functional MRI brain scans in the days to weeks before, during and up to three weeks after their experiences with psilocybin. Four participants returned six months later to repeat the experiment. Psilocybin caused profound and widespread — yet not permanent — changes to the brain’s functional networks. In particular, it desynchronized the default mode network, an interconnected set of brain areas that, ordinarily, are simultaneously active when the brain is not working on anything in particular. After falling out of sync, the network re-established itself when the acute effects of the drug wore off, but small differences from pre-psilocybin scans persisted for weeks. The default mode network remained stable in people who received methylphenidate. “The idea is that you’re taking this system that’s fundamental to the brain’s ability to think about the self in relation to the world, and you’re totally desynchronizing it temporarily,” Siegel said. “In the short term, this creates a psychedelic experience. The longer-term consequence is that it makes the brain more flexible and potentially more able to come into a healthier state.” Normally, each individual’s functional brain network is as distinctive as a fingerprint. Psilocybin distorted brain networks so thoroughly that individuals could no longer be identified until the acute affects wore off. “The brains of people on psilocybin look more similar to each other than to their untripping selves,” Dosenbach said. “Their individuality is temporarily wiped out. This verifies, at a neuroscientific level, what people say about losing their sense of self during a trip.” During the experience, participants were asked to rate their feelings of transcendence, connectedness and awe using the validated Mystical Experience Questionnaire. The magnitude of the changes to the functional networks tracked with the intensity of each participant’s subjective experience. “We were able to get very precise data on the effects of the drug in each individual,” Nicol said. “This is a step toward precision clinical trials. In psychiatry, we often don’t know who should get a particular medicine and how much or how often. As a result, we end up prescribing one medicine after another, tinkering with the dosage, until we find something that works. By using this approach in clinical trials, we can identify the factors that determine who benefits and who doesn’t, and make better use of the medicines we have.” Nicol, Siegel and Dosenbach emphasize that people should not interpret their study as a reason to self-medicate with psilocybin. The drug is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for depression or any other condition, and there are risks to taking it without the supervision of trained mental health experts.

The election was called early following the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi, and took place amid heightened regional tensions and domestic discontent. Issued on: 06/07/2024 - 05:21 Modified: 06/07/2024 - 07:17  Iran's reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday won a runoff presidential election against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, the interior ministry said. Pezeshkian received more than 16 million votes and Jalili more than 13 million out of about 30 million votes cast, electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said, adding that voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent. The number of spoiled ballots was reported to be over 600,000. Pezeshkian thanked his supporters who came to vote ""with love and to help"" the country. ""We will extend the hand of friendship to everyone; we are all people of this country; we should use everyone for the progress of the country,"" he said on state television. The election, called early after the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, followed a first round marked by a historically low turnout last week. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority, had called for a higher turnout in the runoff, emphasising the importance of the election. He said the first round turnout was lower than expected, but added that it was not an act ""against the system"". The ballot comes against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme, and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy. In last week's first round, Pezeshkian, who was the only reformist allowed to stand, won the largest number of votes, around 42 percent, while Jalili came second with around 39 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority. Read more Who are the men running to become Iran's next president? Only 40 percent of Iran's 61 million eligible voters took part in the first round -- the lowest turnout in any presidential election since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The candidacy of Pezeshkian, a relative unknown until recently, has raised the hopes of Iran's reformists after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps Iran's main reformist coalition supported Pezeshkian, with endorsements by former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, a moderate. Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has called for ""constructive relations"" with Western countries to revive the nuclear deal in order to ""get Iran out of its isolation"". Jalili, 58, is Iran's former nuclear negotiator who is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance. Daily newsletter Receive essential international news every morning During his campaign, he rallied a substantial base of hardline supporters and received backing from other conservative figures. Ahead of Friday's runoff, Pezeshkian and Jalili took part in two televised debates during which they discussed the low turnout, as well as Iran's economic woes, international relations and internet restrictions. Pezeshkian vowed to ease long-standing internet restrictions and to ""fully"" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory headscarf for women, a high-profile issue since the death in police custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini.

JOHNER IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES By Claire Yuan JULY 26, 2024 AT 11:00 AM Menstruation can be messy and uncomfortable, often due to leaky pads, tampons and cups. A new alginate-based powder may solve that problem. The material, which solidifies menstrual blood by turning it into a gel mixture, could reduce leakage in period products without compromising capacity, researchers report July 10 in Matter. “Our paper is a proof of concept,” says Rogério Aparecido Bataglioli, a chemical engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. Before being used commercially, he says, the materials would need to be assessed for safety and scalability. Science News is collecting reader questions about how to navigate our planet's changing climate. What do you want to know about extreme heat and how it can lead to extreme weather events? Most menstrual pads use cellulose-based materials to absorb period blood. Though they are effective, many people who menstruate still struggle with leakage and mess. To solve this problem, the team turned to alginate, a naturally occurring substance derived from algae and seaweed. After the researchers screened a large pool of potential polysaccharides — long chains of carbohydrate molecules — that could have blood-absorbing properties, alginate excelled at absorbing and gelling blood. It also has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in pharmaceuticals, food and medical materials. To further improve the alginate’s absorption, the researchers added glycerol. They then tested the absorbency of these alginate-glycerol powders against commercial absorbents by sandwiching each between sheets of gauze. The team dripped modified pig blood through a model vagina to mimic menstruation before performing a squeeze test on the blood-soaked materials. Though both were good at absorbing the blood, when the simulated period pads with commercial absorbent were compressed, it was “like squeezing a sponge,” says Bryan Hsu, a microbiologist at Virginia Tech. With the alginate material, which gelled the blood, the pads leaked less under pressure. To assess the leakage of alginate-based menstrual pads, researchers wrapped the new material in gauze and dripped pig blood on it. They then lightly centrifuged the pads on top of well plates to mimic compression and collect the leakage. They did the same thing for three other scenarios: no added material, commercial pad fillers and polyacrylate, the industry gold-standard superabsorbent polymer. Click through the slideshow below to see how each fared. The team also tested their new material in menstrual cups. They packed the alginate-glycerol powder into a long and narrow cotton sheath that was then coiled around inside of the cup. After the blood entered the menstrual cup and encountered the alginate, it gelled. Then, the blood could be removed along with the cotton tube — and a new one could be reinserted — with minimal liquid mess. In solidifying the menstrual blood into a gel, Hsu says, the goal is to make menstrual cup removal and cleaning easier and tidier. One limitation of the study, notes ob–gyn Abigail Liberty, is that the blood was defibrinated pig blood, which does not contain fibrin, a protein involved in clotting. Though she applauds the team for using blood instead of another model fluid, menstrual blood is “different than blood that’s just floating around the body,” says Liberty, of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland (SN: 4/16/24). “It’s secreted in a different way. It’s grown, it’s released in a different way.” Due to a shortage of research on menstrual care and period products, Bataglioli and colleagues did not have a base of experimental techniques to draw from and adapt. Instead, they designed many of their methods from scratch. “That’s a message to the scientific community — there’s nothing out there,” says Zeinab Hosseinidoust, a biomedical engineer at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. “Even more important than the actual research that was done is the message that this work sends.” Questions or comments on this article?

The Spaniard recovered from a slump at the start of the second set to overcome American Tommy Paul 6-3, 7-6(7) and reach the semi-finals at the Paris Olympics, guaranteeing him the chance to play for a medal. The 21-year-old entered the match having earned three consecutive straight-sets wins in singles. The second seed was tested by the American, who beat Alcaraz in Montreal and Toronto in the past. However, as fans have become accustomed to in his electrifying early career, Alcaraz found a way in the key moments. Wearing the red and yellow colours of Spain, Alcaraz was dialled-in during the first set and then rallied from 2-5 in the second set. With Paul serving at 5-3, Alcaraz tracked down a ball deep in the forehand corner and unleashed a brutal winner on the run, raising his arm aloft and then finger to his ear after breaking Paul’s serve. His winner brought the vocal Court Philippe Chatrier crowd to their feet and they rose once again when Alcaraz saved one set point at 6/7 in the second-set tie-break when he tracked down a drop shot to flick a backhand down the line. Alcaraz then sealed victory on his second match point to become the fifth Spaniard to reach the men’s singles semi-finals since the Seoul Olympics in 1988.  Alcaraz, who struck 22 winners in his two-hour one-minute victory, will face Felix Auger-Aliassime in the semi-finals after the Canadian beat Norway's Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-7(8), 6-3. The No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings is the youngest semi-finalist in the men’s singles event since Novak Djokovic in Beijing in 2008. Alcaraz now leads Paul 4-2 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having defeated the World No. 13 en route to the title at Wimbledon last month. Alcaraz triumphed on Court Philippe Chatrier earlier this season when he clinched his maiden Roland Garros crown. He is making his Olympic debut and will have the chance to compete for a medal. If he wins his semi-final he will play for gold and if he loses he will play for bronze. Alcaraz suffered a disappointing defeat in doubles on Wednesday evening alongside countryman and legend Rafael Nadal. The Spaniards lost to Americans Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram in straight sets but Alcaraz did not let that setback deter him against Paul, with the 21-year-old digging deep to reach the semi-finals. Later on Thursday, Auger-Aliassime eventually moved past Ruud in three sets. The No. 19 player in the PIF ATP Rankings failed to convert one match point in the second-set tie-break at 6/5 but responded with an impressive display in the decider to advance. The 23-year-old struck 12 winners in the third set and did not face a break point to triumph after two hours and 49 minutes. Auger-Aliassime's best result this season came in Madrid where he reached the final.  © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

But make no mistake: Ukraine can and will stop Putin, especially with our full collective support.” The aid will include new batteries and components for Patriot missile systems, donated by the U.S., Germany, Romania, the Netherlands and other partners. Italy will donate an additional SAMP-T missile system. Speaking from a teleprompter, Biden said that more air defense supplies will be distributed to Ukraine in the coming months. The announcement comes over two years into brutal invasion of Ukraine led by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a war that has become a point of contention on Capitol Hill as lawmakers remain divided on whether to keep providing funds for Ukraine’s defense. Biden’s speech also served as the latest example of the split screen looming over the 2024 NATO summit this week: As the president holds high-stakes meetings with foreign allies, his political future in the U.S. Democratic Party is on the line. The president’s Tuesday remarks were another opportunity for him to assuage Democratic fears about his 2024 candidacy, following his disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump in June. Since then, cracks have emerged within the Democratic Party as some lawmakers, donors and strategists publicly urge Biden to bow out of the race and allow a new nominee to step forward. Earlier Tuesday, House Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., joined the growing tally of Democratic lawmakers officially calling on Biden to drop out. Others have expressed continued support for the president in public statements, while voicing their reservations behind closed doors. Even as some Democrats remain tight-lipped about their concern about the president’s electability, many have openly noted that this week’s NATO summit comes with added pressure given the looming reelection doubts. The summit presents a timely example of Democrats’ heightened anxieties about losing to Trump in November. The former president has said he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the 32-member military alliance if he won a second term. “Americans, they know we’re stronger with our friends and we understand this is a sacred obligation,” Biden said during his NATO speech. Since his June 27 debate fumble, Biden has held several public appearances to try and restore confidence in his candidacy, including a 22-minute interview with ABC News last Friday. So far, his public showings have not put Democrats’ worries to rest. “The president needs to engage in the kind of interaction with voters that will prove to those that are skeptical out there that he can do the job,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a Sunday broadcast interview about the week ahead. “If he can’t do that, then he has a decision to make.” Biden is scheduled to hold a solo press conference on Thursday evening, a highly anticipated opportunity for him to prove that he can carry on an exchange with reporters in an unscripted environment.

225|‘A kind of civil war’: Divided France on alert for unrest amid political earthquake|‘A kind of civil war’: Divided France on alert for unrest amid political earthquake                                                                                                                      “We’re scared of what might happen,” Amel, 34, told CNBC ahead of the final round of voting in France’s snap election this weekend. The vote is being closely watched by all quarters of French society to see if the nationalist, anti-immigration National Rally (RN) builds on its initial win in the first round of voting, or whether centrist and leftwing parties have been able to thwart the party’s chances of entering government. “It’s a very, very tense time. And it’s the first time that the far right is winning at the first turn [the first round of the ballot]. So it’s a very big deal,” Amel, a therapist who said she will vote for the leftwing New Popular Front, added. “We are very anxious and we are trying to get everyone to vote, trying to tell people who don’t vote to go and vote, and to try to convince people who vote for the extreme right that they are not a good answer [to France’s problems].” France’s far-right RN rejects the “extremist” label, saying it stands up for French values, culture and citizens at a time when many are fed up with France’s political establishment that’s been led by President Emmanuel Macron since 2017. But RN’s opponents and critics warn France is on the brink of a political catastrophe if an overtly anti-immigration, nationalist and euroskeptic party wins a majority in this snap election called by Macron after his party lost heavily against the hard-right in European Parliament elections in June. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has said French voters now have a “moral duty” to halt the party’s advance. For young, left-leaning voters like Amel, RN’s surge in voter polls, and the fact it won the most votes in the first round of the election last weekend, are worrying developments that make them fear for France’s societal cohesion. “I am worried about the country’s future. I think it’s getting worse and worse,” Amel, who preferred to only give her first name due to the sensitive nature of the situation, said. “It’s going be like a kind of civil war. I hope it will not reach that, but people will just not mix anymore and will be scared of each other. And this is very scary.” The snap election has thrown the country’s political polarization into sharp relief as polls ahead of the final round of voting on Sunday imply a deeply divided nation. The first round of the election resulted in the far-right RN winning 33% of the vote, with the leftwing New Popular Front (NFP) garnering 28% and the coalition of parties supporting Macron (Ensemble, or Together) winning 20% of the vote. Since the results of the first ballot, parties on the center-right and left have gone all-out to prevent RN’s advance in the second ballot, aiming to prevent a parliamentary majority for the party at all costs. Joining forces in a so-called “Republican Front,” centrists and leftwing parties have withdrawn candidates in many constituencies where one of their candidates was better placed to beat the RN. By offering voters a starker choice and fewer options, the anti far-right front hopes that the electorate will vote for the non-RN candidate. Whether it will work remains to be seen and analysts point out that French voters might not take kindly to being directed how to vote, or who to vote for. The final result on Sunday evening — the outcome of a snap election Macron did not need to call — will show just how hard it could be to find a consensus in national politics and government going forward. How the nation will react to the result is also uncertain. France is no stranger to civil unrest given the widespread “Yellow Vest” anti-government movement of recent years, and street protests since the first round of voting on June 30. France’s Interior Ministry appears to be preparing for more trouble after Sunday’s poll, reportedly ready to deploy around 30,000 officers across France on Sunday night amid fears of violence after polls close. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin is reported to have said 5,000 police would be on duty in Paris and its surrounding areas to “ensure that the radical right and radical left do not take advantage of the situation to cause mayhem.” France’s police force has, at times, been accused of being heavy-handed with demonstrators during previous periods of unrest, firing water cannon and tear gas at “yellow vest” demonstrators in 2019.  A member of the gendarmerie, France’s military force in charge of law enforcement and public order, told CNBC that the “French elections are a mess” and that the “public divide has rarely been so flagrant in France.” “People’s opinions are becoming more and more divided and this is felt in everyday life,” the gendarme, who asked to remain anonymous due to the nature of his job, told CNBC. The officer — a father of three who’s in his 40s, and a right-leaning voter — said the polarization in French society was “very worrying, but unfortunately normal with the ‘diversity’ of our society.” “More and more people with different values and educations are being forced to co-exist, and this clearly doesn’t work,” the officer, who works in Bordeaux in southwestern France, said. “I am worried about the country’s future, because we are too generous to people who aren’t willing to integrate and contribute to our society, this can not last.” The police officer said he expected civil unrest after the vote, whichever party gained the most votes. “There will be civil unrest whoever is elected, this is France and the people speak their mind.” Political experts agree that the current febrile atmosphere of French politics, and antagonism between the main bodies of voters, are the ingredients for further civil unrest. “You’ve got here all the recipe for a super-polarized political scene and that, of course, translates into civil society as a whole,” Philippe Marlière, professor of French and European politics at University College London, told CNBC. “If you’ve got only 33-34% of people voting for the far-right it means the rest is wary of that, or completely opposed to it, so that will translate on every level of politics — institutional politics, party politics, the National Assembly, but also in society. You will have a very polarized society in which younger people, ethnic minorities, women, and in particular feminists, would be very worried,” he said. Marlière did not discount the possibility of violence on the streets if a far-right party was elected to government. “We’re not there yet. But if there are very unpopular, very antagonizing and very hostile policies to some groups, there will be demonstrations on a scale that you have unrest in the street,” he said. Like other hard-right parties in Europe, the National Rally has tapped into voter insecurities regarding crime, immigration, national identity and economic insecurity. RN’s 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella has told voters he will “restore order,” curb immigration and tackle delinquency but he and party figurehead Marine Le Pen have rowed back on some of their more strident promises and rhetoric, back-pedaling over taking France out of NATO, for example, and moderating the party’s traditionally pro-Russian stance. Bardella said he would still support the sending of arms to Ukraine but not the deployment of ground troops, as Macron suggested was a possibility. It’s uncertain how many of National Rally’s policies would be enacted even if the party made it into government. The “Republican Front” also appears confident ahead of the second round of voting that its strategy to hurt the RN’s vote share is working. An opinion poll published by Ifop on July 3 suggested voters might tend toward a centrist pro-Macron or leftwing candidate rather than the RN candidate if that is the choice they are presented with on the ballot paper on Sunday. If the choice was between a far-left and far-right candidate, however, the picture was more nuanced, showing a split vote. Analysts predict that RN is less likely to be able to achieve an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, but is still likely to gather the most votes, creating a hung parliament scenario and headache for Macron and uncertainty for France’s political and economic outlook. “The political landscape is in turmoil and can’t really work any longer, at least not by the old rules,” Ipsos analyst Mathieu Doiret told CNBC Thursday. “We are in a situation so far from our traditions and political habitus that it’s very difficult to adapt to this new situation for every stakeholder.” Got a confidential news tip?

231|Delta CEO says CrowdStrike-Microsoft outage cost the airline $500 million|"Delta's CEO says the CrowdStrike outage cost the airline $500 million in 5 days  By  Jason Breslow A Delta Air Lines jet takes off at the Los Angeles International Airport in April. Ed Bastian, the airline's CEO, says the CrowdStrike outage has cost the carrier $500 million. The CEO of Delta Air Lines says the massive CrowdStrike outage that hobbled its flight operations earlier this month, leaving thousands of passengers stranded, has cost the airline as much as $500 million. The outage hit Delta harder than most of its competitors. The airline was forced to cancel more than 5,000 flights as a result of the outage, which stymied businesses worldwide when a failed software update from CrowdStrike, a major cybersecurity firm, crashed operations for millions of users running Microsoft Windows devices. Speaking on CNBC on Wednesday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the airline is now preparing for litigation as it looks to recover from the outage. “We have no choice,” Bastian said about potential action against CrowdStrike. “We’re not looking to wipe them out, but we’re looking to make certain that we get compensated however they decide to for what they cost us. Half a billion dollars in five days.” In a public letter released earlier this month, Bastian said the software outage hit on what was the “busiest travel weekend of the summer” for the airline with the nation's third largest fleet size. It caused massive disruption to Delta's crew-tracking system, a mission critical tool used to pair pilots and flight attendants with flights. During his interview with CNBC, Bastian said Delta was heavily reliant on CrowdStrike and Microsoft for its cybersecurity. “We’re by far the heaviest in the industry with both, and so we got hit the hardest in terms of the recovery capability,” he said. To help get back online, the company had to manually reset 40,000 servers, according to Bastian. He said the Atlanta-based carrier is now back up and running and over the last seven days has had less than 100 cancellations in aggregate over 30,000 flights. Still, Delta has been left to recover from both a massive financial and reputational hit. It also faces an investigation by the U.S. Department of Transportation over its response to the outage. No suit has yet been filed by Delta, but Bastian’s comments could portend the start of a wave of litigation against CrowdStrike for the outage. Delta has already hired the prominent litigator David Boies, chairman of the firm Boies Schiller Flexner, in advance of a potential lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the decision who was not authorized to speak publicly. “If you’re going to be having access, priority access to the Delta ecosystem in terms of technology, you’ve got to test the stuff. You can’t come into a mission-critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug,” Bastian told CNBC. In a statement, a spokesperson for CrowdStrike said, “We are aware of the reporting, but have no knowledge of a lawsuit and have no further comment."""|False|True

President Joe Biden's son is already facing the prospect of prison time after his conviction on felony gun charges and is now confronting a second criminal trial in the case accusing him of dodging taxes on millions of dollars in income from foreign business entities. The trial could put a spotlight on Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings that Republicans have spent years scrutinizing to accuse the Democratic president — without evidence — of corruption in connection with his son's work overseas. The potential political ramifications of the trial just weeks before the presidential election may have faded somewhat since President Biden's July decision to drop out of the 2024 race. But the president is deeply concerned with the well-being of his son, so the trial is likely to weigh heavily on him in the final months of his five-decade political career. It's unclear whether the Biden family will attend the trial, which begins Thursday with jury selection in a Los Angeles federal court. First lady Jill Biden sat in the courtroom nearly every day of Hunter Biden's trial in Delaware, flying home from France to be there only to turn around and return for an elaborate state visit at Élysée Palace. The Bidens watched some of Hunter's darkest moments relived in public during that trial, which ended with his conviction on three felony gun charges in June. The tax case could air more salacious evidence about what prosecutors say was lavish spending on things like escorts, drugs and exotic cars in the years Hunter Biden is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.  President Biden, for his part, has said he will not pardon his son nor commute any sentence. But the 81-year-old made those pledges while he was still actively campaigning. It's not clear whether his mindset has changed now that he has only a few more months in the White House. Neither trial was supposed to happen in the first place. Hunter Biden had agreed last year to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax charges in a deal with special counsel David Weiss, the Delaware U.S. attorney who began investigating him during President Donald Trump's administration. Under the deal, Hunter Biden could have avoided prosecution in the gun case if he stayed out of trouble for two years. But the deal blew up after the Delaware judge raised concerns about unusual aspects of it, and Weiss subsequently indicted him on the gun charges in Delaware and tax charges in California. The gun case resurfaced tawdry and embarrassing details surrounding Hunter Biden's spiral into a crack cocaine addiction before becoming sober in 2019. Jurors saw personal text messages and photos of Hunter Biden with drug paraphernalia or partially clothed as prosecutors worked to convince them that he lied when he swore on a federal form to buy a gun in 2018 that he wasn't a drug user. It took just about three hours of deliberations for jurors to find him guilty on all three counts. The first lady clutched Hunter Biden's hand as they strode from the courthouse, got into the waiting SUVs and drove off. Weiss' team has not yet said whether it will seek prison time when Hunter is sentenced in that case on Nov. 13 — the week after the election. The charges call for up to 25 years in prison, though as a first-time offender he would likely receive far less or potentially no prison time at all. President Biden stayed away from the courthouse during the Delaware trial and said little about the case while it was ongoing to avoid the appearance that he was interfering in a criminal matter brought by his own Justice Department. Shortly after Hunter's conviction, the president and first lady issued a statement expressing love for their son and pride in his addiction recovery. Hours later, the president landed in Wilmington to spend the night at his Delaware home and embraced Hunter, who was waiting for him on the tarmac. Hunter has remained by his father's side in the months since the gun trial. He and other relatives watched from the Oval Office as the president gave his address to the nation explaining why he decided to quit the presidential race. And he joined his father on stage last month at the Democratic National Convention after the president's speech endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris. The tax indictment brought last year details what prosecutors allege was a four-year scheme to avoid paying taxes while spending wildly on things like drugs, strippers and luxury hotels. The back taxes have since been paid. Hunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they will make the case that he did not act “willfully,” or with the intention to break the law, arguing that alcohol and drug abuse impaired his decision-making and judgment. Prosecutors have pressed the judge to allow them to tell jurors about Hunter's spending habits, including payments to people to clean up drug paraphernalia for him, so they can evaluate whether he intentionally or mistakenly listed those items as business expenses. “He’s not on trial because he hired people to clean out drug paraphernalia,” prosecutor Leo Wise said during a recent court hearing. “But then he went on and claimed it was a business expense.” It's unclear how many of the lurid details jurors will hear. U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi said he will maintain “strict control” over the presentation of potentially salacious evidence after the defense pressed the judge to keep it out of the case. “They want the character assassination,” Mark Geragos, a celebrity lawyer leading Hunter’s defense in the California case, said during the hearing last month. “They want to slime him because that is the whole purpose.” Prosecutors have also said they want to bring in evidence about Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings to prove his state of mind during the years at issue in the case. That includes testimony about a Romanian businessman who prosecutors say hired Hunter Biden and a business associate to influence the U.S. government while his father was vice president. The Romanian was under criminal investigation in his home country at the time and had hoped the U.S. government could help end his legal woes, according to prosecutors. Defense lawyers have accused prosecutors of trying to insert “politically-charged” and irrelevant details about his foreign business affairs into the trial. The judge deferred a ruling on the matter until trial but warned lawyers last month to keep focused on the tax allegations. “We’re not going to talk about any improper government conduct of any administration,"" the judge said."|False|False

Remember ladies.. our strength is our Patience and calm. If we put our minds to it nothing is unattainable...Mind over Matter.""  In the clip, the Bigg Boss 11 star showed glimpses of chunks of hair falling on her pillow after her chemo session. To avoid this pain, she wants to keep her mental health fine which is in her control, so that her physical health is 10 times better. ""I really really want to work on it, stay positive, be happy, and do all the possible things ki yeh joh meri journey hai mujhe koi mentally stress na hoh (My journey should not give me mental stress.)"" She further added, ""It is very stressful and depressing. I do not want to go through that. Mujhe usse pehle hi mere joh control mei hai mujhe uss steps lene hai (I want to take charge of what is in my control.)"" The actress further continued that physical pain would exist but she would want to be mentally stronger and do things that would reduce her stress.  She concluded, ""I know how hard it is. It is very very stressful, painful. Don't put yourself through all this. Simply buzz it off before it starts falling. That's what I am going to do. Remember you are still you and nothing is gonna change. In fact, you are more beautiful. Embrace the new version of yourself, this new truth, this new journey with every breath, cell and in every way possible. I am going to carry this bald look quite well."" Hina Khan's video had fans lauding her bravery. One of the comments read, ""Love you loads. My girl is the strongest. heal asap."" Another user wrote, ""You are very strong. May Guruji bless you and very very soon will be fine. Sending love."" Another comment read, ""With or without hair, you are looking absolutely gorgeous.

253|Haryana most-deprived Dalit groups see ‘new life’, want law for quota within quota in current session|Haryana most-deprived Dalit groups see ‘new life’, want law for quota within quota in current session  Soon after the Supreme Court order Thursday empowering states to go ahead with sub-categorisation within the Scheduled Castes for the purpose of reservations, the ‘Dalit-A Mahapanchayat Haryana’ announced that it would meet Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini to press that a legislation to enforce this be introduced in the ongoing Monsoon Session. Several Dalit groups, excluding those who work in the leather industry, have been seeking quota within the overall 20% SC quota to help them avail the benefits of reservation. The Dalit A Mahapanchayat is one of them. However, the group that works in the leather industry and enjoys a level of affluence has been opposed, saying such a measure would hurt Dalit unity. After Thursday’s order, they said they would be meeting BJP leaders to demand that the status quo be maintained on the issue in Haryana. With the Assembly polls in Haryana coming soon, both sides realise that they can put pressure on parties to concede their demands. Dalit-A Mahapanchayat president Devi Das Valmiki said: “We will hold a big rally if a quota within the SC quota for government jobs is not given before the Assembly polls.” The Dalit A Mahapanchayat also believes it has a strong case because, in March 2020, conceding the demand of Dalit groups like it, the Haryana Assembly had passed a Bill creating a quota within the SC quota for seats in the state’s higher educational institutions for a newly designated “Deprived Scheduled Castes” category. This category includes 36 communities, such as the Valmikis, Bazigars, Sansis, Dehas, Dhanaks and Saperas. The Dalit A Mahapanchayat wants a similar sub-quota now for government jobs. According to government sources, the ‘Deprived Scheduled Castes’ cover almost the entire SC category, which comprises around 11% of the state’s population. Haryana was an interested party in the case before the Supreme Court as in 1994, the then Congress government in the state led by Bhajan Lal had bifurcated the SC quota into two groups – ‘Block A’, comprising the more deprived Dalit groups, and ‘Block B’, comprising the Dalits working in the leather industry. In 2006, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had quashed the 1994 notification, citing the decision of a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the E V Chinnaiah vs State Of Andhra Pradesh And Others case. On Thursday, a seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court overruled this order. Devi Das Valmiki told The Indian Express: “The current BJP government should have implemented the quota within the SC reservation in government jobs too when it introduced one for admission in educational institutions in 2020. After the latest Supreme Court decision, it should be implemented as early as possible, without delay. The ball is now in the court of the state government.” He called the Supreme Court decision a “lifeline” for them. “From 1966 to now, no one from our community has become a Lok Sabha MP from Haryana, even as the state has two seats reserved for SCs.” Devi Das Valmiki claimed that after the 2004 apex court order, “even the graduates or postgraduates from our communities did not get enough employment in the state”. However, the president of the Hisar unit of the ‘Dr B R Ambedkar Sabha’, Raghubir Sunda, termed the Supreme Court order “unfortunate”, warning that it could have “adverse effects for SCs”. “A significant number of government posts out of the 20% set aside for SCs are lying vacant in Haryana with the remark ‘not found a suitable candidate’. The Supreme Court judgment would just increase this backlog for government jobs. More government posts for SCs will fall vacant. Even in educational institutions, the representation of SCs has decreased after the implementation of a quota within the SC quota,” Sunda claimed. He added: “When there is no caste-based census, then how can such a decision be implemented?” Independent voices within SC groups called for unity among community members in “the larger interest”. A Scheduled Caste leader who did not wish to be identified said: “This is the time for unity among SCs for upliftment of the community members. We should not fall prey to the agenda of divisive politics, and avoid any conflict on the issue.” Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates|True|True

Pezeshkian won 16,384,403 votes to defeat the ultra-conservative Saeed Jalili, who received 13,538,179 votes, on a final turnout of 49.8% – a big increase on the record low turnout of 39% recorded in the first round. In the first round, Pezeshkian came top, defeating three Conservative rivals. The turnout included more than 1m invalid votes. Pezeshkian has been an advocate of letting women choose whether to wear the hijab and ending internet restrictions that require the population to use VPN connections to avoid government censorship. He said after his victory: “The difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy and trust.” Under the slogan “For Iran”, Pezeshkian had promised to be a voice of the voiceless, saying protests must not be met with the police baton. Although some regard him as naive in high politics, a large part of his campaign was deliberately framed around his personal integrity, as well as his absence from ministerial office for the past decade. There were immediate calls from his backers to release political prisoners from jails, a symbol of the pent-up demands he may struggle to satisfy. Pezeshkian faces a minefield in trying to bring about change, and although he has said he is loyal to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he has also said he will resign if he feels he is being thwarted, and will then call on the population to withdraw from the political process. The precise powers of the president in the field of foreign policy are disputed, but Pezeshkian argued in successive, often acrimonious TV debates that he could not bring about change, including the lowering of 40% inflation, unless he could secure the lifting of some sanctions, which would require a less confrontational approach to international relations. During the campaign, he said Iran had found itself inside an economic cage as a result of its foreign policy, and needed to be more cooperative to see if sanctions could be lifted. His in effect running mate in the campaign had been the former foreign minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated the nuclear deal in 2015 that led to a lifting of sanctions before Donald Trump pulled the US out of the plan in 2018. Zarif said sanctions meant Iran had been bypassed. The stock market rose on the news of the reformist victory. Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator close to the supreme leader, had claimed Iran could thrive by building stronger economic ties away from the west. Far from Iran being a cage, he said, Iran was a sanctuary. Pezeshkian’s victory is all the more remarkable since no reformist was allowed to stand in the last presidential election in 2021, and it was thought the high tide of Iranian reformism had long passed, with many voters convinced there was no point going to the polls since a “shadow government” took all the decisions. The repression of the “women, life, freedom” protests in 2022 only added to a sense that the path to change through the ballot box was closed. Many senior reformists from the green movement as well as political prisoners inside Evin jail had called for a boycott. But after Pezeshkian topped the first round – defying the rule of Iranian politics that reformists lose if turnout is low – his campaign team grew in confidence that he could win if more voters took part in the runoff. It also became clear that supporters of the more centrist conservative Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf were not going to transfer their votes to Jalili, with whom they had sharp ideological differences. Zarif urged the abstentionists to vote, saying: “Those who did not participate in the first round, you sent your message in the first period, now you must complete your message with your presence.” Another leading Pezeshkian backer, the former communications minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi, said: “We must prove the people are the people, not those who consider themselves guardians of the people.” On Saturday evening, reformists became nervous that a sudden surge in late votes was a sign of the regime seeking to rig the result, something it has been accused of doing before. There were reports that government funds were being used to send clerics into rural villages to solidify support in Jalili heartlands. But then late on Saturday, government news channels leaked that Pezeshkian had won before the Iranian election headquarters declared him the official victor, sending his supporters into the streets of Tehran. About 5,000 had attended his final election rally in a football stadium in Tehran, suggesting his campaign might not have sparked the support he needed among abstentionists. After a quiet campaign in the capital, his jubilant supporters poured on to the streets of Tehran to celebrate a victory that few saw coming. In parliamentary elections earlier this year marked by low turnout, the conservatives trounced reformists. Ghalibaf’s authority as speaker of the parliament has, meanwhile, been weakened by his defeat in the presidential elections. The political complexion of the parliament will be one of the many obstacles facing the new president since it has the power to impeach ministers. The first round of voting on 28 June had the lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution. Iranian officials have long pointed to turnout as a symbol of the legitimacy for the country’s Shia theocracy, but Khamenei said those who stayed away from the polls had not done so due to opposition to the regime. The snap presidential election was caused by the death of Ebrahim Raisi, the incumbent, in a helicopter crash in May. Raisi had been seen as a potential successor to the 85-year-old supreme leader, and his death has thrown that succession into disarray. The decision is taken by an 88-strong body, the assembly of experts. The west will now have to make a judgment on whether to help Pezeshkian or maintain the blanket of sanctions due to the continued escalation of Iran’s nuclear programme, and its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Iran is enriching uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, but does not yet have the warheads or missile technology. It is also providing Russia with drones for use in Ukraine. Pezeshkian’s second foreign policy adviser alongside Zarif was a former ambassador to Moscow, Mehdi Sanei. The US state department said the election would not lead to any change in the US approach to Iran. The US officials pointed to the boycott of the elections by a large part of Iranian voters and wrote: “The elections in Iran were not free and fair. As a result, a significant number of Iranians chose not to participate at all.” The statement added: “We have no expectation that these elections will lead to a fundamental change in Iran’s path or greater respect for the human rights of citizens. As the candidates themselves have said, Iran’s policy is determined by the leader.”|False|False

Kerala's Cong unit chief drops hint  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was elected from two seats in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections -Wayanad in Kerala and Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh. However, he will have to relinquish one seat in the coming days. Now, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief K Sudhakaran has dropped a big hint indicating that Gandhi will likely relinquish the Wayanad seat. While addressing a public meeting on Wednesday, Sudhakaran indicated that Rahul Gandhi might retain the Raebareli seat. He said that the people of Kerala “should not be saddened” as Gandhi cannot be “expected to remain” in Wayanad. “We should not be saddened as Rahul Gandhi who is supposed to lead the nation cannot be expected to remain in Wayanad. Therefore, we should not be sad. Everyone should understand that and give all their wishes and support to him,” Sudhakaran said at the public meeting, where Gandhi was present. Rahul Gandhi, during a public meeting at Edavanna in Malappuram, said that he was in a dilemma over which seat he should relinquish. He said that whichever seat he decides to retain, both constituencies will be happy with the decision. The Congress leader said, ""I have a dilemma before me, whether I should be the MP of Wayanad or of Rae Bareli. What I will commit to you is that both Wayand and Raebareli will be happy with my decision."" According to the Representation of People Act, a candidate can contest from two Lok Sabha constituencies, but can hold only one seat at a time. As per the regulations, the candidate has two weeks to from the date of declaration of the results to decide which seat he wants to retain. The Lok Sabha election results were declared on June 4, which means that Rahul Gandhi will have to announce his final decision before June 18, next Tuesday. In the 2019 general elections, Rahul Gandhi contested from the Amethi and Wayanad seat but lost from the former. Contesting on two seats once again in the 2024 elections, Gandhi won from both Wayanad and Raebareli with a huge margin. In Wayanad, however, the victory margin was smaller than what it was in 2019."|True|True

Learn More or Try it out now. The relationship between the acute effects of psychedelics and their persisting neurobiological and psychological effects is poorly understood. Here, we tracked brain changes with longitudinal precision functional mapping in healthy adults before, during, and for up to 3 weeks after oral psilocybin and methylphenidate (17 MRI visits per participant) and again 6+ months later. Psilocybin disrupted connectivity across cortical networks and subcortical structures, producing more than 3-fold greater acute changes in functional networks than methylphenidate. These changes were driven by desynchronization of brain activity across spatial scales (area, network, whole brain). Psilocybin-driven desynchronization was observed across association cortex but strongest in the default mode network (DMN), which is connected to the anterior hippocampus and thought to create our sense of self. Performing a perceptual task reduced psilocybin-induced network changes, suggesting a neurobiological basis for grounding, connecting with physical reality during psychedelic therapy. The acute brain effects of psilocybin are consistent with distortions of space-time and the self. Psilocybin induced persistent decrease in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and cortex (and DMN in particular), lasting for weeks but normalizing after 6 months. Persistent suppression of hippocampal-DMN connectivity represents a candidate neuroanatomical and mechanistic correlate for psilocybin’s pro-plasticity and anti-depressant effects. Psychedelic drugs can reliably induce powerful changes in the perception of self, time and space via agonism of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A receptor)1,2. In clinical trials, a single high dose of psilocybin has demonstrates immediate and sustained symptom relief in depression3–8, and addiction9. Taken together, these two observations suggest that psychedelics should have distinct neurobiological signatures corresponding to acute (intoxication) and persisting (after the drug has been eliminated from the body) phases. Acute effects of psilocybin include increase in glucose metabolism in frontal and medial temporal cortex10,11. EEG and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies of acute psychedelic effects have reported decreased signal power12,13 and functional connectivity (FC) with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), and LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) broadly across the cortex. These seemingly paradoxical observations of increased metabolism and decreased signal power are not understood. Persisting effects of psychedelics include increase in the expression of genes that contribute to synaptic plasticity14,15, and increase in growth of neurites and synapses in vitro16, and in vivo17–19. Network-level correlates of persisting psilocybin effects remain unknown in humans. Rodent models have suggested that the burst of plasticity in the medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus may be key to psilocybin’s antidepressant effects16,17,20. The medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus form core part of the default mode network21 and increased cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms22. Precision functional mapping (PFM) utilizes dense repeated rsfMRI sampling23–25 to reveal the timecourses of individual-specific intervention-driven brain connectivity changes26. The PFM approach takes advantage of the high variability in brain networks across individuals and high stability within individuals24. We applied the PFM approach to detail the individual-specific acute and persistent effects of a single high dose of psilocybin (25mg). Healthy young adults received psilocybin (PSIL) and methylphenidate (MTP, generic Ritalin, dose-matched for arousal effects) on different days and underwent regular MRI sessions (~18 per participant) each before, during, between, and after the two drug doses (Fig. S1A). Dense pre-drug sampling familiarized participants with the scanner and establish baseline variability. We found that psilocybin produced changes in brain network structure that far exceeded those induced by other state changes such as treatment with methylphenidate, or an auditory-visual task. Interrogation of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal revealed that the highly conserved spatial structure of resting BOLD fluctuations was dramatically altered by psilocybin. Finally, we identified a change in hippocampal-cortical connectivity that persisted for weeks after psilocybin and had normalized by the time participants returned for additional open label psilocybin doses 6+ months later. Psilocybin acutely caused profound and widespread brain network changes (Figs. 1a, S2, S3), greater than 3x larger than the effects of methylphenidate or other manipulations (task engagement = 1.30, methylphenidate = 1.51, high head motion = 1.46, psilocybin = 4.58, between person = 4.58). To put psilocybin’s effects in perspective, it helps to consider that the differences in an individuals’ brain organization on/off drug were as large as those between different persons (Fig. 1b). Brain-wide connectivity change (Euclidian distance) was calculated across the cortex and subcortical structures and effects of condition were determined with a linear mixed effects (LME) model. a) Top: psilocybin-associated network change (LME model, t-statistic). Middle: methylphenidate-associated network stimulant. Bottom: day to day FC variability (random effect of day). b) Whole Brain network change magnitude (Euclidian distance between brain-wide connectivity matrices) reveals that psilocybin produces much larger change than methylphenidate, closer in magnitude to between person differences. Vertical bars and asterisks indicate significance (p<0.05) for post-hoc t-test between conditions. c) Change by system (resting-state network), based on individualized Infomap parcellation. Open circles represent individual subjects, bars represent average magnitude. *Disruption was significantly enriched within the default mode network based on rotation permutation testing. d) Psilocybin Network Change across the bilateral hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (same color scale as panel a). In the cortex, psilocybin-associated changes localized to association networks. To assess resting state networks (RSNs, referred to here as ‘systems’) specificity, we ran a community detection algorithm on each participant and then compared network change between system, using a rotation-based null model27. Psilocybin-associated change was greatest in the default mode networks (Fig. 1c). By contrast, network changes associated with methylphenidate consistently localized to motor and action communities (Fig. S3). Individual-specific psilocybin-induced brain changes were consistent when participants returned 6 months later for a second psilocybin dose (correlation between change maps; r=0.67) (Fig. S2). In subcortex, the largest psilocybin-associated network changes were seen in DMN-connected parts of the thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and hippocampus (Fig. 1d)21,28,29. In the hippocampus, foci of strong FC disruption were in the anterior hippocampus (MNI: −24, −22,16 and 24, −18,16). In the basal ganglia, the largest FC disruptions were seen in mediodorsal (MD) thalamus and anteromedial caudate. In the cerebellum the largest FC disruptions were seen in the DMN29. To examine the latent dimensions of variability in brain networks across participant, drug condition, and task, we performed multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) on brain networks from every session24. Dimension 1 (Dim1), the dimension which explained the largest amount of variability across the dataset, largely separated psilocybin from other scans (Fig. 2a), apart from one session where the participant (P5R) vomited 30 minutes after taking the psilocybin dose and was not re-dosed (red dots on the left of Fig. 2a). The higher score on Dim1 associated with psilocybin, corresponded to reduced segregation between default mode, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and cingulo-opercular network – systems that are normally anticorrelated 30(Figs. 2c and S5). Subtraction of average FC during psilocybin minus baseline revealed a similar pattern of FC change (Fig. S5). To determine if this reflects a common effect of psilocybin that generalized across dataset and psychedelics, we calculated Dim1 scores for extant datasets from participants receiving I.V. psilocybin31 and LSD32. Psychedelic increased Dim1 in nearly every participant in the LSD and psilocybin datasets (Fig. 2d). In the scatter plots, each point represents the functional network from a single scan, plotted in a multidimensional space based on the similarity between scans. Replication scans are represented with open circles. a) Dimensions 1 and 4 are plotted for every 15-minute scan. In the top panel, points are colored based on drug condition. In the bottom panel, points are colored based on participant identity. Dimension 1 separates psilocybin from non-drug and MTP scans in most cases. Dimension 4 separates individuals in most cases and shows a small but significant before/after effect. C) Visualization of dimension 1 weights (top 1% of edges are projected onto the brain to show the connections most effected by psilocybin). D) In additional datasets with LSD (top) and psilocybin (bottom), psychedelic causes reliable change along dimension 1. By comparison, methylphenidate produced a decrease in connectivity between regions in the sensory, motor, and auditory networks (Fig. S5b), consistent with previous reports33 and similar to the effect of caffeine25. To verify that observations in our sample (N = 7) were generalizable, we compared our study’s stimulant effects to those in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study34 (n = 487 taking stimulants). The main effect of stimulant use on FC in ABCD was consistent with methylphenidate-associated FC changes in our dataset (Fig. S5b). To investigate how psilocybin-driven network changes are influenced by task states, participants were asked to complete a simple auditory-visual matching task in the scanner. Participants performed this task with high accuracy during drug sessions (Fig. S4). Engagement in the task significantly decreased the magnitude of psilocybin-associated network disruption by 43% (change (psilocybin + rest) = 4.58; change (psilocybin + task) = 2.59; unpaired t-test, P = 0.0041; Figs. 1b & S3c), suggesting that psilocybin’s acute effects on brain networks may be context dependent. The reduction of psilocybin-driven brain changes parallels the psychological principle of ‘grounding’ – directing one’s attention on sensory perception as a means of alleviating intense or distressing thoughts or emotions – which is commonly employed in psychedelic-associated psychotherapy35. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of context-dependent effects of psilocybin on functional connectivity and fills an important gap between preclinical studies of context dependence36,37 and clinical observations38. Evoked responses during the auditory-visual matching task were largely unchanged during psilocybin, suggesting that altered neurovascular uncoupling is unlikely to account for observed FC change (Fig. S4). We observed that the normally stable spatial structure of resting fMRI fluctuations was disrupted by psilocybin, making the FC desynchronized and disorganized (see video supplement). We measured synchrony of brain signals using Normalized Global Spatial Complexity (NGSC) – a measure of spatial entropy that is independent of the number of signals39. NGSC calculates cumulative variance explained by subsequent spatiotemporal patterns (Fig. 3a). The lowest value of NGSC=0 means that the timecourse for vertex/voxel is identical. The highest value of NGSC=1 means that the timecourse for every vertex/voxel is independent – indicating maximal desynchronization (or spatial entropy). a) normalized global spatial complexity (NGSC) captures the ‘complexity’ of brain activity patterns. It is derived from the number of spatial principal components (PCs) used to explain the data. Higher entropy = less desynchronized activity. b) Whole-brain entropy (NGSC) is shown for every fMRI scan for a single participant (P6). Psilocybin scans are shown in red. At right, increases during psilocybin were present in all participants (box and whiskers indicate quartiles and 99.7th percentiles for non-drug scans, red circles indicate psilocybin) c) Entropy within functional brain areas shown similar increases. d) Spatial entropy is visualized on the cortical surface. Psilocybin-associated increase in entropy was largest in association cortices. This was replicated in LSD data (middle; using data from Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) and corresponds spatially to 5ht2A binding density (bottom; borrowed with permission from Beliveau et al., 2017). Psilocybin significantly increased NGSC (mixed effects model with individual differences and head motion as random effects, p = 9.2e-7), with levels returning to pre-drug baseline by the following session (Fig. 3b- d). The increase in NGSC was observed at whole-brain and individual brain area levels (Fig. 3c, d), with the largest increases in association cortex and minimal chance in primary cortex (Fig. 3d). Global and local desynchronization replicated in an LSD dataset (Fig. 3d)32 and the distribution of these effects closely matched PET-based maps of 5HT-2A receptor density (Fig. 3e)40. To assess if persistent neurotrophic and psychological effects of psychedelics might be reflected in network changes weeks after psilocybin, we assessed network changes 1–21 days post-psilocybin (compared to pre-drug). Whole brain network change scores were small, and not significantly different from day-to-day variability, indicating that the brain’s structure had mostly returned to baseline (Fig. S2 and S3). The anterior hippocampus forms part of the default mode network21 and atypical cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms22. The same region of the anterior hippocampus which showed strong acute FC changes with psilocybin showed persistent connectivity alterations in the three weeks post-drug period (Fig. 4a and Supplemental figure 7). This persistent suppression of FC between the anterior hippocampus and cortex was found in all participants (Fig. 4b; LME model testing change in RMS AntHippo-cortical FC with head motion as a random effect: p = 5.1e-5). a) Group network change (relative to baseline) t-maps, left hippocampus: top=acute psilocybin, bottom = persisting (2 weeks after psilocybin. b) All subjects demonstrated a weakening of anterior hippocampal-cortical FC post-psilocybin (p=5.1e-5; linear mixed effects model accounting for head motion and subject ID). c) Connectivity from an anterior hippocampus seedmap at baseline, post-psilocybin and change for an exemplar (P3). The red border on the right-most brain illustrates individual-defined default mode network. A decrease in hippocampal FC with parietal and frontal components of the DMN is seen. d) Timecourse of anterior hippocampus - DMN for all participants/scans (participant colors as in panel b). A moving average is shown in black. e) schematic of hippocampal-cortical circuits, borrowed from Zheng et al., 2021. As predicted based on typical connectivity patterns, FC between the anterior hippocampus and DMN was decreased after psilocybin (Fig. 4c- e). Timecourse visualization, after aligning psilocybin doses between subjects, suggests that connectivity is reduced for 3 weeks after psilocybin but returned to pre-drug by 6–12-month replication scans (Fig. 4d). This observation is compelling, as it localized to the anterior hippocampus, a brain region shown to demonstrate substantial synaptogenesis following psilocybin18. Reduced hippocampal-cortical FC may reflect increased flexibility of self-oriented hippocampal circuits. The synchronized patterns of co-activation in the resting brain are believed to reflect the brain’s perpetual job of modeling reality41. It follows that the stability of synchronized brain networks across day, task, methylphenidate, and arousal levels (but not between individuals), reflects the subjective stability of waking consciousness. By contrast, the much larger changes induced by psilocybin fit with participants’ subjective report of a radical change in consciousness. The large magnitude of psilocybin’s effects, in comparison to methylphenidate, suggests that observed changes are not merely a consequence of changes in arousal or a nonspecific effect of monoaminergic stimulation42. Multi-unit recording studies suggest that agonism of 5HT2A receptors by psychedelics does not uniformly increase or decrease firing of pyramidal neurons, but rather serves to desynchronize pairs or populations of neurons which co-activate under normal conditions43. We observed a parallel phenomenon at the region, and whole brain level. This may explain the paradoxical effects of psychedelic seen in PET FDG and fMRI: disruption of synchronized activity should produce a decrease in power of local fluctuations12,13, despite an increase in metabolic activity, and a loss of the brain’s segregated network structure32,44. This desynchronization of neural activity has been described as an increase in entropy or randomness of brain activity in the psychedelic state45,46 (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), and it has been hypothesized to underly the cognitive and perception changes associated with psychedelics. The dramatic departure from normal synchronized patterns of co-activation may be key not only to understanding psilocybin’s acute effects, but also its persistent neurotrophic effects. Changes in resting BOLD activity are linked to shifts in glutamate-dependent signaling during psilocybin47,48. This phenomenon, shared by ketamine and psychedelics, engages homeostatic plasticity mechanisms49 - a neurobiological response to large deviations in typical network activity patterns50–52. This response to novelty includes rapid upregulation in expression of BDNF, mTOR, EF2 and other plasticity-related immediate early genes15,48. Consistent with this notion, psilocybin produced the largest changes in the fronto-parietal and default mode network, brain systems frequently associated with neuropsychiatric disorders53. Psychedelics rapidly induce plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex and this appears to be necessary for rapid antidepressant-like effects in animal models. However, to understand the underpinnings of psychedelics’ unique effects, it is necessary to study the human brain. Advances in precision functional mapping and individual-level characterization enabled us to identify desynchronization of resting state fMRI signals and localize these changes to depression-relevant circuits. Novel methods to measure neurotrophic markers in the human brain54 will provide a critical link between mechanistic observations at the cellular, brain-systems and psychological levels. Such links will help answer fundamental questions about the diagnosis and treatment of conditions of psychiatric illness. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and procedures established by the Washington University in Saint Louis Institutional Review Board. All participants were compensated for their time. All aspects of this study were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) Internal Review Board, the Washington University Human Research Protection Office (WU HRPO), the Federal Drug Administration (IND: 202002165) and the Missouri Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) under a federal DEA schedule 1 research license and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04501653). Psilocybin was supplied by Usona Institute via Almac Clinical Services. Healthy young adults (N=7, 18–45 years) were enrolled in a randomized cross-over precision functional brain mapping study to evaluate differences in individual-level connectomics pre-, during, and post- psilocybin exposure. Participants underwent imaging during drug sessions with psilocybin (PSIL) 25mg, or methylphenidate (MTP) 40mg as well as non-drug imaging sessions. Drug condition categories were 1) before psilocybin (‘Baseline’), 2) Drug 1( methylphenidate or psilocybin), 3) between, 4) Drug2 and 5) After. A minimum of 3 non-drug imaging sessions were completed during each non-drug window: before (baseline), between and after drug sessions. The number of non-drug MRI sessions was dependent on availability of the participant, scanner and scanner support staff. Dosing day imaging sessions were conducted 60–180 minutes following drug administration during peak blood concentration55. MTP was selected as the active control condition to simulate the cardiovascular effects and physiological arousal (i.e., controlling for dopaminergic effects) associated with psilocybin (Griffiths et al., 2006). Usona Institute, a United States non-profit medical research organization, provided good manufacturing practices (GMP) psilocybin. Drug sessions were facilitated by two clinical research staff who completed an approved in-person or online facilitator training program provided by Usona Institute, as part of Usona’s phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03866174). The role of the study facilitators was to build a therapeutic alliance with the participant throughout the study, prepare them for their drug dosing days, and to observe and maintain participant safety during dosing day visits35. The pair consisted of an experienced clinician (lead clinical facilitator) and a trainee (co-facilitator).  Participants were invited to return >6 months after completing the initial cross-over study for an open label psilocybin dose (which we refer to as ‘replication protocol). This included 1–2 baseline fMRIs, a psilocybin session (identical to initial session, except for blinding), and 1–2 “after” sessions within 4 days of the dose. Healthy adults ages 18 to 45 years were recruited via campus-wide advertisement and colleague referral. Participants were enrolled from March 2021 to May 2023. Participants were required to have had at least one previous lifetime psychedelic exposure (e.g., psilocybin, mescaline, ayahuasca, LSD), but no psychedelics exposure within the past 6 months. Individuals with psychiatric illness (depression, psychosis, addiction) based on DSM-5 were excluded. Participants were scanned roughly every other day over the course of the experiment (Fig. S1). Imaging was performed at a consistent time of day to minimize diurnal effects in functional connectivity 56. Neuroimaging was performed on a Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) in the neuroimaging labs (NIL) at the Washington University Medical Center. Structural scans (T1w and T2w) were acquired for each participant at 0.9 mm isotropic resolution, with real-time motion correction. Structural scans from different sessions were averaged together for the purposes of Freesurfer segmentation and nonlinear atlas registrations. To capture high resolution images of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, we used an echo-planar imaging sequence with 2mm isotropic voxels, multi-band 6, multi-echo 5 (TEs: 14.20 ms, 38.93 ms, 63.66 ms, 88.39 ms, 113.12 ms), TR 1761ms, flip angle = 68 degrees, and in-plane acceleration57 (IPAT/grappa) = 2. This sequence acquired 72 axial slices (144mm coverage). Each resting scan included 510 frames (lasting 15:49 minutes) as well as 3 frames at the end used to provide estimate electronic noise. Every session included two rest scans, totally 30-minute resting-state fMRI, during which participants were instructed to hold still and look at a white fixation crosshair presented on a black background. Head motion was tracked in real time using Framewise Integrated Real-time MRI Monitoring software (FIRMM)58. An eye-tracking camera (EyeLink, Ottawa) was used to monitor participants for drowsiness. Participants also completed a previously validated event-related fMRI task initially designed for the purposes of modeling hemodynamic responses in the auditory, visual, and motor cortices. Two task fMRI runs were completed during a subset of imaging sessions. Task fMRI runs employed the same sequence using in resting fMRI, included 48 trials (24 congruent, 24 incongruent), and lasted a total of 410s. See supplemental methods ‘Matching task’ fMRI for details. Resting fMRI data were preprocessed using a in-house processing pipeline. Briefly, this included alignment, normalization, non-linear registration, removal of thermal noise using NORDIC59, bandpass filtering, and scrubbing at a movement threshold of 0.3mm. Tissue-based regressors were computed in volume (white matter, ventricles, extra-axial CSF)60 and applied following projection to surface. Details on rsfMRI preprocessing are provided in supplemental methods.  Surface generation and processing of functional data followed procedures similar to Glasser and colleagues 201361. For cortical regions and resting state networks, we used a surface parcellation and community assignments generated by Gordon & Laumann and colleagues27. See supplemental methods for further details on surface generation and cortical parcellation. For subcortical regions, we used a set of regions of interest (Seitzman et al., 2020) generated to achieves full coverage and optimal region homogeneity. A subcortical limbic system was defined based on neuroanatomy: amygdala, antero-medial thalamus, nucleus accumbens, anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus62. These regions were expanded to cover fill anatomical structures (e.g. anterior hippocampus)63. To generate region-wise connectivity matrices, time courses of all surface vertices or subcortical voxels within a region were averaged. Functional connectivity (FC) was then computed between each region timeseries using Fisher z-transformed Pearson correlation.  We identified canonical large-scale networks using the individual-specific network matching approach described in previously27–29. Briefly, cortical surface and subcortical volume assignemtns was derived using the graph-theory-based Infomap algorithm64. In this approach, we calculated the Pearson correlation matrix from all cortical vertices and subcortical voxels, concatenated across all a participant’s scans. Correlations between vertices within 30 mm of each other were set to zero. The Infomap algorithm was applied to each subject’s correlation matrix thresholded at a range of edge densities spanning from 0.01% to 2%. At each threshold, the algorithm returned community identities for each vertex and voxel. Communities were labeled by matching them at each threshold to a set of independent group average networks described in Gordon et al. 2016. In each individual and in the average, a “consensus” network assignment was derived by collapsing assignments across thresholds, giving each node the assignment it had at the sparsest possible threshold at which it was successfully assigned to one of the known group networks. See supplementary figure S2 and S3 for individual and group mode assignments.  Network change (‘distance’) was calculated at the vertex level to generate network change maps (Fig. 1a- d, Fig. 4) and a linear mixed effects model with wild bootstrapping65,66 was used to generate statistics on these maps. First, a distance map was generated for every scan by computing, for each vertex, the average distance between its FC seedmap and the FC seedmap for each of that subject’s baseline scans. Second, distance maps for every scan were labeled on 5 dimensions: Subject ID, MRI session, task (task/rest), drug condition (baseline, PSIL, between, MTP, after, etc.), and head motion (average framewise displacement). Distance maps and associated conditions were then used to solve a linear mixed effects model in which drug condition and task were fixed effects, and Subject ID, MRI session, and head motion were random effects. Wild bootstrapping in combination with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was employed to estimate p-values for t-statistic maps resulting from the LME model. To perform the analysis, a wild bootstrapping procedure was implemented, which involved resampling clusters or groups of observations rather than individual data points. A large number of bootstrap samples (B=1,000) were generated using the Rademacher procedure66, where the residuals were randomly inverted to disrupt any potential autocorrelation. Specifically, a Rademacher vector was generated by randomly assigning −1 or 1 values with equal probability to each observation’s residual. By element-wise multiplication of the original residuals with the Rademacher vector, bootstrap samples were created to capture the variability in the data. For each bootstrap sample, the TFCE algorithm was applied to enhance the sensitivity to clusters of significant voxels or regions while controlling for multiple comparisons. The value of the enhanced cluster statistic, derived from the bootstrap samples, was used to create a null distribution under the null hypothesis. By comparing the original observed cluster statistic with the null distribution, p-values were derived to quantify the statistical significance of the observed effect. The p-values were obtained based on the proportion of bootstrap samples that produced a maximum cluster statistic exceeding the observed cluster statistic. Significance thresholds were determined using alpha = 0.05 to control for the family-wise error rate. The combined approach of wild bootstrapping with the Rademacher procedure and TFCE provided a robust and data-driven method to generate p-values for neuroimaging data. This methodology accounted for the complex correlation structure, effectively controlled for multiple comparisons, and accommodated potential autocorrelation in the residuals through the Rademacher procedure. By incorporating these techniques, significant effects of psilocybin and other conditions were reliably identified amidst noise and spatial dependencies.  For analyses in Figs. 1b, 2, S2, S3, distance calculations were computed at the parcel level. The effects of day-to-day, drug condition (baseline, psilocybin, between, MTP, after), task, and head motion and their interactions were directly examined by calculating the distance between each functional network matrix. RMS Euclidean distance was computed between the linearized upper triangles of the parcellated FC matrix between each pair of 15-minute fMRI scans, creating a second-order ‘‘distance” matrix (Fig. S2). In this analysis, the two task sessions were concatenated to match the length of the 15-minute rest runs. Subsequently, the average distance was examined for functional network matrices that were (1) from the same individual within a single session, (2) from the same individual across days (‘‘day-to-day”), (3) from the same subject between drug and baseline (e.g. ‘‘PSIL v Base”), (4) from the same individual but different tasks (‘‘task:rest”), (5) from the same individual between highest motion scans and baseline (“hi:lo motion”), (6) from different individuals (“between person”). Post-hoc comparison between drug conditions was conducted using two-tailed t tests. A related approach using z-transformed Pearson correlation (‘similarity’ rather than distance) was also taken and results were unchanged (Fig. S2c).  The different conditions above were compared by calculating whole brain network change magnitudes as shown in Figs. 1b, S2, and S3c. These are reported in the text as normalized network change scores calculated using the following procedure: We (i) determined network change for each condition compared to baseline as described above, (ii) subtracted within-session distance for all conditions (such that within-session network change = 0), (iii) divided all conditions by day-to-day distance (such that day-to-day network change = 1). Thus, normalized whole brain network change values (e.g. PSIL v Base = 4.58) could be thought of as proportional to day-to-day variability.  We used a classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach to cluster brain networks across fMRI sessions, as described by Gratton and colleagues24. This data driven approach was used to identify how different parameters (e.g. task, drug, individual) affect similarity/distance between networks. MDS places data in multidimensional space based on the similarity (Euclidean distance; correlation-based distances produce similar results) among data points – where in this case a data point represents the linearized upper triangle of a given functional network matrix. Each separate matrix (from a given subject, task, and session) was entered into the classical MDS algorithm (implemented using MATLAB 2019, cmdscale.m). Multiple dimensions of the data were explored. The eigenvectors were multiplied by the original FC matrices to generate a matrix of eigen-weights that corresponded to each dimension.  To assess network specificity of vertex-wise PSIL network change values, we calculated average network change of matched null networks consisting of randomly rotated networks with preserved size, shape, and relative position to each other. Following Gordon & Laumann et al., 2016, we employed a rotation-based null model, in which a subject’s subnetworks were iteratively rotated a random amount around the spherical expansion of the cortical surface. The spatial autocorrelation of smoothed BOLD data means that small networks are more likely to contain a single connectivity pattern than large networks. To create such matched random networks, we rotated each hemisphere of the original networks a random amount around the x, y, and z axes on the spherical expansion of the cortical surface. This procedure randomly relocated each network while maintaining networks’ size, shape, and relative positions to each other. Random rotation followed be computation of RSN-average PSIL network change score was repeated 1000 times to generate null distributions of network change scores. Vertices rotated into the medial wall were not included in the calculation. Actual PSIL network change score was then compared to null rotation permutations to generate a p-value for each of 12 systems (resting state networks) that were consistently present across every subject’s infomap parcellation. For bar graph visualization of ‘PSIL Change by System’ (Figs. 1, S3), RSNs with greater change (p<0.05 based on null rotation permutations) are shown their respective color (as indicated in Fig. S3) and all other RSNs are shown in gray. We used a n approach previously validated to assess spatial complexity (termed entropy) or neural signals39. Temporal principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the full BOLD dense timeseries, which yielded m principal components (m = ~80K surface vertices and subcortical voxels) and associated eigenvalues. The normalized eigenvalue of the i -th principal component was calculated as where m was the number of principal components, λ i and λ i represented the eigenvalue and the normalized eigenvalue of the i -th principal component respectively. Lastly, the NGSC, defined as the normalized entropy of normalized eigenvalues, was computed using the equation:  The NGSC computed above attains values from the interval 0 to 1. The lowest value NGSC=0 would mean the brain-wide BOLD signal consisted of exactly one principal component or spatial mode, and there is maximum global functional connectivity between all vertices. The highest value NGSC=1 would mean the total data variance is uniformly distributed across all m principal components, and a maximum spatial complexity or a lowest functional connectivity is found. To assess if persistent effects of psychedelics, we compared network changes 1–21 days post-psilocybin to pre-drug baseline. The network change analysis (described above) indicated that connectivity at the ‘whole brain’ level did not change following psilocybin (Fig. S2 and S3). A screen was conducted with p>0.05 threshold to identify brain systems or areas showing persisting effects. This analysis identified the anterior hippocampus as a candidate region of interest (ROI) for persisting FC change (see ‘Pre/Post Psilocybin Network Change Analysis’ in Extended Data). We assessed anterior hippocampus FC globally with cortex and specifically with the DMN. A bilateral anterior hippocampus ROI was used to generate a cortex-wide FC seed map for every session. Root-mean-square FC was computer to generate global FC67. Global FC was compared between pre-psilocybin sessions and post-psilocybin using a linear mixed effects model described above (drug condition and task were fixed effects, and Subject ID, MRI session, and head motion were random effects). Post-hoc visualization and timecourses were generated for FC with individual-defined default mode network. Raw fMRI and structural data from (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012) and (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) were run through our in-house registration and processing pipeline described above. These datasets were used for replication, external validation, and generalization to another classic psychedelic (i.e., LSD) for the measures described above (e.g., normalized global spatial complexity, and the MDS-derived psilocybin FC dimension (Dimension 1). Carhart-Harris et al., 2012: N=15 healthy adults completed two scanning sessions (psilocybin and saline) which included eyes-closed resting state BOLD scan for 6 minutes prior to and following I.V. infusion of drug. fMRI data were acquired using a gradient- echo EPI sequence, TR/TE 3000/35 ms, field-of-view = 192 mm, 64 × 64 acquisition matrix, parallel acceleration factor = 2, 90° flip angle. Carhart-Harris et al., 2016: N=22 healthy adults completed two scanning sessions (LSD and saline), which included eyes-closed resting state BOLD scan acquired for 22 minutes following I.V. drug infusion lasting 12 min. fMRI data were acquired using a gradient echo planer imaging sequence, TR/TE = 2000/35ms, field-of-view = 220mm, 64 × 64 acquisition matrix, parallel acceleration factor = 2, 90° flip angle, 3.4mm isotropic voxels.

288|"""A day after claiming White journalists that Vice President Kamala Harris had recently decided to become 'a White person,' Mr. Trump shared a photo of Ms. Harris in traditional African attire."""|Trump Escalates Race Attacks on Harris, Worrying Some Republicans   ADVERTISEMENT  A day after telling Black journalists that Vice President Kamala Harris had recently decided to become “a Black person,” Mr. Trump shared a photo of Ms. Harris in traditional Indian clothing. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Shane Goldmacher Donald J. Trump continued to raise false and incendiary questions about Vice President Kamala Harris’s racial identity for a second day on Thursday, as Republicans watched the former president drive his campaign into a divisive and potentially damaging direction. A day after telling an audience of Black journalists in Chicago that Ms. Harris had “all of a sudden” decided to become “a Black person,” Mr. Trump posted a photo on his social media site of Ms. Harris dressed in a sari with a caption stating: “Your warmth, friendship, and love of your Indian Heritage are very much appreciated.” Mr. Trump also amplified posts from Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist, who had posted copies of Ms. Harris’s birth certificate and had spread false accusations that Ms. Harris has lied about her race. Ms. Harris, whose father is from Jamaica, and whose mother was Indian American, has long identified with both her Black and South Asian heritage. ADVERTISEMENT An alumna of a historically Black institution, Howard University, she responded to Mr. Trump’s comments during her speech at a convention of Black sororities on Wednesday, saying, “The American people deserve better.” Whether Mr. Trump’s initial remarks on Wednesday were planned or not, the Trump team is clearly intensifying this line of attack. “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black,” Mr. Trump told the audience of Black journalists. “So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” For a Republican Party that has acclimatized itself to a decade of combustible comments from Mr. Trump, the reaction to his latest remarks had the feeling of a familiar routine: Republicans mostly rolled their eyes in private and held their tongues in public. David Kochel, a longtime Republican strategist, called the racial identity attack unneeded and risky when, he said, Mr. Trump had a clear case against Ms. Harris on policy grounds. ADVERTISEMENT “It’s a pretty simple campaign. Why complicate with questions around race is beyond me,” Mr. Kochel said. “The campaign is to tie her to the unpopular Biden economy and prosecute the case against her on the border.” But Mr. Trump’s campaign instead leaned into his questioning of Ms. Harris’s heritage. At a rally in Harrisburg, Pa. on Wednesday night, his campaign put headlines noting her Indian American background on the big screens above the crowd. “Rally signage is the best signage!” Jason Miller, a top Trump adviser, wrote on X with the laughing emoji. As Mr. Trump’s comments ricocheted around the political world, politicians from both parties seemed to be trying to determine whether such an attack would be effective in 2024, amid a rapidly diversifying electorate.

Where Harris stands on immigration, abortion and more. Trump’s 2025 Plans. Trump is preparing to radically reshape the government. Democrats denounced him as racist. “We need to fiercely call out this type of bigotry and ignorance,” Representative Maxwell Alejandro Frost of Florida wrote on X, responding to Mr. Trump’s post on Thursday of Ms. Harris in Indian garb. “During my primary race, some folks said similar things about me. That I wasn’t actually Black cause my mom is Cuban. Or that I’m not actually Latino because I’m Black.” ADVERTISEMENT The rare Republican to criticize Mr. Trump was Larry Hogan, the former Maryland governor, who is running for Senate against a Black woman, Angela Alsobrooks, the county executive of Prince George’s County, in a state where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular. Mr. Hogan denounced Mr. Trump’s comments as “unacceptable and abhorrent.” Others sought to refashion and reframe Mr. Trump’s baseless allegation, seeking safe ground through a more sanitized version. Those included Senator JD Vance, Mr. Trump’s running mate, who said at a rally on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had attended the Black journalists’ conference “because he’s running to be president for all Americans.” He attempted to recast Mr. Trump’s questions about Ms. Harris’s race as questions about her character. “Kamala Harris is a phony who caters to whatever audience is in front of her,” Mr. Vance said. Taylor Budowich, the chief executive of Make America Great Again Inc., the leading pro-Trump super PAC, echoed that view, saying, “Ms. Harris has an authenticity problem, and President Trump was right to expose it. ADVERTISEMENT “At every step of her career she has invented or reinvented herself, adopting whatever position, dialect, or story necessary to get what she wants,” Mr. Budowich said. Democrats were dubious that authenticity was the real issue. “To call someone a phony because of their race or ethnicity, that is not getting to the problem, that’s appealing to racism,” James Carville, a Democratic strategist, said. “I’m sorry, that excuse doesn’t fly.” Still, some Democrats privately said that the whole episode reminded them uncomfortably of 2016. Mr. Trump stoked controversy after controversy — dominating repeated news cycles — all summer that year before eventually defeating Hillary Clinton to win the White House. “We must stay vigilant and stay focused on the stakes in this election,” said Rahna Epting, the executive director of MoveOn, the progressive organizing group. Dennis Lennox, a Michigan-based Republican strategist, said that the episode was giving him flashbacks to his party’s struggles in 2008 to land a message against Barack Obama, who was then the Democratic presidential nominee. ADVERTISEMENT “Saying the sitting vice president of the United States, who is a Black woman, isn’t Black seems like you’re throwing everything against the wall and hoping something sticks,” he said. But Mr. Lennox was leaving open the possibility that Mr. Trump was injecting himself into what has been a 10-day period of favorable news and developments for Ms. Harris since she entered the race after President Biden bowed out and endorsed her. “Either Trump masterfully did that to stop the narrative that Kamala was building in the media, or he completely walked into the trap he’s walked into multiple times in the past,” Mr. Lennox said. “It’s an open question which one is correct.” For months, Mr. Trump has made claims that he plans to compete for a greater share of Black voters than Republicans have traditionally won. And for months Mr. Biden had struggled to excite Black voters, with polls showing him earning far less support than he had in 2020. Mr. Trump’s campaign has sought symbolic ways to signal his interest in Black voters, with his decision to agree to a question-and-answer session at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention as just the latest example. ADVERTISEMENT During the primary, he spoke at the Black Conservative Federation’s gala, where he claimed that “the Black people like me” because of his indictments in four criminal cases. And during his hush-money trial in New York, he held a rally that featured Black rappers. But the dynamics of the 2024 race have shifted since Mr. Biden stepped aside, and Mr. Trump is adjusting to the reality of running against a Black woman.

289|Iran has voted in a reformist president — but change remains distant|Iran has voted in a reformist president — but change remains distant                                                                                                                      Iran on Friday elected its first “reformist” president in 20 years, signaling many voters’ rejection of hard-line conservative policies amid low turnout of just 49%, according to official figures. Masoud Pezeshkian, a former health minister and member of parliament, was the most moderate of the candidates vying for the presidency after the sudden death of former President Ibrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May.  Described as a “token reformist” and “second-tier candidate” by many analysts, the 69-year-old Pezeshkian was seen as having scant chance at the presidency as he lacked name recognition and was up against a highly conservative system. “The whole election process leading to Pezeshkian’s victory now has indeed been surprising. It does mark a notable shift in Iran’s political landscape,” Sina Toossi, a senior nonresident fellow at the Center for International Policy, told CNBC. The result, Toossi said, “reflects a complex interplay of voter discontent, abstention, and a desire for change. Despite the heavily controlled and undemocratic nature of the election process, Pezeshkian’s success signals a rejection of hardline extremism and an appetite for reform and better relations with the global community.” His victory at the polls was all the more surprising given the fact that Iran’s ultra-conservative Guardian Council decides who is allowed to run for election in the first place, heavily favoring conservative candidates.  Still, Pezeshkian “faces substantial challenges from entrenched hardliners and external pressures, making his presidency a critical and uncertain chapter for Iran’s future,” Toossi said. Pezeshkian, a former heart surgeon who served as minister of health under the 1997-2005 mandate of Iran’s last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, said he wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran’s strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially restarting nuclear talks with world powers. But “reformist” is a relative term in Iran, as Pezeshkian still voices his support for the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and has expressed no intention to challenge the theocratic system of the Islamic Republic. Pezeshkian “is a reformist who has many times over the last few weeks come out and said that Khamenei’s way, or direction, is the way, and he fully intends to follow that path,” said Nader Itayim, Mideast Gulf editor at Argus Media. “He’s not a reformist who is going to try to come in and shake things up. In that sense he’s a low-risk option” for Khamenei and may have been seen by religious authorities as “manageable,” Itayim said. For Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the election of Pezeshkian is nothing more than a cosmetic change. “Pezeshkhian offers the regime the chance to once again offer stylistic changes in exchange for substantive concessions from the West,” Ben Taleblu said. “Faced with mounting domestic and international challenges, particularly after the 2022-2023 ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ nationwide uprising against the regime, Tehran is trying to again tempt the West with the same fiction of moderation.” Months of protests for women’s rights and the downfall of the Iranian regime rocked Iran and its hard-line government following the death of a young Kurdish-Iranian woman named Mahsa Amini in September 2022. Amini died in police custody after being arrested for allegedly improperly wearing her headscarf, which women in Iran are required to wear. The protests led to severe crackdowns and frequent internet blackouts by Iranian authorities, as well as thousands of arrests and several executions. But despite Pezeshkian’s stated support for relaxing things like headscarf penalties, Iran-focused human rights groups are not optimistic. “Anyone pledging loyalty to the [Iranian] constitution, a ‘reformist,’ a ‘moderate,’ a ‘conservative’ … is ultimately a hardliner by democratic standards,” the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran wrote in a report Friday. “This is why many Iranians have lost hope in bringing about change through the ballot boxes and are boycotting elections.”  “The choice of the president may lead to minor shifts but, even in the best case scenario, it will fail to bring significant change to Iran,” the report read. “The core structure of Iran’s theocratic regime, where a Supreme Leader’s authority eclipses that of any president, will remain steadfastly intact. … In essence, Iran’s theocracy is designed to resist meaningful change.” Turning to foreign policy, analysts predict no change in the support and funding for regional proxy groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the Houthi rebels in Yemen — something that the Iranian president himself has little power over anyway.  Pezeshkian wants to focus on sanctions relief for Iran and its battered economy and has talked about repairing some relations with the West, particularly on the issue the Iranian nuclear deal, which lifted harsh economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on the country’s nuclear program.  Iran is now closer than ever to bomb-making capability, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency — and at the same time, former President Donald Trump, who introduced a strict set of sanctions against Tehran during his previous term, may return to the White House in November. If Trump takes office and maintains his previously staunch position of piling sanctions on Iran and abandoning the nuclear deal, then Pezeshkian’s goals are essentially futile.   The Iranian election result presents a “potential to open up to the West, but comes at precisely the wrong time given we are at the [potential] end of the Biden presidency, and likely a Trump presidency and the GOP hawks will have zero interest of engagement with Iran,” Tim Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, said in an email note. “Notable I think that Iran, like the Gulf states, would want to concentrate on the economy as a drive to alleviate political pressure,” he added, “but seems unlikely that given the U.S. political cycle, and events in Gaza, there will be any desire to open up to ‘reformers’ in Iran.” Got a confidential news tip?

297|Wayanad tragedy: How different parties, governments, states ensure reports on Western Ghats stay buried|Wayanad tragedy: How different parties, governments, states ensure reports on Western Ghats stay buried  The Wayanad landslide disaster where the toll has crossed 200, with around 300 people still missing, has drawn the issue of pending protection for the ecologically fragile Western Ghats into the spotlight again. It has been 13 years since an expert panel led by ecologist Madhav Gadgil submitted its report, recommending designating the entire Ghats region as an ecologically sensitive zone (ESZ), a graded zonation approach to regulating activities, and creation of an overarching ecological authority for the region. The landmark report was met with political protests and demands to shrink the ESZ areas for industries and other development activities. These also ensured that the recommendations of the K Kasturirangan-led expert panel — which was formed to review the Gadgil report — have also remained on paper. As it stands today, a draft notification of the Centre, demarcating nearly 60,000 sq km of the Ghats as an ecologically sensitive area (ESA), on the prescription of the Kasturirangan panel, continues to be in limbo. While the Gadgil panel had recommended broad ESZs, the Kasturirangan committee proposed ESAs, with one village categorised as one unit of ESA. Of this 60,000 sq km area, 449 sq km falls in Gujarat, 17,340 sq km in Maharashtra, 1,461 sq km in Goa, 20,668 sq km in Karnataka, and 6,914 sq km in Tamil Nadu. Kerala did its own ground-truthing exercise in response to the Kasturirangan report and declared 9,993.7 sq km as ESA. However, the Centre has been unable to achieve a political consensus on the area to be notified as ESA. Moreover, another committee, headed by Sanjay Kumar, former Director General of Forests, Environment Ministry, is now examining the issue. Opposition by states Both the Gadgil and Kasturirangan panel reports have been opposed by successive governments in Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat – irrespective of the parties in power. Their opposition has broadly been based on the apprehension that the hard lines drawn to prohibit certain activities and the demarcation of whole villages as ESAs will deprive them of economic growth opportunities. State governments have also carried out independent ground-truthing exercises in response to the ESA demarcation proposed by the Kasturirangan panel. For instance, during a review of the Gadgil report in 2013, the Congress-led UDF government in Kerala submitted to the Kasturirangan panel that the state’s foreign exchange would be affected if large parts of Wayanad and Idukki districts were demarcated as ESA, as these had agricultural areas where cash crops were grown. The then state Finance Minister, K M Mani, also said in the submission that if the Gadgil report was implemented, “normal agricultural and human activities would become impossible”. The same year, in November, protests against implementing the Kasturirangan report turned violent in the hilly regions of north Kerala’s Kozhikode and Kannur districts after the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) issued orders prohibiting quarrying, mining, and red category of industries in ecologically sensitive zones. Then Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said the state government would not allow implementation of the report’s recommendations in a “manner affecting life” and called for a “more practical approach”. In January 2014, the Kerala Assembly unanimously passed a resolution asking the Centre to exempt populated, agricultural, and plantation areas from the ambit of ecologically fragile land. Both the Kasturirangan panel and a three-member expert committee formed by the Kerala government in 2013 had recommended that the Meppadi panchayat in Wayanad, the site of Tuesday’s landslide, be included in the larger eco-sensitive zone being demarcated in the state. However, the recommendations were not implemented. Maharashtra’s Congress-NCP government submitted to the Union Environment Ministry in 2012 — the Congress was in power at the Centre too at the time — that the creation of an overarching Western Ghats Ecological Authority would run parallel to existing government agencies, and opposed the idea. Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu also opposed the embargo proposed on new hydropower projects. The stand of Karnataka, with largest sensitive area In its official response to the Kasturirangan report in 2015, the then Congress government in Karnataka said that an expert committee set up by it had concluded that only 153, and not 1,553, villages in the state be declared ESAs. The Karnataka government also called for permission for ecotourism in the protected areas, expansion of existing power plants, and stone quarrying and sand mining, saying this was needed for local development needs. Too many restrictions “in the absence of larger public appreciation and support… will defeat the very purpose of conserving ecology and environment in the Western Ghats”, the state said. However, it said, mining could be barred. In 2022, when the BJP government at the Centre proposed the notification of ESAs in the Western Ghats, then Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai of the BJP took a delegation of MLAs and MPs from the Western Ghats — predominantly from the BJP at the time — to meet Environment Minister Bhupendra Yadav to dissuade him. Then Karnataka Home Minister Araga Jnanendra said if the draft notification was accepted as it was, “it will affect the lives of people in rural areas”. How things stand Senior environmentalist V S Vijayan, who was a member of the Gadgil panel, told The Indian Express that both the UPA and NDA governments should have done more to communicate the intent of their committee. Instead, a narrative took hold that their recommendations were “anti-people”, Vijayan said. “I still stand by our recommendations and the government should revisit our report. I believe that if our recommendations were followed, incidents like the Wayanad disaster could have been averted,” he said. Pandurang Hegde, an environmental activist associated with the Save Western Ghats Movement in Karnataka, the state with the largest ESA cover in the Ghats region, said that irrespective of which political party is in power, they have always projected protection of Western Ghats as an “anti-people issue”. “Madhav Gadgil always said that let the people decide on the zonation. Those with vested interests desiring to exploit natural resources do not want the demarcation of ESAs and politicians have used local people as a shield to justify the delays,” Hegde said. On Friday, in the wake of rain damage in the Kodagu area of Karnataka, which falls in the Western Ghats region, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah said the state had reconsidered the Kasturirangan report but again come to the conclusion that it was “not beneficial to people” of the state. This was after a suggestion by the Congress government’s Environment and Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre that the state would adopt the Kasturirangan report’s recommendations. Khandre later clarified that he had never said the state was “bound to implement” the report. — With inputs from Johnson T A Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates In Bangladesh turmoil, a lesson for the Global South            An award-winning journalist with 14 years of experience, Nikhil Ghanekar is an Assistant Editor with the National Bureau [Government] of The Indian Express in New Delhi.

On Thursday, August 1, Reynolds took to social media to poke fun at his 7-year-old daughter, Inez, who made a cameo as Kidpool in his latest film, Deadpool and Wolverine. Sharing a movie still of himself as the titular anti-hero facing off against his daughter, Reynolds wrote on X (formerly Twiiter), “Only costar I argued with. Most people think Kidpool is the dirtiest. But she’s also pretty good at backtalk and never taking out the trash. #DeadpoolAndWolverine.”  ALSO READ  NSYNC edited the title of Bye Bye Bye on YouTube with release of Deadpool & Wolverine Deadpool and Wolverine, which hit theatres on Friday, July 26, was a true family affair for Reynolds. His just-year-old son, Olin, also made a cameo as the aptly named character Baby Pool. Reynolds’ wife, Blake Lively, made a masked appearance as Lady Deadpool. Lively revealed via Instagram in July that Deadpool comic creator Rob Liefeld created Lady Deadpool after seeing the actress on Gossip Girl in the '00s. The couple’s 4-year-old daughter, Betty, also had a role in the production, which was humorously acknowledged during the movie’s credits with the line, “Hugh Jackman Wrangler: Betty Reynolds.” Reynolds has previously spoken about Betty’s fondness for Hugh Jackman, who portrayed Wolverine. During a joint interview with Jackman at the movie’s premiere in July, Reynolds told Extra, “They’re all kind of in love with Uncle Hughy over here, so that worked out pretty well. He got attacked by Betty backstage, who thinks she has claws, so she goes at him. I have to actually give her a little tiny time-out.” He also told People, “I don't profess that my kids are perfectly behaved. My 4-year-old Betty sort of loves Hugh, like unconditionally. And she expresses that love through unblinking violence. So she attacks him, thinking she has claws and he has a healing factor — which he might.” ALSO READ  Deadpool & Wolverine box office collection day 5: Ryan Reynolds-Hugh Jackman film takes India total to ₹78 crore Along with Inez, Olin, and Betty, Reynolds and Lively also share a 9-year-old daughter named James.

NEW YORK (AP) — Kamala Harris is smashing fundraising records as the Democratic Party’s donors — big and small — open their wallets for the vice president in the immediate aftermath of President Joe Biden’s stunning decision to step aside. In total, Harris’ team raised more than $81 million in the 24-hour period since Biden’s announcement, campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said Monday. The massive haul, which includes money raised across the campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees, represents the largest 24-hour sum reported by either side in the 2024 campaign. Harris’ campaign said it was the largest single-day total in U.S. history. “The historic outpouring of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections,” Munoz said. Hours earlier, Future Forward, the largest super PAC in Democratic politics, announced it had secured $150 million in commitments over the same period from donors who were “previously stalled, uncertain or uncommitted,” a senior adviser said. Taken together, the fundraising explosion puts Harris in a dominant position to secure the Democratic Party’s formal presidential nomination at next month’s national convention — if not sooner. The donor class’s embrace comes as she locks up endorsements from the vast majority of Democratic governors and members of Congress. The huge haul also ensures that Harris and her allies can compete with Donald Trump, who has generated stunning fundraising totals of his own in recent weeks as he fights to return to the White House following multiple felony convictions and an assassination attempt.  “This is the next generation people have been waiting for,” Michael Kempner, a member of Biden’s national finance team, said of Harris’ emergence. “The donors I’ve spoken to are enthusiastic about supporting her. And even those that may have preferred an open convention have quickly coalesced around her overnight.” Harris’ initial 24-hour fundraising total easily bested the $50 million Trump raised immediately after felony convictions and the $38 million Biden secured over the four days that followed last month’s disastrous debate performance. The Trump campaign has not said how much it raised immediately after last weekend’s assassination attempt; a spokesman didn’t respond to a request Monday. Overall, the Harris campaign said 888,000 grassroots donors made donations over the previous 24 hours; more than 500,000 were making their first contribution of the 2024 campaign cycle. And while there are a few vocal holdouts among the party’s elite donor class, most appear to be lining up behind Harris as they mobilize to help capitalize on her newfound momentum. At least two major donor calls were scheduled by Harris allies Monday, while the Democratic National Committee was set to host another major donor call in the middle of the week. Most big-dollar donors wanted Biden to step aside, as did the majority of rank-and-file Democratic voters. And on Monday, there was a palpable sense of relief and excitement among those who feared Biden would not choose to step aside, despite overwhelming concerns about his physical and mental strength. “It was a cliffhanger. Nobody really knew what was happening,” said Michael Smith, an Los Angeles donor who, along with his partner James Costos, held numerous fundraisers for Biden. “Now it’s a new game. And in a TikTok-influenced world, the campaign ahead is going to be short, dynamic and reenergizing.” What to know about the 2024 Election Not everyone was happy. Democratic donor Vinod Khosla, a tech billionaire, said on social media that he isn’t ready to back Harris immediately. “I want an open process at the convention and not a coronation,” he posted on X. “The key still is who can best beat (Trump) above all other priorities given how much a danger he is.” John Morgan, another major Democratic donor, indicated he would not raise any more money for Harris if she becomes the nominee, having already given $1 million to Biden. “You have to be enthusiastic or hoping for a political appointment to be asking friends for money. I am neither. It’s others’ turn now,” Morgan posted on X. Such critics appeared to be in the minority Monday. Chad Griffin, a member of the campaign’s national finance committee and a top Democratic fundraiser in the Los Angeles area, said the party is lucky to have Harris “ready to finish the job she and President Biden started together.” “She’s the trusted, tested leader we need to carry us to victory in November,” he said in a statement. “I am all in to elect Kamala Harris our next President of the United States.” With Biden’s endorsement, Harris’ campaign appears to have inherited his sprawling national infrastructure and tens of millions of dollars that his team previously raised. At the end of June, the Biden-Harris campaign reported nearly $96 million cash in the bank, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. On Sunday, the Biden-Harris campaign filed new paperwork with the FEC establishing Harris as the principal candidate. There is some debate among campaign finance officials over whether Harris now has complete control of the funds, although few expect any serious legal challenges. Meanwhile, Harris’ campaign sent out a new flurry of fundraising emails and text messages Monday. “Now is our chance to make history,” Harris declared in one text message asking donors for $20.

313|OpenAI announces a search engine called SearchGPT; Alphabet shares dip|OpenAI announces a search engine called SearchGPT; Alphabet shares dip                                                                                                                      In this article OpenAI on Thursday announced a prototype of its search engine, called SearchGPT, which aims to give users “fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.” The company said it eventually plans to integrate the tool, which is currently being tested with a small group of users, into its ChatGPT chatbot. The rollout could have implications for Google and its dominant search engine. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Alphabet investors have been concerned that OpenAI could take market share from Google in search by giving consumers new ways to seek information online.  With this prototype, OpenAI is testing the waters for doing just that, promising users the chance to “search in a more natural, intuitive way” and ask follow-up questions “just like you would in a conversation.” “We think there is room to make search much better than it is today,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote Thursday in a post on X. Alphabet shares fell more than 3% on Thursday to close at $167.28, while the Nasdaq was down less than 1%. In May, Google launched AI Overview, which CEO Sundar Pichai called the biggest change in search in 25 years, to a limited audience, allowing users to see a summary of answers to queries at the very top of Google Search. Though Google had been working on AI Overview for more than a year, public criticism mounted after  users quickly noticed that queries returned nonsensical or inaccurate results within the AI feature — without any way to opt out. “Google has been kind of shaking in their boots a little bit since this stuff first popped off,” said Daniel Faggella, founder and head of research at Emerj Artificial Intelligence Research, referring to generative artificial intelligence. “We haven’t seem their company crumble in the interim, but we have seen them kind of fumble.”  The SearchGPT announcement follows OpenAI’s launch last Thursday of a new AI model, “GPT-4o mini.” The new model is an offshoot of GPT-4o, the startup’s fastest and most powerful model to date, which it launched in May during a livestreamed event with executives.  OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, has been valued at more than $80 billion by investors. The company, founded in 2015, is under pressure to stay on top of the generative AI market while finding ways to make money as it spends massive sums on processors and infrastructure to build and train its models. Last Month, OpenAI announced the hiring of two top executives as well as a partnership with Apple that includes a ChatGPT-Siri integration. Sarah Friar, previously CEO of Nextdoor and finance chief at Square, joined as chief financial officer, and Kevin Weil, an ex-president at Planet Labs and former senior vice president at Twitter and a vice president at Facebook and Instagram, joined as chief product officer. OpenAI is bolstering its C-suite as its large language models gain importance across the tech sector and as competition rapidly emerges in the burgeoning generative AI market.  Both OpenAI’s new mini AI model and the prototype of SearchGPT are also part of the company’s push to be at the forefront of “multimodality,” or the ability to offer a wide range of types of AI-generated media, like text, images, audio, video and search, inside one tool: ChatGPT. For SearchGPT, OpenAI’s blog post said the tool’s visual results will lead to “richer understanding” for users. Last year, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC, “The world is multimodal.” He added that as humans “engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things,” so limiting interactions to text is insufficient.

NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Peter Baker Peter Baker covers the White House and previously spent four years reporting from Moscow. Even in the world of presidential multitasking, July 21 turns out to have been an extraordinary, whipsaw Sunday for President Biden. At 12:09 p.m., he picked up the phone at his vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., to talk with the prime minister of Slovenia as part of a high-stakes diplomatic gamble to seal a complicated, multinational prisoner swap. Just 97 minutes later, he posted a world-stunning letter online abandoning his bid for re-election after a bruising pressure campaign by his own Democratic allies, climaxing the biggest crisis of his political career and signaling the end of his presidency after a half-century in public life. By any measure, it was one of the darkest moments of his time in elective office as the inescapable reality of time, age and polls finally caught up with him. And yet it would lead to one of the most joyous days of his presidency barely a week and a half later as he orchestrated the release of imprisoned Americans from the dungeons of Russia. ADVERTISEMENT For Mr. Biden and his team, the successful negotiation to free 16 people held by Russia on Thursday, including three American citizens and a U.S. permanent resident, offered sweet validation even as the clock is now ticking toward his final curtain call in office. When the president appeared with relatives of the liberated prisoners in the State Dining Room of the White House, it was clearly personal to him and he framed it as a mission on behalf of the larger American family. “My dad had a simple proposition: Family is the beginning, the middle and the end. Blood of my blood and bone of my bone,” Mr. Biden said before hugging the daughter of one of the freed prisoners. “I could think of nothing more consequential.” As he often does, he drew on his own experience of personal tragedy. “Having lost family,” albeit in a very different way, he said that bringing home these tortured souls now, well, “it matters, it matters.” It clearly mattered to him too. Although he made no mention of the incredible timing of his diplomatic triumph, just an hour and a half before his political surrender, it reinforced a commitment to making his last five months in power count. He may be a lame duck now, but he has no intention of heading off quietly into the night — except his trip late Thursday to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, where he welcomed home the Americans. Mr. Biden’s staff made a point of talking up his diplomatic deftness in brokering the deal, bringing together seven countries in the largest such swap since the Cold War. And they emphasized that he and his administration had helped free more than 70 Americans wrongfully detained abroad during his tenure. ADVERTISEMENT “This was vintage Joe Biden,” said Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. “If you had not had Joe Biden sitting in the Oval Office, I don’t think this would have happened.” Mr. Sullivan, who has been personally invested in bringing home the hostages for years and had to deliver bad news to their families on many occasions, grew teary-eyed himself in the White House briefing room. “Today was a very good day,” he said, choking up. It was Mr. Sullivan who set up the president’s critical call with Prime Minister Robert Golob of Slovenia on July 21, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share behind-the-scenes details. The day before, on Saturday, July 20, Mr. Sullivan had been in Colorado for a meeting of the Aspen Strategy Group and worked the phones to bring together the deal. He was talking with his counterpart from Slovenia, which had agreed in principle to release two Russians held by that Balkan country as part of the swap to free the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and the others held by Moscow.

But the two Russians would have to be pardoned, and the Slovenians said they could not do that in time, according to the U.S. official. So Mr. Sullivan asked if he could arrange a call from the president to the prime minister. After flying back to Washington, Mr. Sullivan called from his home that Sunday and connected the two leaders through the White House Situation Room, according to the U.S. official. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Biden was in isolation in Rehoboth recovering from Covid — and unknown to nearly the whole world, finalizing his letter withdrawing from the race. Even Mr. Sullivan, one of Mr. Biden’s closest advisers, had no idea what the president was about to do when he patched through the call and only learned later — and not from the president. During the phone call, which lasted just a few minutes, Mr. Biden implored Mr. Golob to facilitate the release of the two Russians in his custody. In making his pitch, Mr. Biden even offered to visit Slovenia, the U.S. official said. What Mr. Biden did not say was that he would only have a few months left in office to follow up on that idea. Mr. Sullivan, asked about the timing of the call shortly before the withdrawal, said it was simply happenstance. “That’s when the pieces were falling in place,” he said. It was hardly the only conversation Mr. Biden had during the months of haggling. He reached out personally to other foreign leaders, most critically Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, who for a long time had resisted releasing Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin convicted of murdering a Chechen separatist in Germany on state orders. ADVERTISEMENT But with Mr. Biden pressing him, and the prospect of winning the release of Aleksei Navalny, the most prominent Russian opposition leader who was in prison, Mr. Scholz finally relented. “For you, I will do this,” he told Mr. Biden in January, according to U.S. officials. Mr. Navalny died in prison a few weeks later, temporarily sabotaging the deal. But Mr. Scholz still went along with releasing Mr. Krasikov in the end and got five German nationals imprisoned in Russia in trade. “The deal that made this possible was a feat of diplomacy and friendship — friendship,” Mr. Biden said on Thursday. In a veiled reference to former President Donald J. Trump, who constantly berates and belittles America’s European partners, Mr. Biden added: “For anyone who questions whether allies matter, they do. They matter.” No longer facing another election might have made it easier on some level for Mr. Biden to risk whatever political fallout there might be for the swap. It was an uncomfortable compromise. No one liked giving up a killer like Mr. Krasikov for innocent Americans like Mr. Gershkovich, the Marine veteran Paul Whelan and the journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, along with Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian opposition leader and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Washington Post who is a permanent U.S. resident. ADVERTISEMENT Trading for hostages always raises the tricky question of whether it encourages the hostage-takers to do it again. Unsurprisingly, Republicans quickly made that point, most loudly Mr. Trump, who is seeking his old job back and denounced giving anything away to free American prisoners. “To do so is bad precedent for the future,” Mr. Trump wrote on his social media site in a posting that did not even pause to celebrate the freedom for the Americans and others released. “That’s the way it should be, or this situation will get worse and worse. They are extorting the United States of America.” But in fact, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sullivan decided early in his administration that the old politics no longer applied and that they should be willing to make trades, when justified, to free imprisoned Americans. For all the predictable criticism that would come, they concluded that there was really no meaningful domestic political cost, nor was it clear that refusing to make deals would necessarily stop hostage taking. In that case, they reasoned that it was better just to get Americans home rather than stand on what they considered a pointless principle and leave innocent people wasting away in foreign prisons or terrorist sanctuaries. They did so for Trevor R. Reed, an ailing former U.S. Marine held in Russia on what his family called bogus charges of assault, and they did so again for Brittney Griner, the W.N.B.A. star arrested in Moscow on what U.S. officials considered trumped-up drug charges. Left out of all those deals, though, was Marc Fogel, an American teacher sentenced to 14 years in a labor camp after being found with medical marijuana. Biden aides said they would keep trying to free him too. ADVERTISEMENT When Mr. Biden appeared on Thursday with the families of Mr. Gershkovich and the others, he laughed off a claim by Mr. Trump that if he were elected again, he would get President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to simply free American prisoners without receiving anything in return. “Why didn’t he do it when he was president?” Mr. Biden asked. With that, he headed out of the room. There was more to do. In fact, he had another important phone call to make, this one with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. There were, after all, more crises to confront, more hostages to try to free and not much time left. Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.

321|Extra Kissed by Francis Ford Coppola in ‘Megalopolis’ Set Video Breaks Silence: ‘I Was in Shock’|Extra Kissed by Francis Ford Coppola in ‘Megalopolis’ Set Video Breaks Silence: ‘I Was in Shock’   An extra on the set of Francis Ford Coppola’s “Megalopolis” has come forward to describe the “shock” she felt after the director kissed her during the filming of a scene. Her comments come a week after Variety published videos of the Oscar-winning filmmaker milling through a crowd while stopping to kiss female background actors. One of the women in the video, Lauren Pagone, who appeared in multiple scenes in “Megalopolis” as an extra, says she was dancing in the middle of a live take of a nightclub sequence when Coppola approached her and pulled her toward him. He then hugged and kissed her.    “I was in shock. I didn’t expect him to kiss and hug me like that. I was caught off guard. And I can tell you he came around a couple times.”    Pagone has worked on several studio projects in recent years including Paramount+’s “Mayor of Kingstown” and Apple TV+’s “City on Fire” and says the situation was unusual. On every other project Pagone had done, an intimacy coordinator was on hand during any scenes in which there was nudity.  Several actresses were cleared to do topless nudity for the nightclub sequence, according to a call sheet reviewed by Variety. Pagone did not appear nude and was outfitted in a top with a plunging neckline.  Pagone decided to come forward when another woman, Rayna Menz, told Deadline that she was one of the actresses seen in one of the two videos published by Variety. Menz told the trade publication that Coppola “did nothing to make me or for that matter anyone on set feel uncomfortable.”   Menz did not respond to an email from Variety requesting additional comment. Pagone was upset that Menz would speak for the entire cast and crew of the film. “I don’t appreciate anybody speaking for me. I would never speak for that actress,” Pagone adds. “I’ve kept my mouth shut. I’ve kept quiet. But it’s frustrating that she’s putting out there, ‘Hey, it was great for everyone’ when she doesn’t know what other people were feeling. You can’t speak for anyone but yourself. My experience was different.”   A spokesperson for Coppola said no one was available for comment on this article.    “Megalopolis” intimacy coordinator Samantha McDonald previously told Variety that neither she nor Ashley Anderson, the film’s other intimacy coordinator, were on set for the nightclub scene, which was filmed on Feb. 14, 2023, at Atlanta’s Tabernacle concert hall. “I can’t really speak to the reason why they chose to bring us in when they did and not when they didn’t,” McDonald said.  In recent days, another member of the cast approached Variety to say that they had witnessed Coppola kissing “multiple women” during a different scene involving a New Year’s Eve celebration. Shortly before filming started, Coppola told the extras that he wanted them to act as they would at a typical holiday party and kiss each other at the end of the countdown, the cast member said. He added that he might jump in and kiss a few people himself. After calling cut, Coppola got up, stopped multiple women as they passed him and kissed them on the cheek. “The women that I saw being kissed did not see him coming. He just basically grabbed them and planted the kiss on them without any kind of consent,” the person added. “They all kind of laughed it off for a moment and then I could tell that they were just surprised.” The crew member who shot the video that Variety initially shared and who was on the set for almost all of the shoot confirmed that Coppola kissed female extras during the filming of the New Year’s Eve sequence and said it was one of several instances in which the director kissed background performers. The cast member who has worked on a number of high-profile productions in and around Atlanta says, “My entire experience being on that set was super weird and uncomfortable. It was probably the worst experience for me on a set ever.” The videos that Variety previously published seemed to corroborate parts of a May report in the Guardian that claimed the 85-year-old director “tried to kiss some of the topless and scantily clad female extras” and told them “he was ‘trying to get them in the mood.’” In one of Variety’s videos, Coppola can be seen moving toward Pagone who turns her back to him. He then pulls her closer to him and appears to hug and kiss her.  Sources said Coppola, a film icon who has directed classics such as “The Godfather” and “The Conversation,” appeared to act with impunity on set. They noted that because Coppola financed the entire $120 million budget himself, there was no place to complain about unorthodox behavior. Movies that are produced by streamers and major studios have more formalized human resources departments where actors and crew members can raise issues and concerns.  The crew member who took the video told Variety that Coppola kept leaping up to hug and kiss several women, often inadvertently inserting himself into the shot and ruining it, which the crew member said was unusual. (Pagone confirmed to Variety that the video she appears in was during a live shot and was not taken during a break.)   The crew member said that after multiple takes, Coppola got on a microphone and announced in earshot of everyone in the room, “Sorry, if I come up to you and kiss you. Just know it’s solely for my pleasure.” Lionsgate is releasing “Megalopolis,” which stars Adam Driver, Aubrey Plaza and Shia LaBeouf, domestically on Sept. 27.

363|"""Kamala Harris fails to secure enough votes for the Democratic presidential nomination, party chair claims"""|How did Kamala Harris wrap up the Democratic nomination in 32 hours?  COMMENTARY  September 3, 2024     It was a remarkable display of unity for a political party famous for its tendency to form a circular firing squad. In between 2:00 PM EST on July 21, when it became known that President Joe Biden would not run again, and 9:48 PM EST on July 22, when the Associated Press announced that Vice President Kamala Harris had the support of enough convention delegates to win the nomination—the oldest political party in the world replaced the nominee chosen in the primaries. How did that happen? The story unfolds on two levels. During the approximately three weeks between President Biden’s fatal debate and his decision to drop out of the race, the Biden campaign attempted a reset. In a much-anticipated press conference following the NATO Summit in Washington, Biden failed to erase the impression that he was simply too old for the job even though he spoke intelligently about complex foreign policy issues. During this period, people familiar with the Democratic Party rules pointed out that Rule 13J of the delegate selection rules contained a loophole that would allow convention delegates to vote for whoever they wanted to vote for; just because Biden had won the vast majority of delegates didn’t mean the delegates were stuck with him. And during this period, congressional leaders, worried about how the collapse of support for Biden would affect their own candidates, engaged in nonstop, intense conversations about how to get Biden out of the race. On July 2, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), dean of the black congressional delegation, announced that he would support Harris if Biden stepped aside. It was a not-so-subtle warning to anyone thinking of challenging Harris that Black elected officials would not take kindly to challenges to a Black Vice President from white elected officials, but it also acknowledged the reality that Biden should consider stepping aside. On July 10, Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) was the first United States Senator to call for Biden to drop out. He did it in an article in the Washington Post, which was respectful of the President but also argued out loud what almost everyone else was thinking—for the good of the country, Biden had to go. On that same day, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi gave an interview on MSNBC where she said “It’s up to Biden to decide if he’s going to run. Whatever he decides we go with.” Following firm statements from the White House that Biden would in fact run, this was widely interpreted as Pelosi saying Biden should not run. During those three weeks, pundits came up with ways to hold a “mini primary” or some process by which the party could replace Biden. While interesting and creative, these plans all had the same flaws; the party already had a process for replacing Biden—it was called the Democratic National Convention. There was simply no time to organize any pre-convention activities, and no one else seemed interested in running for the Democratic nomination. And so…on to the untold portion of the story. By the time of Biden’s debate fiasco, all 50 states plus territories had finished electing their delegates to the convention. The delegates had all been elected, either in open meetings in their congressional districts, at a state convention, or, in some states, on the ballot. They too had been having the same conversations as every other Democrat in the country—should Biden run, and if not, who should? The views of these 3,770 pledged delegates were largely ignored by the press even though they vastly outnumbered the 749 automatic delegates (representatives, senators, governors, DNC members, etc.) who were getting the most attention. The press was so focused on the congressional party that no one tried polling the very group that would control the decision. In all but 11 states, the state delegation chair was the chair of the Democratic Party. The state chairs are a close bunch, organized under the rubric of the Association of State Democratic Parties (ASDC) and headed by the Minnesota State Chair, Ken Martin. According to Martin, during the three weeks between the debate and Biden’s decision, the state party chairs, like their congressional counterparts, stuck by Biden publicly but they kept their ears to the ground and picked up the fact that “folks were getting restless.” On Friday, July 19, Martin pulled together a virtual meeting of the ASDC’s Executive committee, consisting of about 50 state chairs, vice chairs, and executive directors. This group, unlike those floating alternative systems, are the people who actually put together the nomination system. They send out the notices, set the filing deadlines, choose the school gyms and union halls where meetings will be held, adjudicate the disputes, and do the million other tasks needed to constitute a democratically elected convention. They knew better than most that it was simply too late to run a mini primary. They agreed that if Biden didn’t run, they would reconvene the entire ASDC and whip their delegates to endorse Harris. As Martin put it, “There was no time for a family food fight.” On the night of July 21, hours after Biden’s decision to drop out became public, Martin called a virtual meeting of all 180 state chairs, vice chairs, and executive directors where they decided to poll their delegations with the expectation that Harris would receive all the support. At 4:00 PM Central Time, Tennessee became the first state to pledge delegates to Harris. Seventy delegates joined a Zoom call and voted unanimously to endorse Harris. While two delegates did not attend the call (former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Steve Cohen), they had already publicly expressed their support for the vice president. Metro Nashville School Board member and delegate Freda Player spoke in favor of Harris. Later that evening, South Carolina became the second state to pledge its 55 delegates to Harris. That same evening, North Carolina’s 116 delegates joined a virtual “emergency meeting” led by Anderson Clayton, the chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party and unanimously endorsed Harris, thus becoming the third state to pledge delegates to Harris. Delegates also expressed support for Gov. Roy Cooper as the vice-presidential nominee. By the end of the night, New Hampshire, Florida, Louisiana, Guam, and Alaska had also endorsed Harris. By the end of the next day, July 22, 25 states had endorsed Harris, and the Associated Press announced that she had enough votes to secure the nomination on a first ballot. By 9:00 PM on July 24, the elected officials followed and 100% of the Democratic governors, 96% of Democratic senators, and 94% of Democratic representatives endorsed Harris. Why was the consensus around Harris so fast? Certainly, lack of time played a role, as did the absence of any serious challenger. But one other factor was at play. As I know from personal experience, having worked for Vice President Al Gore, vice presidents have a heck of a time getting press coverage. They do the hard and unglamorous work for their president and their party, attending the state party conventions and the Jefferson-Jackson Day dinners and speaking to reporters in secondary or tertiary markets. But the party activists who regularly turn out for their events are the same people who run for delegate slots at the convention and get out the vote in elections. For much of the public, Kamala Harris was the 2020 candidate who dropped out before the first primary, but for many of the people in Ken Martin’s world, she was a more mature candidate and a familiar and welcome presence. That is how Harris achieved a modern political miracle. RELATED CONTENT Linda Peek Schacht August 29, 2024 Elaine Kamarck, William A.

370|The Pennsylvania governor, a top contender to be Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, wrote in his college newspaper that Palestinians were “too battle-minded.”|Shapiro’s College-Era Criticism of Palestinians Draws Fresh Scrutiny   ADVERTISEMENT The Pennsylvania governor, a top contender to be Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, wrote in his college newspaper that Palestinians were “too battle-minded.” By Neil Vigdor Gov. Josh Shapiro, Democrat of Pennsylvania, wrote in his college newspaper three decades ago that Palestinians were “too battle-minded” to achieve a two-state solution in the Middle East, prompting criticism as Vice President Kamala Harris considers him to be her running mate. Mr. Shapiro, 51, has embraced his Jewish identity and been one of the Democratic Party’s staunchest defenders of Israel at a moment when the party is splintered over the war in Gaza. But he says his views have evolved since publishing an opinion essay as a college student at the University of Rochester in New York, when he wrote that Palestinians were incapable of establishing their own homeland and making it successful, even with help from Israel and the United States. “They are too battle-minded to be able to establish a peaceful homeland of their own,” he wrote in the essay, published in the Sept. 23, 1993, edition of The Campus Times, the student newspaper. “They will grow tired of fighting amongst themselves and will turn outside against Israel.” ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Shapiro, who was 20 at the time, noted in his essay that he had spent five months studying in Israel and had volunteered in the Israeli Army.  “The only way the ‘peace plan’ will be successful is if the Palestinians do not ruin it,” Mr. Shapiro wrote, adding, “Palestinians will not coexist peacefully.” During a news conference on Friday at Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, the nation’s first historically Black college or university, Mr. Shapiro tried to distance himself from those remarks, which were first reported by The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Trump is preparing to radically reshape the government. “Something I wrote when I was 20, is that what you’re talking about?” Mr. Shapiro told a reporter who asked him about it. “I was 20.” Mr. Shapiro said he had been in favor of a two-state solution, with “Israelis and Palestinians living peacefully side by side” long before the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7 that started the war in Gaza. ADVERTISEMENT “It is my hope that we can see a day where peace will reign in the Middle East,” he said, “where there will be a two-state solution, where all leaders involved in the conversations will respect the other side and show a willingness to make the hard choices to find peace.” Mr. Shapiro’s explanation did not satisfy the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which later on Friday called on him to apologize. “We are deeply disturbed by the racist, anti-Palestinian views that Governor Shapiro expressed in this article,” Ahmet Tekelioglu, the group’s executive director said in a statement. “We are also concerned by his failure to clearly apologize for those hateful comments, especially given how quickly and harshly he has targeted college students protesting the Gaza genocide for their speech.” In regards to Mr. Shapiro’s having written that he had volunteered in the Israeli army, a spokesman for Mr. Shapiro, Manuel Bonder, said in a statement: “While he was in high school, Josh Shapiro was required to do a service project, which he and several classmates completed through a program that took them to a kibbutz in Israel where he worked on a farm and at a fishery. The program also included volunteering on service projects on an Israeli army base. At no time was he engaged in any military activities.” Mr. Shapiro has been one of the most vocal party leaders to condemn the documented rise of antisemitism since the Hamas-led attack on Israel. When he was previously asked if he considered himself a Zionist, he said that he did. ADVERTISEMENT He has also not shied away from criticizing college administrators over their response to campus antisemitism, including at the University of Pennsylvania. If Ms. Harris chooses Mr. Shapiro to be her running mate, he will become only the second Jewish vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket. The first was Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Connecticut senator who died in March. He ran with Al Gore in 2000. Jon Hurdle and Katie Glueck contributed reporting.

Watch CBS News By Aimee Picchi Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: August 5, 2024 / 2:37 PM EDT / CBS News Former President Donald Trump is promising to eliminate taxes on Social Security, a vow aimed squarely at the 67 million Americans who receive monthly benefit checks from the retirement and disability program.  ""Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,"" Trump said at a Wednesday campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Such a pledge could be be a potent campaign plank at a time when poverty among seniors is on the rise, according to the National Council on Aging, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office has found millions of older workers are nearing retirement without a penny in savings. Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the agency. But cutting income taxes on Social Security income would ultimately harm the program by cutting off one of its funding sources – taxes — which in turn would likely hasten the insolvency of its trust funds, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. If that occurred, the Social Security Administration could be forced to make larger benefit cuts a year earlier than is now forecast.  ""It really is, in some ways, Trump advocating defunding Social Security,"" Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the program, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""It's a sleight of hand — it's giving with one hand and taking with another."" The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request for comment. Payroll taxes, the FICA taxes taken out of workers' paychecks, fund the bulk of Social Security. But about 4% of its financing stems from the income taxes that recipients pay on their benefits, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue to the program, according to the latest annual report from Social Security's board of trustees. While 4 in 5 Social Security recipients are senior citizens, the remaining beneficiaries are people who qualify for disability payments or are the children and spouses of deceased workers, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Social Security's funding issues have been years in the making, partially due to changing U.S. demographics. With baby boomers retiring in record numbers and seniors living longer, the program is increasingly strained by growing financial demands. Because of that shift, Social Security is now paying out more in benefits than it receives in income, which is eating away at the $2.7 trillion in assets held in its trust funds — the reserves that pay out retirement and disability benefits.  By 2033, the trust fund paying Social Security benefits is on track to be depleted, at which point the Social Security Administration would be forced to cut recipients' monthly benefits by 17%, according to the agency's latest report. Trump's proposal to nix income taxes on benefits would wipe out $950 billion in funding for Social Security over the next decade, according to a July 31 estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on fiscal policy.  That would have a twofold effect, pushing the program's insolvency date forward a year to 2032 and forcing the Social Security Administration to cut benefits even more deeply than it now predicts, the group said. Recipients would face a 25% cut in their monthly checks in 2032, the CRFB estimated. Cutting income taxes on Social Security could also potentially lead to funding shortfalls for Medicare, because a portion of those taxes are directed toward the program, the CRFB added. It estimates that Medicare would lose about $650 billion in revenue over the next decade, resulting in its potential insolvency being pushed forward by six years, from 2036 to 2030.  ""Freeing them from taxation is a kind of benefit increase, but [the Social Security Administration] has to get the revenue from somewhere else or the benefits would just be cut,"" Altman of Social Security Works told CBS MoneyWatch.  There is a misperception among some Americans that Social Security benefits aren't taxable, perhaps reflecting that such income wasn't taxable until 1984. But under changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, Social Security income above a certain threshold became taxable.  More seniors are subject to the tax each year because those thresholds haven't been adjusted for inflation since 1984, which means each year more middle-income beneficiaries are paying taxes on their Social Security checks. For instance, the share of seniors who paid taxes on their benefits was 26% in 1998, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That figure now stands at 40%.  Individual tax filers with combined annual income (Social Security and other income, such as retirement distributions or dividends) ranging from $25,000 to $34,000 may have to pay income tax on up to half of their benefits. Individuals with earnings of more than $34,000 may pay taxes on up to 85% of their Social Security income.  Joint filers with incomes between $32,000 and $44,000 may have to pay income tax on up to 50% of their benefits, while married couples with incomes over $44,000 may be taxed on up to 85% of their benefits.  For instance, a single filer who collects the average annual Social Security benefit of $22,884, but whose total income is $50,000, would be taxed on 85% of their benefits, or $19,451. Only $3,433 of their Social Security income would be tax-free. It's not the first time Trump has made a promise on the campaign trail to lower taxes for specific groups of people. The former president pledged in June to end taxation on tips for service workers, a move that experts said would cost $250 billion over 10 years.  Many seniors might like the idea of eliminating taxes on their benefit checks, Altman noted. Many older Americans feel like they're losing ground after years of high inflation, despite the annual cost-of-living adjustment that's applied to Social Security checks, she said. Trump's Social Security proposal could be designed to appeal to seniors who were put off by a proposal from the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservatives in the House, to raise the retirement age to 70 for both Social Security and Medicare, Altman added. Currently, the full retirement age for Social Security is 67, while seniors can qualify for Medicare at 65. ""They were really targeting Social Security, and seniors took notice,"" Altman said. Trump ""is throwing things out to try to win voters."" If Trump were elected, it's unclear whether his proposals to eliminate taxes on tips or Social Security benefits would come to fruition. For one, lawmakers would need to pass legislation to change the tax code, which could be a hurdle if either the House or Senate were to be controlled by Democrats under a second Trump administration.  Meanwhile, Trump hasn't yet released detailed plans for his tax proposals, unlike at this point in the 2016 race, according to Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.  ""Although Trump occasionally talks about eliminating the taxes on tips or lowering the corporate tax rate a little more, these are throwaway lines in his stump speech rather than firm costed proposals,"" Ashworth wrote in a report this week. ""At this point in the 2016 election race, Trump had a (relatively) detailed plan to cut taxes by a massive $7 trillion over the following decade.""

375|Days after objecting to it, Jaya Bachchan calls herself 'Jaya Amitabh Bachchan' in Parliament; leaves MPs in splits|"Days after objecting to it, Jaya Bachchan calls herself 'Jaya Amitabh Bachchan' in Parliament; leaves MPs in splits  Harvinder Singh creates history, becomes first Indian archer to win Paralympic gold     BOLLYWOOD Jaya Bachchan playfully referred to herself as 'Jaya Amitabh Bachchan' days after objecting to being called that in the Rajya Sabha Abhimanyu Mathur Updated : Aug 02, 2024, 11:04 PM IST In an amusing turn of events in the Rajya Sabha on Friday, Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan's self-introduction as 'Jaya Amitabh Bachchan' elicited a hearty reaction from Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar. The incident occurred after Bachchan, who had previously expressed discomfort with being addressed by her husband's name, playfully used it during a session. This unexpected twist led Dhankhar to burst into laughter, a reaction that was echoed by several other MPs, including Congress' Jairam Ramesh and Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) Raghav Chadha. The playful moment sparked a brief but humorous exchange between Bachchan and Dhankhar. Bachchan jested, ""Did you get a lunch break today? No? This is why you're taking Jairam Ji's name repeatedly. You cannot digest your food without taking his name."" Dhankhar responded in kind, saying, ""I'll tell you on a light-hearted note. I did not take a lunch break today but I had lunch with Jairam ji,"" which further amused the house. He said, ""I also want to tell you that this might be the first time that I am both yours and Amitabh Ji's fan."" This light-hearted exchange comes in the wake of Bachchan's earlier objection to being addressed as ""Jaya Amitabh Bachchan"" by Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh. On July 29, Bachchan firmly stated, ""Sir, only Jaya Bachchan would have sufficed,"" highlighting her concern about women being identified solely by their husband's names. During that session, Bachchan expressed her discontent, stating, ""This is something new, that women will be recognized by the name of their husbands like they have no existence or achievements of their own."" Jaya Bachchan, who has been an influential figure in both cinema and politics, married megastar Amitabh Bachchan on June 3, 1973. The couple has two children, Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan. The couple has acted in several films together, including Zanjeer, Sholay, Abhimaan, Mili, Chupke Chupke, Silsila, and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Since entering politics in 2004, she has been a vocal advocate for women's rights and various social issues.

383|In with a chance in Haryana, Congress looks to set house in order, unify warring factions|In with a chance in Haryana, Congress looks to set house in order, unify warring factions  Having been hampered by a lack of unity in recent years, the Congress in Haryana is trying to bring together it’s warring factions as it prepares to face the Assembly polls — likely to be held in October — at a time when the ruling BJP is facing a 10-year anti-incumbency on top of the disappointment of having lost half the state’s 10 Lok Sabha seats in June. Giving the Congress hope is Assembly segment-level polling data from the Lok Sabha elections, which show that if the Haryana polls were held today, although it would result in a hung House, the Opposition INDIA bloc would come out on top as an alliance. Attempting to strike a balance between various factions in the state unit, the Congress has constituted a 45-member “strategy committee” that has members of every faction. All top guns of its Haryana unit, as well as their close aides, are there in this list. Chaired by All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge Deepak Babaria, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Udai Bhan is its convener. Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda is a member of the committee along with 42 other leaders. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting in Haryana Bhawan, New Delhi, on August 10 when Hooda, Kumari Selja and other warring leaders could be seen on the same platform for the first time in years. However, Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Singh Surjewala, considered the leader of one of the factions, appeared cautious, telling The Indian Express, “I haven’t seen the constitution of this strategy committee and nobody has informed me about it yet. As such, I am busy in Parliament these days and it is likely the session will get extended. I will only be able to say something on it when I see what this committee is all about.” Selja and Surjewala are the only two Haryana Congress leaders who are also party affairs in-charge for Uttarakhand and Karnataka, respectively. Surjewala is also a member of the Upper House from Rajasthan. Former BJP Union Minister Birender Singh, who recently made a comeback to the Congress, has also been included in the list. Besides Selja, MPs Deepender Hooda, Jai Prakash, Varun Chaudhary and Satpal Brahmchari are part of this committee as are at least eight MLAs: Bharat Bhushan Batra, Aftab Ahmed, Geeta Bhukkal, Rao Dan Singh, Jagbir Malik, Jaiveer Singh Valmiki, Rajender Singh Joon, and Bishan Lal Saini. Others on board include several former ministers and MLAs, some of whom had been voicing out their concerns, such as former Deputy CM Chander Mohan: former ministers Sampat Singh, Anand Singh Dangi, Nirmal Singh, Karan Singh Dalal, Rao Narender Singh, Capt Ajay Singh Yadav; and former chief parliamentary secretaries Anita Yadav and Ram Niwas Ghorela. All three working presidents of the Haryana Congress — Jitender Kumar Bhardwaj, Ram Kishan Gujjar and Suresh Gupta — are also there. Talking about the balancing act carried out in the committee, Deepak Babaria told The Indian Express, “Everybody shall be on the same platform and their suggestions, party feedback, etc, shall be discussed in this meeting. It is basically constituted to discuss the party’s future campaigns, strategy, issues that we need to raise, when and where and how, areas where we need to focus, etc. All party leaders are welcome to share their vision, feedback and suggestions with the sole motive of strengthening the party’s ongoing campaign for the upcoming elections.” On the question of who among Bhupinder Hooda, Selja, and Surjewala would be participating in the strategy committee meeting, Babaria said, “Hopefully, they will all be there. I have always said that dialogue is the key to resolving differences. They should meet more frequently and discuss the issues. Deepender (Hooda) is not the brand ambassador of our ‘Haryana Maange Hisab (Haryana demands accountability)’ campaign. It is a party campaign and he is going wherever he has a clout, or wherever local leaders are calling him. Similarly, Kumari Selja is also taking out the Congress Sandesh Yatra, which is also the party’s campaign. Each and every leader of the party can get out and raise these issues in areas where they have a clout. The core issue is mobilisation of the party cadre, and the people. If anybody is calling another leader of having taken over a campaign, it is incorrect. In this committee, all Haryana Congress leaders have been included and their suggestions, on how to strategise the party’s campaign and strengthen it, shall be welcomed.” Regarding factionalism, Babaria said, “I must say that self-interest serves as a catalyst. If anybody has an aspiration of becoming the CM, he or she must have at least 20-30 MLAs on his or her side. For that, every ambitious party leader will need to work hard, mobilise party cadres to first ensure that the party wins a majority. Rest, the high command and senior leadership decides.” Bhupinder Singh Hooda told The Indian Express, “It is good that everybody has been included in this committee. Everybody shall give their suggestions on shaping the party’s strategy and campaign for the elections.” Other party leaders said the committee would only focus on election strategy and won’t have any role in selection of candidates for the Assembly polls.

384|"""Lyles loses heartbreaking 100m bronze by 0.005 seconds"""|"Noah Lyles wins gold for U.S. in 100m by 0.005 of a second   NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports!   SAINT-DENIS, France -- Since last August, Noah Lyles has stood firm and unequivocal in his belief that the title of ""world's fastest man"" belongs to him. On Sunday night at the Stade de France, he proved it. With a personal-best 9.784-second time that edged him past a world-class field full of elite sprinters, Lyles walked away with his first Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter final. He earned the victory by beating the man with the world's fastest time this year, Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, by 0.005 of a second. ""We were waiting for the names to pop up, and I'm going to be honest, I came over [to Thompson] and I was like: 'I think you got that one, big dawg!'"" Lyles said in his postrace news conference. ""Something said I need to lean, and I was like, 'I'm going to lean,' because it's that type of race."" It was the closest 100-meter final since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or perhaps ever. Back then, Great Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in 10.25 seconds in an era when timing didn't go down to the thousandths of a second. According to Omega, the official timekeeper of all Olympics events, at the 65.15-meter mark, Lyles hit his peak speed, and he was trailing at that point. That peak reached 43.6 km/h or 27.1 mph, and he maintained that rate the rest of the race. ""What's crazy is my [biomechanist] Ralph Mann, before I left for Paris, he's like, 'This is how close first and second is going to be away from each other,'"" Lyles said, holding his hand up with a narrow space between his index finger and thumb. ""I can't believe how right he was."" Lyles is the first American to win the celebrated race since Justin Gatlin in 2004. If Lyles makes the 200-meter finals Wednesday night, he'll have an opportunity to claim a second gold medal. Lyles' only other Olympic medal is a bronze, which he earned in the 200 at the Tokyo Games three years ago. Sunday's 100-meter final included the defending Olympic gold medalist at the distance, Marcell Jacobs of Italy; Thompson, the Jamaican who entered with the world's fastest time this year (9.77); and two of Lyles' American teammates, Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley. Kerley came in third, earning bronze in 9.81 seconds. Bednarek finished seventh, with a time of 9.88 seconds. Thompson's time in the final was only 0.02 of a second slower than what he posted at Jamaican trials earlier this summer. That blistering 9.77-second showing seemed a clear indication he would end up on the podium in Paris. ""I'm going to be disappointed, but I'm super happy and grateful at the same time,"" Thompson said. ""I just got to take it as what it is and just move forward from here."" It appeared Thompson was leading for much of the sprint, until Lyles bolted in across the final 10 meters. Even then, it seemed evident the race was heading toward a thrilling photo finish. ""I wasn't patient enough with my speed myself,"" Thompson said. During the semifinal round an hour and a half earlier, Team Jamaica appeared to put the rest of the runners on notice. Thompson's 9.80 semifinal sprint was the fastest of the round. Just behind him in a personal-record 9.81 seconds was fellow Jamaican Oblique Seville, who ran in a separate heat that included Lyles. Seville had history with Lyles, having faced him in the Bahamas in June. Seville won it, sneaking just past Lyles in 9.82 seconds. Lyles finished 0.03 of a second later. ""Going to Jamaica and getting beat by Oblique, and still saying I ran .85, and I'm still constantly moving forward and moving forward,"" Lyles said, ""I knew that when the time came for me to be able to say, 'This is the final, this is where I need to put it together,' I was going to do it."" It was after Lyles won the 100-meter world championship in Budapest, Hungary, last August when he began leaning into the ""world's fastest man"" nickname. ""Everybody knows that the title goes to the Olympic champion, and the world champion,"" Lyles said last week. ""Which, I am one of ... and soon to be another one of."" Those words proved to be prophetic. The Associated Press contributed to this story."|False|False

Ranvir Shorey and Sana Makbul had the most talked about rivalry in Bigg Boss OTT 3. The former housemates are in no mood to burry the hatchet and have gone on-record to speak against each other even after the reality show's finale. Ranvir, in a recent interview with Siddharth Kannan for his YouTube channel, responded to Sana's ‘male chauvinist’ comment and said being a girl doesn't give her the license to be unapologetic. (Also read: Ranvir Shorey alleges Pooja Bhatt's brother assaulted him, Mahesh Bhatt planted false stories: 'Painted me as abusive') Ranvir, reacted to Sana's remarks where she labelled him as a ‘sexist,’ and opined, “I believe Sana is a female chauvinist. You only get respect when you give it to others. Being a girl is not a license to misbehave and be unapologetic. When she told me something, I gave it back, so now she shouldn’t be crying over me disrespecting her.” He further said, “Initially, we got along very well, I used to lovingly call her Pookie. I felt terrible about commenting on her lips, but I didn’t know the dog incident. It started on a good note, but later when our fights began she would twist the topic and that caught on.” Sana, in an interview with The Indian Express had stated that, “Strong women are not appreciated and he is one of those male chauvinist kind of a person who doesn’t like it if women do better than him. I don’t want to say anything about him. I have buried it all. I don’t hold any grudge against him. But if he does that, it is his way of dealing with things.

File   Photo Credit: PTI NCP (SP) leader Supriya Sule on August 3 responded to Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar's denial of reports about him travelling to Delhi in disguise to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah when he was a opposition leader in Maharashtra and said she never levelled allegations. Mr. Pawar had said he would quit politics if the reports about his Delhi visit before the NCP forged an alliance with the BJP in 2023 were proven, and if not, those raising such allegations should quit politics. ""I never made allegations against anyone. I believe in constructive politics and policy-making. All news channels quoted Ajit Pawar as claiming how he would visit Delhi in disguise under a fake name before splitting NCP, during a media interaction at Sunil Tatkare's house in the national capital,"" Ms. Sule said. She said she was shocked that Mr. Pawar had visited Delhi in disguise to meet Mr. Shah at least “ten times” when he was the opposition leader. “When news channels in Delhi asked me about Ajit Pawar’s claims, I was shocked. I raised the issue of matching facial identification with Aadhaar on the DG app in Lok Sabha during question hour. I did not name any person,” she said. Reports published in a section of the media claimed that during an informal interaction held recently, Mr. Pawar revealed he used to travel to Delhi in disguise and meet Amit Shah on the alliance between the two parties (NCP and BJP). ""I used to wear a mask and a cap during air travel while going to Delhi to attend those meetings. I had also changed my name for air travel,"" reports quoted Mr. Pawar as saying. Latching on to this claim, the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP (SP) leaders targeted Mr. Pawar. However, talking to reporters in Nashik on August 2, Mr. Pawar said he believed in “playing open politics”. ""I am an activist who works in democracy. I don't have the habit of doing politics by hiding anything. However, opponents are targeting us with fake narratives and false news,"" he said. He said his opponents have resorted to such moves as they were shattered due to the good schemes being implemented by the Mahayuti government in Maharashtra.

The Modern Family star's LA residence was burglarised on Saturday, but it wasn't quite night yet, police sources told TMZ. According to officials' statement, the frightening break-in happened while it was still daylight out. Fortunately, Hyland was not directly at the receiving end of the alarming development as she is said to have been out of town when the crime broke out. Despite her in-person absence, she witnessed the incident as she caught masked individuals breaking into her place after getting an alert from her home security system. Per official claims, the suspects entered Hyland's property by breaking a glass window, alerting her security system. Even though Sarah was away from her sweet abode, she reportedly contacted the police after seeing the surveillance footage on her phone, which caught two masked men walking out of her LA home's front door.

Sources told the outlet that the place was as silent as ever by the time law-enforcement officials turned up. Police have yet to arrest any suspect under the ongoing active investigation. As the cops await Hyland's return, it remains unclear if anything valuable was looted from her crib. Sarah would have to conduct an inventory to cross-check possibly missing items and their worth. She's the latest victim to the long list of LA-based robberies this year after stars like Marlon Wayans and Bhad Bhabie's abodes suffered a similar fate. The Modern Family alum purchased the Los Angeles place before marrying The Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams. She reportedly spent $3.92 million to bag the modern farmhouse property in Studio City, California.

403|Today in Politics: Karnataka BJP begins march against ‘corrupt’ Siddaramaiah govt; AAP-LG reach yet another flashpoint|Today in Politics: Karnataka BJP begins march against ‘corrupt’ Siddaramaiah govt; AAP-LG reach yet another flashpoint  The BJP is going all out in its bid to corner the Siddaramaiah government in Karnataka. On Friday, BJP Karnataka president BY Vijayendra said the party was starting a seven-day padayatra (foot march) from Bengaluru to Mysuru on Saturday to take the fight against the Congress government to its “logical end”. The BJP has organised the march to raise further heat on Siddaramiah over the alleged Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) scam. The BJP has alleged that the CM’s wife Parvati was “illegally” benefitting from MUDA after the agency encroached on a parcel of land owned by her to create layouts. The BJP has also claimed that there was an irregularity in the purchase of land by her brother and also in the compensatory sites allotted by MUDA in exchange for the land. On July 26, Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot sent a show cause notice to Siddaramaiah on the scam. The Karnataka Council of Ministers on Thursday discussed the show cause notice. They alleged that it was a “gross misuse of the Constitutional Office’ of the Governor and said that a concerted effort was “being made to destabilise a lawfully elected majority government in Karnataka for political considerations”. While the BJP will use the march to hit out at the Congress government, there is a particular absence from the march that is causing the BJP discontent. Its ally in Karnataka, the Janata Dal (Secular), has publicly pulled out of the march. On Wednesday, JD(S) leader and Union minister HD Kumaraswamy declared that the party would not be part of the march, saying that many JD(S) leaders were not in favour of it at a time when people were battling rain-related issues. He also went on to accuse the BJP of “sidelining” the JD(S). Speaking to reporters in Delhi, the Union minister said: “In the region between Bengaluru and Mysuru, we (the JD-S) are strong. In this situation, if they do not take us into confidence in a proper manner, why should we support (the march)? The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Lieutenant Governor’s office in Delhi have reached yet another flashpoint. This time, the sparring occurred over the deaths of a woman and her child in East Delhi who had fallen into a drain after a downpour on Wednesday evening. On Friday, AAP leaders alleged that the drain was under the purview of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and demanded the resignation of the LG, who is the chairman of the Authority. The AAP has also announced a protest at the LG office on Saturday. The LG’s office shot back a letter in which it hit out at AAP leaders and said the drain was under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), which is under the Delhi government. “While this is undoubtedly another example of abuse typical of the AAP and its leadership, the fact of the matter is that the drain in which the unfortunate incident of drowning happened at Khoda colony belonged to the MCD under the control of AAP,” said the LG office. The 100-metre drain was neither desilted nor covered, it claimed. “AAP MP Sanjay Singh, MLA Kuldeep Kumar, party spokesperson Priyankar Kakkar and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), yesterday issued a patently false, deliberately misleading and blatantly improper statement holding the DDA responsible for the tragic death of a lady and her child by drowning and demanded the Hon’ble LG’s resignation. The same set of lies were again peddled today in a press conference by minister Gopal Rai and MLA Kuldeep Kumar,” the letter said. In a scathing attack on the AAP government, the LG office charged that the 10 years of “deliberate inaction, lack of development and worsening of civic infrastructure services” in Delhi “glossed over by rhetoric and hype generated through advertisements” was now getting “exposed”. The two-day Governors conference will continue on Saturday. On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Draupadi Murmu, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar and Union Home Minister Amit Shah addressed the programme. “In his address, the Prime Minister urged the Governors to play the role of an effective bridge between the Centre and the state and interact with people and social organisations in a manner to co-opt those who are underprivileged,” a press release issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan said. The conference, which ends on Saturday, “will cover a wide range of issues that play a critical role in not only shaping the Centre-state relations but also promoting welfare schemes for common people,” the release said. In her opening remarks, Murmu said it was crucial for the smooth functioning of democracy that various central agencies work with better coordination across all the states. She advised Governors to think about how they, as constitutional heads of their respective states, can promote this coordination. The PM will inaugurate the 32nd International Conference of Agricultural Economists (ICAE) in New Delhi on Saturday. This programme is being held in India after 65 years, an official statement said. The theme of the six-day triennial conference, organised by the International Association of Agricultural Economists, is Transformation Towards Sustainable Agri-Food Systems. The conference will witness participation of around 1,000 delegates from around 75 countries. — With PTI inputs Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates|True|True

JIMMY DAY, MIT MEDIA LAB By Nikk Ogasa MAY 23, 2023 AT 8:00 AM Deblina Sarkar makes little machines, for which she has big dreams. The machines are so little, in fact, that they can humbly inhabit living cells. And her dreams are so big, they may one day save your mind. Sarkar is a nanotechnologist and assistant professor at MIT. She develops ultratiny electronic devices, some smaller than a mote of dust, that she hopes will one day enter the brain. She’s also a fan of Kung Fu movies and likes to dance her own twist on bharata natyam, a classical Indian dance form. Occasionally she goes hiking with her graduate students, once taking them as far as Yellowstone. Building camaraderie is vital, Sarkar says. But “I’m probably working day and night on my research,” she confesses. “There is an urgent problem at hand.” That problem is Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological afflictions that assault the minds of millions of people worldwide. Sarkar’s solution: Employ minute machines to detect and reverse these disorders. “She was always interested in applying … electronics to biological systems,” says collaborator and bioengineering researcher Samir Mitragotri of Harvard University, who has known Sarkar for about a decade and was on her thesis committee. She envisions using her tools to “transform how people are conducting biology,” he says, “bridging the worlds.” Born in Kolkata, India, Sarkar credits both of her parents as early inspirations. Her boldness as a researcher comes from her mother, who as a young woman defied social norms in her village by working to fund her own education and speaking out against the dowry system. Meanwhile, Sarkar’s father sparked her fascination for engineering. At the age of 15, he abandoned his dreams of becoming an engineer to find other jobs; he needed to support his parents and the rest of his family after his father, an Indian freedom fighter, was shot in the leg and could no longer work. Still, Sarkar recalls her father finding time for his passion, fashioning devices to make home life more convenient. These included an electricity-free washing machine and vehicles that could freight hefty loads down local byroads to their house. “That got me very, very interested in science and technology,” Sarkar says. “Engineering specifically.” After earning a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Dhanbad, Sarkar moved to California to study nanoelectronics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. There, she tested new ways to create nanodevices that could reduce the amount of power consumed by computers and other everyday electronics. One standout device Sarkar developed during her graduate work was a transistor that reduced the amount of power lost as heat by 90 percent compared with some of today’s most common silicon transistors (SN: 3/18/22). For the breakthrough, UC Santa Barbara awarded Sarkar’s Ph.D. dissertation the Lancaster Award for its impact in advancing math, physical sciences and engineering. Along the way, Sarkar became fascinated with the brain, which she calls “the lowest energy computer.” A project imaging amyloid-beta plaques as a postdoc at MIT opened the door to fusing her dual interests, and she stayed on as an assistant professor to found the Nano-Cybernetic Biotrek group. Her group develops nanodevices that can interface with living cells, and “neuromorphic” computing devices, which have architectures inspired by the human brain and nervous system.   So far, the group’s most innovative device may be the Cell Rover, a flat antenna that could monitor processes inside cells. For a study reported in 2022, Sarkar and her colleagues used magnetic fields to finesse a Cell Rover, roughly the size of a tardigrade, into a mature frog egg cell. The team demonstrated that when stimulated by a magnetic field created by an alternating current, molecules in the nanodevice vibrated at frequencies safe for living cells. Using a wire coil receiver, the researchers were able to detect how those vibrations affected the device’s own magnetic field, thus showing it could communicate with the outside world. Cell Rovers could be outfitted with films that latch onto and detect select proteins or other biomolecules. Sarkar envisions using the device to spot misfolded proteins in the brain that may be early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Today, memory loss is the only way to know a living person has Alzheimer’s, but by then, the damage is irreversible, Sarkar says. Cell Rovers could also be paired with nanodevices that harvest energy from and electrically stimulate cells, opening the door for new types of brain electrodes and subcellular pacemakers. Or fleets of remotely controlled devices could replace invasive surgeries — detecting a small tumor growing in the brain, for example, and maybe even killing it. She’s essentially establishing a new field of science, at the intersection of nanoelectronics and biology, Mitragotri says. “There are many opportunities for the future.” One day, Sarkar hopes to insert nanodevices between human neurons to boost the computing speed of the fleshy processor already in our skulls. Our brains are remarkable, she says, but “we could be better than what we are.” Deblina Sarkar is one of this year’s SN 10: Scientists to Watch, our list of 10 early and mid-career scientists who are making extraordinary contributions to their field.

And I can tell you he came around a couple times.""  A second Megalopolis extra is speaking out about Francis Ford Coppola’s behavior on set. Lauren Pagone, who appeared as an extra in several scenes in the director's upcoming film, reportedly told Variety that she was kissed and hugged by Coppola while they were in the process of actively shooting a nightclub sequence for the sci-fi drama.  “I was in shock. I didn’t expect him to kiss and hug me like that,” the outlet quoted her as saying. “I was caught off guard. And I can tell you he came around a couple times.” Representatives for Pagone and Coppola did not immediately respond to Entertainment Weekly’s request for comment.  KRISTY SPAROW/GETTY Coppola was first accused of inappropriate behavior on set in a Guardian report back in May, which featured multiple unnamed sources who claimed the filmmaker ""tried to kiss some of the topless and scantily clad female extras” while shooting a nightclub scene. Last week, Variety published two videos taken by a cast member that appeared to show Coppola mingling with extras on set during a party scene including Pagone, who the outlet reported can be seen in one of the videos with her back toward the director before he allegedly hugs and kisses her. In the aftermath of Variety’s initial report, Rayna Menz — another Megalopolis extra who has also claimed to be featured in one of the two videos published by the outlet — told Deadline that Coppola “did nothing to make me or for that matter anyone on set feel uncomfortable.” Pagone told Variety that she chose to break her silence about the incident after Menz’s remarks, noting that she was unhappy that the fellow extra had decided to speak for the film’s entire cast and crew.  “I don’t appreciate anybody speaking for me. I would never speak for that actress,” she reportedly explained. “I’ve kept my mouth shut. I’ve kept quiet. But it’s frustrating that she’s putting out there, ‘Hey, it was great for everyone’ when she doesn’t know what other people were feeling. You can’t speak for anyone but yourself. My experience was different.” Megalopolis has been a 40-year-long passion project for Coppola, who self-financed its $120 million budget. Set in a reimagined version of the U.S., the film stars Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina, an ingenious architect who clashes with the evil Mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito) over how to best rebuild the metropolitan city of New Rome following a major disaster.

Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad explored the enzyme’s suitability for therapeutic applications.   Photo Credit: V. Praveen Kumar, LVPEI Scientists from the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, have developed an enhanced genome-editing system that can modify DNA more precisely and more efficiently than existing CRISPR-based technologies. CRISPR occurs naturally in some bacteria, as a part of their immune system that limits infections by recognising and destroying viral DNA. In Nobel-prize winning work, scientists repurposed this bacterial defence mechanism to develop a novel approach for editing the genomes of higher-order organisms. Today, using CRISPR-Cas9, researchers can add, remove or alter specific DNA sequences in the genome of animals. This system has been used in various fields, including in agriculture — to improve the nutritional value of plants and increase the yield — and in healthcare to diagnose several diseases and treat genetic disorders. The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool uses a guide-RNA (gRNA) designed to find and bind to a specific part of the target genome. The gRNA directs an enzyme, Cas9, to the target site, which is followed by a short DNA sequence called protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Cas9 recognises and binds to the PAM sequence, and acts as a molecular scissor that snips some damaged DNA. This automatically triggers the cell’s DNA repair system, which repairs the snipped part to insert the correct DNA sequence. But the CRISPR-Cas9 system can also recognise and cut parts of the genome other than the intended portion. Such “off-target” effects are more common when using the SpCas9 enzyme derived from Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Scientists have been able to engineer versions of SpCas9 with higher fidelity but only at the cost of editing efficiency. To overcome these issues, researchers are exploring Cas9 enzymes from Francisella novicida bacteria. While this Cas9, called FnCas9, is highly precise, it has a low efficiency as well. To enhance it without compromising its specificity, researchers led by Debojyoti Chakraborty and Souvik Maiti at CSIR-IGIB modified and engineered new versions of FnCas9. The researchers tinkered with amino acids in FnCas9 that recognise and interact with the PAM sequence on the host genome. “By doing this, we increase the binding affinity of the Cas protein with the PAM sequence,” Dr. Chakraborty said. “The Cas9 can then sit on the DNA in a stronger configuration, and your gene editing becomes much more effective.” The researchers also engineered the enhanced FnCas9 to be more flexible and edit regions of the genome that are otherwise harder to access. “This opens up more avenues for gene editing,” Dr. Chakraborty said. Experiments to measure enzyme activity showed that enhanced FnCas9 cut target DNA at a higher rate compared to unmodified FnCas9. CRISPR-based tools for diagnostics and therapeutics rely on the ability of the system to recognise specific single-nucleotide changes in the DNA. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. Each nucleotide consists of a nucleobase, a phosphate group, and a sugar. Each nucleotide in DNA has one of four nucleobases: adenosine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. A single-nucleotide change is when just one nucleotide in the genome needs to be ‘repaired’. When the researchers tested the ability of enhanced FnCas9 to identify such changes in the genome, they found enFnCas9 outperformed unmodified FnCas9. An enhanced FnCas9-based diagnostic could target almost twice the number of changes compared to FnCas9, increasing the scope of detecting more disease-causing genetic changes. Once Dr. Chakraborty’s team had shown the increased efficiency and activity of the enhanced FnCas9 enzyme, a team led by Indumathi Mariappan at the L.V. Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad explored the enzyme’s suitability for therapeutic applications. The researchers used enhanced FnCas9 to edit the genome of human kidney and eye cells grown in lab dishes. It not only edited genes in these cells at a better rate than did SpCas9, it also showed negligible off-target effects. The team finally sought to understand whether enhanced FnCas9 is a viable option for treating genetic disorders. They tested the enzyme’s efficiency at correcting a genetic mutation that causes Leber congenital amaurosis type 2 (LCA2), a form of inherited blindness. A single mutation in the RPE65 gene results in the loss of expression of a protein called retinal pigment epithelial-specific (RPE65), resulting in severe vision loss. The team isolated skin cells from an individual with LCA2 carrying the RPE65 mutation, and reprogrammed these cells to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Such cells can be made to grow into any cell type in the human body. When the researchers differentiated the iPSCs into cells of the eye’s retina, the cells expressed negligible levels of RPE65 protein. The researchers delivered a CRISPR system with the enhanced FnCas9 enzyme into the individual’s iPSCs to correct the mutation responsible for low levels of this protein. When they sequenced the edited cells, they found that the CRISPR tool had corrected the mutation. The edited iPSCs when differentiated into retinal cells also showed normal levels of the RPE65 protein. Dr. Mariappan said the team was taken aback by the efficiency of the editing. Most of the iPSCs carried the edits, and when the researchers grew colonies from individual edited iPSCs, they found that two colonies showed 100% mutation correction. “We also examined the whole genome for off-target interactions and found only a few, of no major concern, as compared to several hits seen with other Cas9 proteins [we] examined,” she added. Previous reports have suggested that such person-specific retinal cells can be transplanted back into a person to treat inherited blindness conditions like LCA2. A group of U.S. researchers reported on May 6, 2024, in the New England Journal of Medicine that CRISPR injected directly into the eyes of people suffering from LCA2 has shown success in early clinical trials. But editing patient-specific stem cells and transplanting the mutation-corrected cells into patients is a safer option, according to Dr. Mariappan, “because this allows us to screen and confirm precise edits.” “The research community needed this precision” in the CRISPR system, Shailja Singh, a researcher at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, who uses CRISPR-based tools to model and study genetic diseases like sickle cell anaemia and β-thalassaemia, said. Such reduced off-target effects are critical for those who use CRISPR-based therapy to correct mutations, “so this is a very welcome approach.” Dr. Singh added that while a precise enzyme without any off-target effects is much-needed, the delivery system must also be equally proficient. According to her, researchers should next focus on precisely delivering this tool into the nuclei of the target cells. Dr. Chakraborty said the team is working on adapting the system to different delivery methods as well as reducing the size of the enFnCas9. “All these will come in the following studies,” he said. The team is also in contact with some Indian companies to scale up and manufacture therapeutic solutions for multiple genetic disorders . “This opens up the doors for not licensing from a foreign entity, which could be very, very expensive.” Dr. Mariappan agreed: “With indigenous intellectual property for such a high precision editor, we are now in a better position to develop newer therapeutics at affordable costs for people in low- and middle-income countries like ours.” Sneha Khedkar is a biologist turned freelance science journalist. genetics Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Michael S. SchmidtAdam Goldman and Glenn Thrush In the summer of 2017, as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was starting his investigation, his agents and prosecutors were chasing potentially explosive allegations about foreign influence over Donald J. Trump and his campaign. C.I.A. intelligence relayed to the special counsel’s office suggested that senior leaders of a foreign power had signed off on secretly funneling millions of dollars — with the help of a Trump campaign adviser acting as “a bag man” — to Mr. Trump in the final days of the 2016 election. Interviews and other evidence obtained by the special counsel’s office showed that indeed Mr. Trump had lent his campaign a similar amount of money in the final days of the race — and, after beating Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump immediately struck a far more favorable tone toward the country than his predecessors. The country in question, however, was not Russia. It was Egypt. Seven years after Mr. Mueller’s team dug in on those allegations, people familiar with the investigation acknowledged that while much of the country’s attention was focused on ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, the most concrete lead Mr. Mueller’s team initially had about potential foreign influence over Mr. Trump involved Egypt. The people familiar with the inquiry discussed details of it on the condition of anonymity. ADVERTISEMENT While Mr. Mueller has often been criticized for not moving aggressively enough to investigate Mr. Trump’s personal and financial ties to Russia, his team took invasive steps to try to understand whether Mr. Trump or his campaign had received financial backing from Cairo. Mr. Trump’s foreign business ties and efforts by foreign interests and government to influence him have come under scrutiny again as he seeks to return to the White House. The little-known investigation into possible Egyptian influence shows both the intensity of past efforts to explore the issue and how they have fueled Mr. Trump’s long-running assertions that he has been subject to a “witch hunt.” Case Tracker: Trump is facing multiple criminal cases related to his business and political activities.

Trump on Trial Newsletter: Sign up here to get the latest news and analysis on the cases in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C. The Egypt investigation would outlast Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, which shut down in 2019. It was picked up by career prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, who closed it out in the summer of 2020 without pursuing any charges. No evidence has ever surfaced publicly that Mr. Trump or his campaign directly received Egyptian money. Details about the depth and breadth of the investigation have trickled out over the years. CNN laid out major elements of the investigation in October 2020, including that there was a secret legal fight between the Justice Department and an Egyptian bank. Investigators at the time were seeking bank records related to the matter, which ultimately ended up — under seal — being appealed to the Supreme Court. The Washington Post on Friday disclosed further details, reporting that five days before Mr. Trump took office in 2017 an organization linked to Egyptian intelligence withdrew $10 million in cash from a bank in Cairo — the same amount that the C.I.A. had been told was given to Mr. Trump in the final days of his campaign. The report about the withdrawal was confirmed to The New York Times by a person briefed on the investigation. ADVERTISEMENT The investigation started in the days after the 2016 election when the C.I.A. learned from a trusted confidential source that senior Egyptian leaders — including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi — had signed off on sending $10 million to Mr. Trump’s cash strapped campaign. The Egyptian leaders, investigators would be told, had in mind someone in Mr. Trump’s orbit to move the money: a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser named Walid Phares, who had frequently appeared on Fox News. Our politics reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. That includes participating in rallies and donating money to a candidate or cause. The F.B.I. opened an investigation into Mr. Phares, with investigators trying to understand whether he was “a bag man.” Mr. Trump’s first C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, was briefed on the details of the agency’s intelligence. In May 2017, Mr. Mueller was appointed special counsel after questions were raised about Mr. Trump’s attempts to interfere in F.B.I. investigations into his ties to Russia. Mr. Mueller was given a mandate to investigate Russia’s effort to influence the 2016 election and ties that four Trump campaign advisers had to Russia. What the public did not know at the time was that Mr. Mueller had also been given the job of investigating Mr. Phares and the intelligence suggesting that Egypt had sought to funnel money to Mr. Trump. ADVERTISEMENT Throughout the investigation, Mr. Mueller’s team was confronted with a range of allegations about Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. But, in the eyes of some agents and prosecutors working on Mr. Mueller’s team, the intelligence about Egypt was far firmer than anything they had related to Mr. Trump and Russia. At the time, Mr. Trump was threatening to fire Mr. Mueller, drawing a red line around his personal finances. But the evidence about Egypt allowed agents and prosecutors to convince Mr. Mueller to subpoena Mr. Trump’s bank records from the period of time during the campaign and just after the election that he might have received the money. The records were not helpful in corroborating the allegations, the people familiar with the investigation said. Some investigators wanted to continue digging, but Mr. Mueller stopped short of seeking the records from when Mr. Trump took office, leaving some investigators disappointed. Mr. Mueller’s investigators did devote significant resources to looking at Mr. Phares, who had told Trump campaign advisers that he could broker meetings between the Egyptian government and the campaign. Mr. Phares also took credit for arranging a September 2016 meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. el-Sisi, which investigators later examined. ADVERTISEMENT American intelligence agencies had learned what agents and analysts thought was potentially corroborating evidence: that there were questions atop the Egyptian government whether Mr. Phares could be trusted to deliver the money. The F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Phares on multiple occasions, learning new details such as his contacts with Egyptian intelligence officials. But despite Mr. Phares initial cooperation with the investigators, he eventually hired a lawyer and stopped talking. By 2019, Mr. Mueller’s team thought it had taken the investigation as far as it could. When Mr. Mueller’s Russia inquiry wound down, he referred the still-open Egyptian case to Justice Department prosecutors, who picked up where he left off. It was around that same time that U.S. officials learned of the $10 million bank withdrawal in Cairo by the group linked to Egyptian intelligence agencies, sparking more suspicions among investigators. In June 2020, The Times reported that the F.B.I. and special counsel’s office had investigated whether Mr. Phares had secretly worked for the Egyptian government to try to influence the incoming Trump administration. Mr. Phares declined to comment at the time and could not be reached on Friday. But that summer, prosecutors decided they had hit a wall and closed out the case. Michael S.

On Saturday, Kangana shared a morphed picture of Rahul Gandhi on her IG stories that showed him in a skull cap, with turmeric tika on his forehead and a cross necklace. She was taking a jibe at him for his recent remarks on caste census in the Parliament. Hours later, she was trending on Twitter for the ‘trolling’. (Also read: Kangana Ranaut calls Rahul Gandhi ‘pasta with kadi patta tadka’ amid his caste row with Anurag Thakur) With the picture, Kangana wrote, “Jaati jivi jise bina jaati pooche jaati ganana karani hai (He who wishes to hold a caste census without asking anyone's caste).” 'Kangana' is currently trending on Twitter with upwards of 20,000 tweets. Many have called her a ‘troll’ who is unfit for the Parliament. “This is an appeal to @siddaramaiah, @revanth_anumula and @mkstalin. Kangana Ranaut has shared shameful below belt morphed image of Rahul Gandhi on Instagram. This is the time she gets dragged in court, just an online FIR won't do the trick. This is absolutely sick from #KanganaRanaut and she just can't be left unpunished,” read a tweet.  “People are watching.. They'll give answer to your Hatred,” wrote another person. “Kangana Ranaut mocked Rahul Gandhi over the caste census, but she has had many flop films like *Tejas*, *Dhakad*, *Thalaivi*, and more. Given her own failures, she shouldn't troll others. Rahul Gandhi is a very popular leader and doesn't need defending,” read another tweet. “Shame on Kangana Ranaut 👎👎👎 What kind of manners your parents gave you. Please @INCIndia take action,” read another tweet. However, a few even supported Kangana and told her to keep such posts coming. Recently, Kangana shared old videos of Rahul invoking caste in public meetings on her Instagram stories. She wrote, “Apni jaat ka kuch ata pata nahi, nanu Muslim, dadi Parsi, mummy Christian aur khud aisa lagta hai jaise Pasta ko kadi patte ka tadka lagakar kichadi banane ki koshish ki ho, aur inko sabki jaat pata karni hai. (You know nothing of your own caste, your grandfather is Muslim, grandmother Parsi, mummy Christian and it feels like someone tempered pasta with curry leaves to make rice and lentils, but he wants to know everyone’s caste.)” She also added, “How can he be publicly ask people their caste in such a crude, condescending manner, shame on Rahul Gandhi.” Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused BJP MP Anurag Thakur of ‘insulting and abusing’ him in the Lok Sabha during the discussion on the Union Budget. BJP MP Anurag had said, “Those whose caste is not known, talk about the caste census.” without taking anyone’s name. He later stated, “I had said that someone who doesn't know about caste talks about census. I did not name anyone.” Rahul, who had promised a nationwide census if INDIA bloc came into power, replied, “You can insult me as much as you like but we will pass the caste census in Parliament. Anurag Thakur has abused me and insulted me. But I do not want any apology from him.”|True|True

Giving the Congress hope is Assembly segment-level polling data from the Lok Sabha elections, which show that if the Haryana polls were held today, although it would result in a hung House, the Opposition INDIA bloc would come out on top as an alliance. Attempting to strike a balance between various factions in the state unit, the Congress has constituted a 45-member “strategy committee” that has members of every faction. All top guns of its Haryana unit, as well as their close aides, are there in this list. Chaired by All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge Deepak Babaria, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Udai Bhan is its convener. Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda is a member of the committee along with 42 other leaders. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting in Haryana Bhawan, New Delhi, on August 10 when Hooda, Kumari Selja and other warring leaders could be seen on the same platform for the first time in years. However, Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Singh Surjewala, considered the leader of one of the factions, appeared cautious, telling The Indian Express, “I haven’t seen the constitution of this strategy committee and nobody has informed me about it yet. As such, I am busy in Parliament these days and it is likely the session will get extended. I will only be able to say something on it when I see what this committee is all about.” Selja and Surjewala are the only two Haryana Congress leaders who are also party affairs in-charge for Uttarakhand and Karnataka, respectively. Surjewala is also a member of the Upper House from Rajasthan. Former BJP Union Minister Birender Singh, who recently made a comeback to the Congress, has also been included in the list. Besides Selja, MPs Deepender Hooda, Jai Prakash, Varun Chaudhary and Satpal Brahmchari are part of this committee as are at least eight MLAs: Bharat Bhushan Batra, Aftab Ahmed, Geeta Bhukkal, Rao Dan Singh, Jagbir Malik, Jaiveer Singh Valmiki, Rajender Singh Joon, and Bishan Lal Saini. Others on board include several former ministers and MLAs, some of whom had been voicing out their concerns, such as former Deputy CM Chander Mohan: former ministers Sampat Singh, Anand Singh Dangi, Nirmal Singh, Karan Singh Dalal, Rao Narender Singh, Capt Ajay Singh Yadav; and former chief parliamentary secretaries Anita Yadav and Ram Niwas Ghorela. All three working presidents of the Haryana Congress — Jitender Kumar Bhardwaj, Ram Kishan Gujjar and Suresh Gupta — are also there. Talking about the balancing act carried out in the committee, Deepak Babaria told The Indian Express, “Everybody shall be on the same platform and their suggestions, party feedback, etc, shall be discussed in this meeting. It is basically constituted to discuss the party’s future campaigns, strategy, issues that we need to raise, when and where and how, areas where we need to focus, etc. All party leaders are welcome to share their vision, feedback and suggestions with the sole motive of strengthening the party’s ongoing campaign for the upcoming elections.” On the question of who among Bhupinder Hooda, Selja, and Surjewala would be participating in the strategy committee meeting, Babaria said, “Hopefully, they will all be there. I have always said that dialogue is the key to resolving differences. They should meet more frequently and discuss the issues. Deepender (Hooda) is not the brand ambassador of our ‘Haryana Maange Hisab (Haryana demands accountability)’ campaign. It is a party campaign and he is going wherever he has a clout, or wherever local leaders are calling him. Similarly, Kumari Selja is also taking out the Congress Sandesh Yatra, which is also the party’s campaign. Each and every leader of the party can get out and raise these issues in areas where they have a clout. The core issue is mobilisation of the party cadre, and the people. If anybody is calling another leader of having taken over a campaign, it is incorrect. In this committee, all Haryana Congress leaders have been included and their suggestions, on how to strategise the party’s campaign and strengthen it, shall be welcomed.” Regarding factionalism, Babaria said, “I must say that self-interest serves as a catalyst. If anybody has an aspiration of becoming the CM, he or she must have at least 20-30 MLAs on his or her side. For that, every ambitious party leader will need to work hard, mobilise party cadres to first ensure that the party wins a majority. Rest, the high command and senior leadership decides.” Bhupinder Singh Hooda told The Indian Express, “It is good that everybody has been included in this committee. Everybody shall give their suggestions on shaping the party’s strategy and campaign for the elections.” Other party leaders said the committee would only focus on election strategy and won’t have any role in selection of candidates for the Assembly polls.

The director, known for blockbuster spectacles such as RRR and the Baahubali movies, has revealed that his atheism remained unshaken even in one of the most testing times of his life. In the new Netflix documentary Modern Masters: SS Rajamouli, the filmmaker said that even some of the toughest personal tragedies couldn’t convert him into a believer, as he recalled when his wife, Rama Rajamouli, was injured in a terrible road accident in a remote location. The accident happened while while Rajamoulis was filming for the Ram Charan-starrer Magadheera. The filmmaker said that he “froze” after the accident, and began crying. He attempted to get in touch with every doctor that he knew, while his “wife bled profusely and was paralysed in her lower back from shock.” “The nearest hospital was 60 kms away. I was absolutely terrified. At the back of my mind a thought erupted, ‘Am I praying to God to help me?’ But I didn’t do that. I just frantically cried and kept calling doctors and kept doing what needed to be done. I think, at some point, I chose karma yoga as my way of life. My work is my god. I have huge respect for cinema,” he said in the documentary. The Netflix documentary also features his father, writer V Vijayendra Prasad, who revealed that Rajamouli’s lack of religious beliefs is never the cause of friction in the “heavily spiritually inclined” family. “For a person practicing atheism, there should be a high moral fiber in them. I have high respect for such a person,” he said. Modern Masters: SS Rajamouli is bankrolled by Applause Entertainment and Film Companion Studios.

Justin Simien is getting real about last year's Lando debacle. Three years after first being announced but with nothing to show for it, concerning news broke that the Simien-helmed, Donald Glover-starring Solo: A Star Wars Story spinoff series would instead be a movie. Since then, again, nothing. The radio silence resumed until Friday, when Collider published remarks from Simien indicating that Lando will not be moving forward. JONATHAN OLLEY /LUCASFILM LTD. Simien is on the road promoting Hollywood Black, an MGM+ docuseries based on the trailblazing book by scholar Donald Bogle examining race and representation in Hollywood. In an interview with Collider's Christina Radish, Simien vented his feelings over the saga of the stalled series. ""It was pretty developed,"" he shared. ""There was a Bible, there was concept art, there were scripts, but it just wasn’t meant to be."" Ever since the Star Wars cinematic universe expanded to the small screen, there have been so many shelved, canceled, and abandoned projects that critics write listicles and fans fill up Reddit threads discussing which they would have most enjoyed seeing. Simien is a part of a vast network of crestfallen creators, but the camaraderie hasn't soothed the sting. ""For me, it has to be done pretty straight on. Like, ‘I am in grief. I do not feel good.’ I have to let myself feel those feelings,"" he said. ""There’s so much that I experience that I get to keep forever and take into the next project. I can’t obviously take the storyline or the IP or the characters, but there’s so much more that I got, as a maker, and that’s mine. Sorry, it’s too late, you can’t take that part back."" Lando was first announced back in 2020 during a Disney investors' call. In a Star Wars era increasingly defined by backstory spinoffs, the move made perfect sense. Glover's Lando was the breakout star of Solo, and Simien was a rising star with three seasons of Dear White People, the series he created, directed, and wrote for Netflix, under his belt. Fans grew even more excited about the series when it was announced that Glover and his brother Stephen, the showrunner on Atlanta and a producer of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, would step in as co-writers. Exactly why Lando fell through the cracks at Disney+ is still unclear. Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. Simien remains undeterred, however, bringing Hollywood Black to MGM+ and looking forward a live-action Star Trek comedy series starring Tawny Newsome. The news was announced at the most recent San Diego Comic-Con, coming with the tagline, ""Federation outsiders serving a gleaming resort planet find out their day-to-day exploits are being broadcast to the entire quadrant.""

Ensemble and its allies are projected to secure between 150 and 180 seats, according to an IFOP estimate, behind the leading New Popular Front’s 180-215 result. Both factions have outpaced the winner of the first parliamentary vote, the far-right Rassemblement National — RN or National Rally. France now looks likely to be stranded in a hung-parliament scenario that divides it between three strongly represented parties that must broker alliances to gain absolute control. Attal, who stepped in as France’s youngest ever prime minister only in January, is unlikely to hold the country’s second-highest position as part of the upcoming administration. “Faithful to the Republican tradition and in accordance with my principles, tomorrow morning I will submit my resignation to the president of the Republic,” Attal said Sunday, according to a CNBC translation. “I know that, in light of the results of this evening, many French people feel a certain uncertainty about the future, as no absolute majority has emerged [in parliament]. Our country is experiencing an unprecedented political situation,” Attal added His departure was widely expected in the wake of the first presidential vote, when analysts had circulated the possibility that Macron would have to concede the prime minister’s office to RN leader Jordan Bardella, if the far right retained its advance. “From the beginning of this campaign, I was alerted to three risks: the risk of an absolute majority dominated by the France Unbowed, the risk of an absolute majority dominated by Rassemblement National, and the risk of the disappearance of a movement that embodies our ideas and our values,” Attal said Sunday night. “These three risks, today, were discarded by the French people. Tonight, no absolute majority can be led by the extremes.” In light of the run-off results, Attal set the scene for a period of transition for France’s political landscape: “Ladies and gentlemen, this evening, a new era begins. A new era for our nation,” he said. Faced with uncertainty in one of Europe’s forefront economies, markets will be following the next few days for indications of what alliances will forge to achieve ruling majority. France’s leadership is unlikely to be entirely dismantled in the wake of the elections, as Macron has previously indicated he would serve out the remainder of his term until 2027, irrespective of the outcome of the vote.

Hitting back at Union Home Minister Amit Shah for his ""Aurangzeb Fan Club' barb aimed at him, he dubbed the top BJP leader a political descendant of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the Afghan king who defeated the Marathas in the third battle of Panipat. Addressing party workers at the Shiv Sankalp rally here, he also accused the Eknath Shinde-led dispensation of bribing voters by giving ""revdis"" (freebies) to them in the form of schemes like the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin Yojana, under which eligible women in the state will get Rs 1,500 every month. Accusing the former ally of breaking parties, he said, ""If Muslims are with us after we explained to them our Hindutva, then we are (according to the BJP) the Aurangzeb Fan Club. Then what you are doing is power jihad."" During an event in Pune last month, Shah had attacked Thackeray and dubbed him ""the head of the Aurangzeb fan club"" who was ""sitting with people who sought pardon for 1993 Mumbai serial blasts convict Yakub Memon"". Referring to his remarks, Thackeray, who had challenged his friend-turned-adversary and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis that ""either you will be there or I will (in politics)"", said he was not referring to any person. ""Some people thought I challenged someone, but I don't challenge bed bugs. Here, 'I' means my cultured Maharashtra and 'you' means the party which loots Maharashtra,"" the former chief minister said. Bed bugs are not supposed to be challenged, but crushed, he said. Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi over photos of leakage in the new Parliament building, Thackeray said the new complex has started leaking in just 14 months. The PM asks what the Congress did in 60-70 years, but Modi should give an account on why the new Parliament building, which was built barely a year ago, started leaking, he said. ""This government (at the Centre) is a leakage government. There are paper leaks also,"" he said. Thackeray also accused the BJP of engineering division among castes. ""This is not the Hindutva taught to us by Chhatrapati Shivaji. This (the one practised by the BJP) must have been taught by Aurangzeb which we do not believe in. Our Hindutva is the one that takes forward the Maharashtra dharma of Chhatrapati Shivaji,"" he said. Taking a dig at the delay in getting judgement on disqualification of MLAs who rebelled against him, Thackeray said, ""We have faith in the judiciary. The result will be given in 5-50 years. The term of (the legislative assembly) is getting over. Even if they (the rebel MLAs) are disqualified, they can contest polls."" Thackeray added that democracy was getting murdered in broad daylight and stressed that justice will be delivered in the court of the people. Talking about the pothole-riddled roads during the monsoon, he hit out at Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari. ""Potholes are everywhere, including in Mumbai, Pune and other cities. Gadkari once said he will build such roads that even after 200 years there will be no single pothole on it. But looking at the condition of roads, Gadkari should be given the 'Khadde Purush"" (man of potholes) award. The Mumbai-Goa Highway is still under construction,"" Thackeray added.

95|Rajasthan tribal MP: ‘SC verdict will break unity among Dalits, Adivasis … if there is a big attack on quota in future, people won’t be able to resist’|Rajasthan tribal MP: ‘SC verdict will break unity among Dalits, Adivasis … if there is a big attack on quota in future, people won’t be able to resist’  Following the landmark Supreme Court judgment allowing sub-classification of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), Rajasthan’s INDIA alliance constituent Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) has announced its opposition to it. The party’s founder and Lok Sabha MP Rajkumar Roat, says sub-classification will lead to division within the SC-ST communities. Roat speaks to The Indian Express about why he thinks sub-categorisation will be divisive. Excerpts: * What is your take on the Supreme Court judgment? The situation of the SC-ST communities is different in every state. The manner in which this judgment was delivered, it (sub-categorisation) will serve to break up the unity among SCs and STs. If there is inequality in our state among STs, then our people, social organisations, MPs, and MLAs can sit together, decide, and submit a proposal to the government on what needs to be done. However, this SC judgment will break the unity among tribals and SCs. * Did any Rajasthan ST group demand sub-categorisation? There hasn’t been any such demand. In Rajasthan, there is indeed discussion on scheduled and non-scheduled areas when it comes to (jobs in) state services. But that can be resolved on the basis of the concerned areas, not by dividing the community. If you target the community then it will lead to conflict and that is what they (the BJP-led Centre) want. They are saying that they will give jobs to the weaker sections but how will they be identified? How will the government identify? * They also favour removing quotas for the creamy layer … Reservation has not been given for backwardness. The STs fought all the aggressors and it has been given based on their social identity. But the way they are defining it now (based on economic status) is incorrect. If this continues, reservation will be over in times to come. * What is your party’s position on the judgment? Our stand is that it has been brought for a particular community to fight within itself, which is wrong. We don’t support it. People in some remote areas haven’t yet received the benefit of reservation. Because of such cases, there can be a division of (existing reservation in) state services, between Schedule 5 and non-Schedule 5 areas, on the basis of population. Rather than target and divide communities, the division can be on the basis of the area. * It is said that some Rajasthan ST groups have received more reservation benefits than others… We do agree that this is true, but in Rajasthan, it can be addressed on a social level by the social and political leaders of the community. We will send such a proposal (to the state government). The government cannot identify that (because of political compulsions) but we can. * How do you see the judgment play out in the state? It will lead to divisions within SCs and STs and if there is a big attack on reservation in the future, then there may not be any struggle as the people won’t be able to resist it unitedly.

Last week, footage of the legendary director kissing extras on the set of his new dystopian drama surfaced months after he was accused of inappropriate on-set behavior. Two clips, reportedly taken by a crewmember and published by Variety, showed Coppola roaming around a dance floor scene in the film as he hugged and kissed female extras. Variety’s source claimed that after several takes, the director announced over a microphone: “Sorry, if I come up to you and kiss you. Just know it’s solely for my pleasure.” In a new report, one of the women in the video, Lauren Pagone, who appeared in multiple scenes in Megalopolis as an extra, said: “I was in shock. I didn’t expect him to kiss and hug me like that. I was caught off guard. And I can tell you he came around a couple times.” Coppola’s representatives did not immediately respond to The Independent’s request for comment. Pagone came forward after another of the extras denied that Coppola had been inappropriate on set. “He did nothing to make me or for that matter anyone on set feel uncomfortable,” Rayna Menz, who also appears in the video, told Deadline earlier this week. “I felt disgusted, I was blindsided by it because it was a closed set. That someone had video of that is just ridiculous and super unprofessional. It’s gross because he only ever spoke about how wonderful his wife is. His wife was on set with us, most days. It feels gross, seeing that video and they way they were trying to convey a message. Just gross.” She continued: “He was nothing but professional, a gentleman, he was like this cute Italian grandfather, running around the set,” she added. “It was just so much fun. He’s a nice generous person.” Pagone reportedly decided to speak out after reading Menz’s comments. “I don’t appreciate anybody speaking for me. I would never speak for that actress,” she told Variety. “I’ve kept my mouth shut. I’ve kept quiet. But it’s frustrating that she’s putting out there, ‘Hey, it was great for everyone’ when she doesn’t know what other people were feeling. You can’t speak for anyone but yourself. My experience was different.” In May, the day before Megalopolis had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, The Guardian published a report alleging “chaotic behavior” on the set, including Coppola reportedly “pulling women to sit on his lap” and “trying to kiss some of the topless and scantily-clad female extras.” Coppola denied the allegations, telling The New York Times in an interview: “I’m not touchy-feely. I’m too shy.” “My mother told me that if you make an advance toward a woman, it means you disrespect her, and the girls I had crushes on, I certainly didn’t disrespect them,” he said. Following a months-long search for a distributor, Megalopolis was finally acquired by Lionsgate in June and will be released in US and Canadian theaters on September 13. The dystopian drama, which received a mixed reaction from audience members at the premiere, stars Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina, an architect-scientist who wants to build a better version of a fictionalized New York City called New Rome. Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeouf, Giancarlo Esposito and Jon Voight also feature. Harper briefly remained in the game but was replaced by a pinch-hitter for his next at-bat.

Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union are planning to ask the full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review a panel ruling that struck down a key path for enforcing the Voting Rights Act. The ruling in an Arkansas redistricting lawsuit may set up the next U.S. Supreme Court fight that could further limit the reach of the Voting Rights Act's protections for people of color. The legal dispute is focused on who is allowed to sue to try to enforce key provisions under Section 2 of the landmark civil rights law, which was first passed in 1965. Private individuals and groups, who did not represent the U.S. government, have for decades brought the majority of Section 2 cases to court. Those cases have challenged the redrawing of voting maps and other steps in the elections process with claims that the voting power of people of color has been minimized. U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, ruled in February 2022, however, that only the head of the Justice Department, the U.S. attorney general, can bring Section 2 lawsuits and dismissed an Arkansas redistricting case brought by advocacy groups representing Black voters in the state. On Nov. 20, that lower court ruling was upheld in a 2-1 vote by a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose rulings apply to Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. ""For much of the last half-century, courts have assumed that [Section 2] is privately enforceable. A deeper look has revealed that this assumption rests on flimsy footing,"" wrote Circuit Judge David Stras, a Trump appointee, in the majority opinion joined by Judge Raymond Gruender, an appointee of former President George W. Bush. Chief Circuit Judge Lavenski Smith, another Bush appointee, dissented. ""Until the [Supreme] Court rules or Congress amends the statute, I would follow existing precedent that permits citizens to seek a judicial remedy. Rights so foundational to self-government and citizenship should not depend solely on the discretion or availability of the government's agents for protection,"" Smith wrote. Ultimately, many legal watchers say this Arkansas case may be appealed to the Supreme Court. This latest ruling comes after the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel filed a Section 2 lawsuit over Arkansas' state House map, arguing that it dilutes the voting power of Black people. According to the 2020 census, 16.5% of the state's population is Black. But only 11 out of Arkansas' 100 state House districts in the redistricting plan drawn by Republican politicians are majority-Black districts, where Black voters have a reasonable chance of electing a representative of their choice. In the trial court ruling dismissing the case, Rudofsky noted ""there is a strong merits case that at least some of the challenged districts"" in the GOP politicians' plan are ""unlawful"" under Section 2. Attorneys for the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel have said they're prepared to use another route for continuing this lawsuit under a federal statute known as Section 1983, which allows people to sue state government officials when their civil rights under federal law are violated. ""This decision is a devastating blow to the civil rights of every American, and the integrity of our nation's electoral system,"" said Barry Jefferson, political action chair of the Arkansas State Conference NAACP, in a statement. Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project, who is representing the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and other challengers of the Arkansas state legislative map, called the panel's ruling ""a travesty for democracy."" ""By failing to reverse the district court's radical decision, the Eighth Circuit has put the Voting Rights Act in jeopardy, tossing aside critical protections that voters fought and died for,"" Lakin added in a statement. But Arkansas state Attorney General Tim Griffin, whose office is defending the Republican politicians on Arkansas' apportionment board and the map they approved, said Monday's decision by the panel is ""a victory for our citizens and for the rule of law."" ""For far too long, courts across the country have allowed political activists to file meritless lawsuits seeking to seize control of how states conduct elections and redistricting. This decision confirms that enforcement of the Voting Rights Act should be handled by politically accountable officials and not by outside special interest groups,"" Griffin said in a statement. In a June ruling for a closely watched Alabama congressional redistricting case — which was filed by a group of Black voters in Alabama and other private groups — a majority of the Supreme Court justices reaffirmed the court's earlier rulings on how Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits racial gerrymandering in crafting political districts. Since then, a federal judge has struck down Georgia's congressional and state legislative maps and a 5th Circuit panel has concluded Louisiana's congressional map likely diluted Black voters' power — both in similar Section 2 lawsuits originally filed not by the U.S. attorney general, but by individuals and groups who do not represent the federal government.

The party’s founder and Lok Sabha MP Rajkumar Roat, says sub-classification will lead to division within the SC-ST communities. Roat speaks to The Indian Express about why he thinks sub-categorisation will be divisive. Excerpts: * What is your take on the Supreme Court judgment? The situation of the SC-ST communities is different in every state. The manner in which this judgment was delivered, it (sub-categorisation) will serve to break up the unity among SCs and STs. If there is inequality in our state among STs, then our people, social organisations, MPs, and MLAs can sit together, decide, and submit a proposal to the government on what needs to be done. However, this SC judgment will break the unity among tribals and SCs. * Did any Rajasthan ST group demand sub-categorisation? There hasn’t been any such demand. In Rajasthan, there is indeed discussion on scheduled and non-scheduled areas when it comes to (jobs in) state services. But that can be resolved on the basis of the concerned areas, not by dividing the community. If you target the community then it will lead to conflict and that is what they (the BJP-led Centre) want. They are saying that they will give jobs to the weaker sections but how will they be identified? How will the government identify? * They also favour removing quotas for the creamy layer … Reservation has not been given for backwardness. The STs fought all the aggressors and it has been given based on their social identity. But the way they are defining it now (based on economic status) is incorrect. If this continues, reservation will be over in times to come. * What is your party’s position on the judgment? Our stand is that it has been brought for a particular community to fight within itself, which is wrong. We don’t support it. People in some remote areas haven’t yet received the benefit of reservation. Because of such cases, there can be a division of (existing reservation in) state services, between Schedule 5 and non-Schedule 5 areas, on the basis of population. Rather than target and divide communities, the division can be on the basis of the area. * It is said that some Rajasthan ST groups have received more reservation benefits than others… We do agree that this is true, but in Rajasthan, it can be addressed on a social level by the social and political leaders of the community. We will send such a proposal (to the state government). The government cannot identify that (because of political compulsions) but we can. * How do you see the judgment play out in the state? It will lead to divisions within SCs and STs and if there is a big attack on reservation in the future, then there may not be any struggle as the people won’t be able to resist it unitedly.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sat down with Jane Pauley for a new interview that will air on CBS Sunday Morning on August 4, Meghan's 43rd birthday. In a preview clip released by the network on August 1, Meghan spoke about her desire to protect their two children, 5-year-old Prince Archie and 3-year-old Princess Lilibet, from harmful online content. ""Our kids are young — they're 3 and 5. They're amazing,"" she said with a smile. ""But all you want to do as parents is protect them."" ""So as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there's a lot of work to be done there, and we're just happy to be able to be a part of change for good,"" Meghan continued. Pauley then said, ""You hope that when your children ask for help, someone, you know, is there to give it."" Prince Harry, 39, chimed in, ""If you know how to help."" ""At this point, we've got to the stage where every parent needs to be a first responder,"" Harry continued.

KEVIN MAZUR/GETTY The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's Archewell Foundation has worked with families to provide a support network for parents dealing with grief or who have children managing serious mental health conditions as a result of their exposure to harmful online content. Their newly-announced trip to Colombia will take place ahead of the first World Ministerial Conference on the Elimination of Violence Against Children, being held in the South American country this November. Francia Márquez, Colombia's vice president and the first Black woman to hold the position, said in a statement, ""The conference will present a global framework for creating safer physical and virtual spaces, addressing issues such as cyberbullying, online exploitation and the impact of these threats on mental health. It will offer practical solutions and commitments for countries around the world. During their visit, the Duke and Duchess, as well as the Archewell Foundation, will take part in a number of activities related to this important topic."" KOLA SULAIMON/AFP VIA GETTY In February, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex expressed their support following the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on online safety for children in a statement published on the Archewell Foundation's website. “We applaud the bravery and determination of the thousands of parents around the country whose advocacy resulted in this hearing,"" they said. ""Over the past few years, we have spent time with many of these families, listening to their heartache and their hopes for the urgent change that is needed in the online space. This is an issue that transcends division and party lines, as we saw today at the Senate hearing. The best parenting in the world cannot keep children safe from these platforms. As one of the fathers shared with us: ‘If love could have saved them, all of our children would still be here.' This is not the time to pass the buck of responsibility. It’s the time to make necessary change at the source to keep our children safe."" Meghan has also spoken about being on the receiving end of online abuse. At the SXSW Conference in Austin, Texas, in March, she said there's a lot of work to be done to keep people safe online, adding that she finds it ""disturbing"" how ""much of the hate is women completely spewing it to other women."" She said that while there are advantages to social media and online space, platforms have ""quite a bit of hate and rhetoric and incentives people to create pages where they can churn out very, very inciting comments and conspiracy theories that can have a tremendously negative effect on someone’s mental health, on their physical safety.""

NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Peter Baker Peter Baker covers the White House and previously spent four years reporting from Moscow. Even in the world of presidential multitasking, July 21 turns out to have been an extraordinary, whipsaw Sunday for President Biden. At 12:09 p.m., he picked up the phone at his vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., to talk with the prime minister of Slovenia as part of a high-stakes diplomatic gamble to seal a complicated, multinational prisoner swap. Just 97 minutes later, he posted a world-stunning letter online abandoning his bid for re-election after a bruising pressure campaign by his own Democratic allies, climaxing the biggest crisis of his political career and signaling the end of his presidency after a half-century in public life. By any measure, it was one of the darkest moments of his time in elective office as the inescapable reality of time, age and polls finally caught up with him. And yet it would lead to one of the most joyous days of his presidency barely a week and a half later as he orchestrated the release of imprisoned Americans from the dungeons of Russia. ADVERTISEMENT For Mr. Biden and his team, the successful negotiation to free 16 people held by Russia on Thursday, including three American citizens and a U.S. permanent resident, offered sweet validation even as the clock is now ticking toward his final curtain call in office. When the president appeared with relatives of the liberated prisoners in the State Dining Room of the White House, it was clearly personal to him and he framed it as a mission on behalf of the larger American family. “My dad had a simple proposition: Family is the beginning, the middle and the end. Blood of my blood and bone of my bone,” Mr. Biden said before hugging the daughter of one of the freed prisoners. “I could think of nothing more consequential.” As he often does, he drew on his own experience of personal tragedy. “Having lost family,” albeit in a very different way, he said that bringing home these tortured souls now, well, “it matters, it matters.” It clearly mattered to him too. Although he made no mention of the incredible timing of his diplomatic triumph, just an hour and a half before his political surrender, it reinforced a commitment to making his last five months in power count. He may be a lame duck now, but he has no intention of heading off quietly into the night — except his trip late Thursday to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, where he welcomed home the Americans. Mr. Biden’s staff made a point of talking up his diplomatic deftness in brokering the deal, bringing together seven countries in the largest such swap since the Cold War. And they emphasized that he and his administration had helped free more than 70 Americans wrongfully detained abroad during his tenure. ADVERTISEMENT “This was vintage Joe Biden,” said Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. “If you had not had Joe Biden sitting in the Oval Office, I don’t think this would have happened.” Mr. Sullivan, who has been personally invested in bringing home the hostages for years and had to deliver bad news to their families on many occasions, grew teary-eyed himself in the White House briefing room. “Today was a very good day,” he said, choking up. It was Mr. Sullivan who set up the president’s critical call with Prime Minister Robert Golob of Slovenia on July 21, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share behind-the-scenes details. The day before, on Saturday, July 20, Mr. Sullivan had been in Colorado for a meeting of the Aspen Strategy Group and worked the phones to bring together the deal. He was talking with his counterpart from Slovenia, which had agreed in principle to release two Russians held by that Balkan country as part of the swap to free the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and the others held by Moscow.

But the two Russians would have to be pardoned, and the Slovenians said they could not do that in time, according to the U.S. official. So Mr. Sullivan asked if he could arrange a call from the president to the prime minister. After flying back to Washington, Mr. Sullivan called from his home that Sunday and connected the two leaders through the White House Situation Room, according to the U.S. official. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Biden was in isolation in Rehoboth recovering from Covid — and unknown to nearly the whole world, finalizing his letter withdrawing from the race. Even Mr. Sullivan, one of Mr. Biden’s closest advisers, had no idea what the president was about to do when he patched through the call and only learned later — and not from the president. During the phone call, which lasted just a few minutes, Mr. Biden implored Mr. Golob to facilitate the release of the two Russians in his custody. In making his pitch, Mr. Biden even offered to visit Slovenia, the U.S. official said. What Mr. Biden did not say was that he would only have a few months left in office to follow up on that idea. Mr. Sullivan, asked about the timing of the call shortly before the withdrawal, said it was simply happenstance. “That’s when the pieces were falling in place,” he said. It was hardly the only conversation Mr. Biden had during the months of haggling. He reached out personally to other foreign leaders, most critically Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, who for a long time had resisted releasing Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin convicted of murdering a Chechen separatist in Germany on state orders. ADVERTISEMENT But with Mr. Biden pressing him, and the prospect of winning the release of Aleksei Navalny, the most prominent Russian opposition leader who was in prison, Mr. Scholz finally relented. “For you, I will do this,” he told Mr. Biden in January, according to U.S. officials. Mr. Navalny died in prison a few weeks later, temporarily sabotaging the deal. But Mr. Scholz still went along with releasing Mr. Krasikov in the end and got five German nationals imprisoned in Russia in trade. “The deal that made this possible was a feat of diplomacy and friendship — friendship,” Mr. Biden said on Thursday. In a veiled reference to former President Donald J. Trump, who constantly berates and belittles America’s European partners, Mr. Biden added: “For anyone who questions whether allies matter, they do. They matter.” No longer facing another election might have made it easier on some level for Mr. Biden to risk whatever political fallout there might be for the swap. It was an uncomfortable compromise. No one liked giving up a killer like Mr. Krasikov for innocent Americans like Mr. Gershkovich, the Marine veteran Paul Whelan and the journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, along with Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian opposition leader and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Washington Post who is a permanent U.S. resident. ADVERTISEMENT Trading for hostages always raises the tricky question of whether it encourages the hostage-takers to do it again. Unsurprisingly, Republicans quickly made that point, most loudly Mr. Trump, who is seeking his old job back and denounced giving anything away to free American prisoners. “To do so is bad precedent for the future,” Mr. Trump wrote on his social media site in a posting that did not even pause to celebrate the freedom for the Americans and others released. “That’s the way it should be, or this situation will get worse and worse. They are extorting the United States of America.” But in fact, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sullivan decided early in his administration that the old politics no longer applied and that they should be willing to make trades, when justified, to free imprisoned Americans. For all the predictable criticism that would come, they concluded that there was really no meaningful domestic political cost, nor was it clear that refusing to make deals would necessarily stop hostage taking. In that case, they reasoned that it was better just to get Americans home rather than stand on what they considered a pointless principle and leave innocent people wasting away in foreign prisons or terrorist sanctuaries. They did so for Trevor R. Reed, an ailing former U.S. Marine held in Russia on what his family called bogus charges of assault, and they did so again for Brittney Griner, the W.N.B.A. star arrested in Moscow on what U.S. officials considered trumped-up drug charges. Left out of all those deals, though, was Marc Fogel, an American teacher sentenced to 14 years in a labor camp after being found with medical marijuana. Biden aides said they would keep trying to free him too. ADVERTISEMENT When Mr. Biden appeared on Thursday with the families of Mr. Gershkovich and the others, he laughed off a claim by Mr. Trump that if he were elected again, he would get President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to simply free American prisoners without receiving anything in return. “Why didn’t he do it when he was president?” Mr. Biden asked. With that, he headed out of the room. There was more to do. In fact, he had another important phone call to make, this one with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. There were, after all, more crises to confront, more hostages to try to free and not much time left. Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.

152|Cheesy pictures: gymnast’s parmesan photos take Olympics by storm|Cheesy pictures: gymnast’s parmesan photos take Olympics by storm  Giorgia Villa won silver with Italy in the women’s team final. But her passion for parmesan has also gained attention T hree years ago Italian gymnast Giorgia Villa was cruelly denied her first shot at Olympic glory when she injured her ankle less than two weeks before getting on the plane for Tokyo. On Tuesday, the 21-year-old from Brescia helped Italy to their first medal in artistic gymnastics since 1928, teaming with Angela Andreoli, Alice D’Amato, Manila Esposito and Elisa Iorio to win a historic silver behind the United States. The Italian quintet have become overnight celebrities back home, where they have been dubbed le fate d’argento (the silver fairies). But Villa’s profile has managed to transcend gymnastics in the days since her landmark medal thanks to a viral tweet which unearthed her endorsement deal with parmesan cheese. The images speak for themselves. There’s Villa posing in her leotard next to a wheel of parmesan. There’s Villa seated proudly with three wheels of parmesan, performing an aerial cartwheel over a wheel of parmesan, doing the splits on four wheels of, yep, parmesan. There’s Villa giving a warm embrace to her “best friend” – you guessed it – a wheel of parmesan. More than 20 sponsored posts across Villa’s social media channels have featured her showing off wheels, blocks and bite-size packets of the hard cheese. Olympic silver medalist and Italian gymnast Giorgia Villa is sponsored by parmesan cheese and takes many of her photos while posing with large wheels of cheese pic.twitter.com/klx8PEuFPN Three months before the Tokyo Olympics, Villa signed a sponsorship deal with the Parmigiano Reggiano Consortium (PRC), the association which oversees production and unites all producers of the cheese. A press release hailed the partnership as “confirming how the combination of Parmigiano Reggiano and the world of sport is indissoluble in terms of authenticity, quality and energetic value, both in sporting activity and in correct nutrition”. She is not the first athlete to get in bed with Big Parma. According to the Italian marketing agency Impresa e Sport, Parmigiano Reggiano has also partnered with current world No 1 men’s tennis player Jannik Sinner, former NBA point guard Nico Mannion and Paralympic swimmer Giulia Ghiretti and the fencer Matteo Neri. The association boasts that Parmesan cheese, which is made through a manufacturing process dating to the 13th century, is “suitable for a sports diet”. Some health experts agree, describing it as “easy digested, for the presence of ready to use proteins and lipids, lactose free, rich in calcium, with possible prebiotic and probiotic effect”. Villa’s mother signed her up for gymnastics lessons “before I destroyed her whole house” due to her high energy and activity level. “I had just started nursery school, but I immediately understood that I would love that sport with all my being,” she said. “I left school and, still wearing my pink apron, I couldn’t wait to enter that gym and jump and run feeling free and happy.” Since the age of 11 she has been schooled at the Italian Gymnastics Federation’s International Academy of Brescia, training six days a week. Villa no doubt caught the eye of the PRC’s power brokers after the 2019 world championships where she competed on all four apparatus to lead Italy to a surprise bronze, the country’s first team medal since 1950. No longer able to compete in the all-around due to a recurring back injury, Villa’s clean uneven bars routine on Tuesday played no small part in Italy’s historic medal. But it’s Villa’s magnetic enthusiasm that has enamoured the throngs of media who have packed the Bercy Arena over the past week. She could hardly contain her excitement after Sunday’s qualifying round, where she performed before a celebrity-flecked crowd that included Tom Cruise, Lady Gaga, Jessica Chastain, Ariana Grande and Anna Wintour. “Biles and her teammates are fabulous gymnasts, what can I say?” Villa said. “Simone is from another planet. Seeing her vault and all her acrobatics from so close up is a unique privilege.” It was unclear at time of writing which cheese variety Biles prefers.|True|True

Amidst felicitations from Janasena leaders and well-wishers, Pawan Kalyan, the first-time minister representing the Pithapuram assembly constituency, is set to dive into his new role. The Deputy Chief Minister is scheduled to engage in review meetings with senior officials later in the day. Assigned by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu earlier this week, Pawan Kalyan is entrusted with the responsibilities of Panchayat Raj and Rural Development, Rural Water Supply, Environment and Forests, and Science and Technology portfolios. Following his victory over his rival Vanga Geetha from the YSR Congress Party in the recently concluded state polls, Pawan Kalyan secured the Pithapuram assembly seat by a significant margin of over 70,000 votes. Having achieved a remarkable 100 per cent success rate in both assembly and Lok Sabha elections, the Janasena Party, in alliance with the TDP and BJP, emerged victorious in all 21 assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats contested. The NDA coalition, comprising these three parties, collectively secured 164 out of 175 seats, with the TDP clinching 135 seats and the BJP securing 8 seats. Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Pawan Kalyan as a force to reckon with, describing him as a ""storm"" during his remarks on June 7. Despite initial hesitance due to his busy acting commitments, Pawan Kalyan ultimately decided to join the cabinet, driven by a sense of responsibility towards fulfilling electoral promises, as revealed by a Janasena leader in a statement to the Hindustan Times. Having founded the Janasena Party in March 2014, Pawan Kalyan's journey into mainstream politics reflects upon his ministerial role, symbolising a new chapter in his mission for bringing in societal change and development in Andhra Pradesh.

Banerjee recently intervened to resolve a stalemate between directors and technicians over the boycott of the shoots of director Rahool Mukherjee. On July 30, actors Prosenjit Chatterjee and Dev along with filmmaker Goutam Ghose met Banerjee in an attempt to resolve the deadlock as studios remained closed and several shooting projects remained on hold after technicians refused to work on a film Mukherjee is directing. The director is currently facing a three-month ban imposed by the Federation of Cine Technicians’ Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) for allegedly violating the industry’s norms by employing Bangladeshi technicians on a previous project. The stand-off escalated last Saturday when technicians walked off the set of Mukherjee’s new film, leading to a show of solidarity from other directors who ceased work on Monday in protest. The industry remained divided, with prominent figures such as Prosenjit and Anirban Bhattacharya supporting Mukherjee, while technicians stuck to their positions. However, soon after the meeting between the industry veterans and the CM, the standoff was resolved and shooting in Tollygunge’s studios resumed on Wednesday. Both Chatterjee and Dev, who is a Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP, expressed gratitude to Banerjee for her support and expressed confidence about a swift resolution of the issue. Time and again, Banerjee and her party have swayed the Bengali film industry by making legislators out of film stars while rewarding many film personalities with awards. Sources said Banerjee knows very well that being surrounded by celebrities fetches her party easy votes. “The trend of celebrities joining political parties and getting involved in active politics exists across the country. This is no different. Mamata Banerjee cares for film personalities and wants to further develop the industry. The state government has always given them priority. Therefore, she has nothing but the best interest of the film industry in mind,” said a TMC insider. Bengali film and television stars dominate the stage of most state-sponsored cultural events, because Banerjee promotes them, inviting them to attend her party meetings and rallies and using their star quotient for political purposes. Over the years, the TMC’s annual Martyrs’ Day rally in Kolkata on July 21 has become a star-studded affair, with Bengali film stars occupying front-row seats on stage. Ahead of this year’s Lok Sabha polls, Banerjee appeared in the popular Bengali TV show “Didi No 1” as part of her outreach campaign. Its host Rachana Banerjee is the current TMC MP from Hooghly. Not just Rachana or Dev, Mamata over the years has handpicked actors and actresses to win crucial seats in Lok Sabha and Assembly elections — from established actors such as Tapas Pal, Shatabdi Roy, Debashree Roy, Moon Moon Sen and Chiranjeet, to stars from the younger generation such as Dev, Mimi Chakraborty, Nusrat Jahan, and singer Aditi Munshi. The trend has continued in recent years with more celebrities such as director Raj Chakraborty, actors Soham Chakraborty, Sayantika Banerjee, Saayoni Ghosh, June Maliah, and Kanchan Mullick joining the party and winning elections; not to mention her roping in of heavyweights such as Shatrughan Sinha and Babul Supriyo from the BJP. Apart from political positions, The TMC government has also bestowed honours on industry names who are close to it. Since 2012, the Mamata government has been conferring the Mahanayak Samman and other awards to Bengali film and television personalities “for outstanding contributions in the world of cinema”. This year, the CM has conferred the Mahanayak Samman on Bengali Rachana Banerjee and singer Nachiketa Chakraborty. Prosenjit Chatterjee was given a special award for his contribution to the Bengali film industry over the last four decades. Actors Subhasis Mukherjee, Ambarish Bhattacharya, and Rukmini Moitra received special awards.

A single cookie will be used in your browser to remember your preference not to be tracked. The Alpine Formula One team have confirmed Oliver Oakes as their new team principal. Oakes founded Hitech Grand Prix in 2015, which has competed at the forefront of major junior motorsport series such as Formula Two and Formula Three. The team had expressed an interest in joining the Formula One grid for 2026 but proved unsuccessful. The Brit replaces Bruno Famin who revealed he would be stepping away from the day-to-day running of the Formula One team from August at last weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix. Famin initially came on board on an interim basis before being confirmed as the permanent replacement for Otmar Szafnauer when a lack of suitable replacements appeared, so a long-term option was always expected to be found. “It is a pleasure to welcome Oli to the team and for him to become one of the youngest team principals that this sport has ever seen,” said de Meo. “This team is being built for future success and this is highlighted by Oli’s appointment in a senior role. We look forward to harnessing his enthusiasm, energy and passion for racing and realising that mindset across the entire team.” Oakes added: “I am extremely grateful to Luca de Meo and Flavio Briatore for this opportunity to lead BWT Alpine F1 Team back to competitiveness. “The team has talented people and excellent resources at its core, and I am confident that we can accomplish a great deal together during the remainder of this season and the longer term. I look forward to getting started after the summer break.” Oakes’ first race in charge of Alpine will be the Dutch Grand Prix at Circuit Zandvoort from 23rd to 25th August.

236|Britain’s Labour pulled off a thumping election victory with just 34% of the national vote|Britain’s Labour pulled off a thumping election victory with just 34% of the national vote                                                                                                                      LONDON — The U.K.’s Labour Party won a huge parliamentary majority in the country’s general election, but a quirk of the British electoral system means it did so with just 34% of the total votes cast. Results show that the opposition Labour Party has won 412 parliamentary seats of the total 650, with just two seats yet to be declared. This translates as roughly 63% of the total seats, but Labour has won just 34% of the total “popular” vote, while the Conservative Party has secured nearly 24% of that number. Meanwhile, smaller parties including the centrist Liberal Democrats, right-wing Reform U.K. and the Greens took nearly 43% of the popular vote but gained just less than 18% of the seats available. This was aided by the U.K.‘s “first past the post” system, where voters choose only one single candidate from their local list in each of the country’s 650 constituencies. The person with the most votes in each constituency is elected as a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons, the U.K.’s lower house. The party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons usually forms the new government and its leader becomes prime minister. Unlike in other voting systems, there are no second rounds or ranking of first- and second-choice candidates, meaning it can be difficult for smaller parties to translate an increased share of the popular vote into parliamentary seats. Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at AXA Investment Managers, said in a note released Friday that this election “marks a warning sign for the political system, [as] a large majority has been delivered on a little more than a third of the popular vote.” She pointed out that voter turnout was just 60% for this election. That represents the second-lowest turnout rate since 1918, after 2001, when turnout fell to 59.4%. This 7.6% fall in turnout from 2019 indicated a “broader political disconnect,” said Dickens. “The scale of Labour’s majority is as much an outcome of the peculiarities of our voting system and an interplay of split votes and the [collapse of the] Scottish National Party (SNP), rather than of a resurgence in Labour’s popularity,” she said. That said, Dickens added that the “vote has shifted to the left more generally.” “If the Labour government can govern over the next five years and deliver a recovery in economic growth, investment and individuals’ real incomes they should be well placed ... to see a genuine improvement in the future,” she said. Meanwhile, Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Marcoeconomics, said that investors will need to “chew over how the vote shares, right-wing Reform’s results, and voters’ willingness to shift political allegiance translates into policy.” Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party won 14% of the popular vote, securing just four seats. Wood said: “Normally a majority as large as Labour’s would guarantee more than one term as government. But Mr. Starmer’s majority is not as secure as normal given the voting dynamics.” He said that Labour “will likely need to move fast with policy changes to demonstrate they can deliver their promised changes.” — CNBC’s Jenni Reid and Holly Ellyatt contributed to this report.

The latter was a title Bigg Boss OTT 3 winner Sana Makbul had given to him during an exclusive conversation with Indianexpress.com. Now weeks after the show’s finale, Ranvir Shorey reacted to these remarks from Sana in an interview with Siddharth Kannan. The actor called her a female chauvinist and pointed out how she misbehaved with him on the show time and again. Ranvir said, “I believe Sana is a female chauvinist. You only get respect when you give it to others, being a girl is not a license to misbehave and be unapologetic. When she told me something, I gave it back, so now she shouldn’t be crying over me disrespecting her. Initially, we got along very well, I used to lovingly call her Pookie. I felt really bad about commenting on her lips but I didn’t know the dog incident. It started on a good note, but later when our fights began she would twist the topic and that caught on.” Also Read: Bigg Boss OTT 3 winner Sana Makbul calls Ranvir Shorey a ‘male chauvinist’: ‘Doesn’t like it if women do better than him’ Ranvir Shorey also went on to add, “I tried to clear the air about me being against her, but she kept twisting things. One blatant example was when she clearly hinted at being the baharwala to Vishal and didn’t own it up later. She didn’t have the grace to apologize. There are a lot of women I respect, I don’t need to prove it to her. She brought up my son in the middle of a task and this was after she knew that we were not getting along. I hoped she would apologize, but she gave me attitude instead.” In an exclusive interview with Indianexpress.com Sana Makbul said, “Strong women are not appreciated and he is one of those male chauvinist kind of a person who doesn’t like it if women do better than him. I don’t want to say anything about him. I have buried it all. I don’t hold any grudge against him. But if he does that, it is his way of dealing with things. When I stepped out from the Bigg Boss house, I let the bygones be bygones. It’s all over for me.” Further reacting to Sana’s accusations of Ranvir getting intimidated by strong women, the actor said, “How would she know? She is not a very strong woman. She doesn’t know what a strong woman is.” The Bigg Boss OTT 3 second runner-up also shared how the contestants never had any major complaints with him. It was all personality conflict, “A lot of them had preconceived notions, I never did that. They came with the idea to fight,” Ranvir added.|True|True

296|Amid pushback against ‘non-locals’, Meghalaya Cabinet gives in to pressure|Amid pushback against ‘non-locals’, Meghalaya Cabinet gives in to pressure  Verifying “criminal antecedents” of migrant workers and a twenty-fold increase in fines for their non-registration — these are some of the major changes that the Meghalaya Cabinet approved to an existing law on Friday as the state witnesses a massive pushback against non-locals. According to Meghalaya government spokesperson Paul Lyngdoh, amendments to the Meghalaya Identification Registration Safety and Security of Migrant Workers 2020 and the rules for the implementation of the Act were among the various topics discussed at the Cabinet meeting on Friday. Among these changes is increasing the fine for non-registration of migrant workers to Rs 1 lakh from the current Rs 5,000, Lyngdoh said after the meeting. The Act itself defines migrant workers as a person “not belonging” to Meghalaya and who is not domiciled in the state but seeks employment in the state and excludes “any work ordinarily involving research or is managerial, administrative or supervisory capacity, etc”. It mandates that every such “migrant worker” be registered with the state government, which will issue them a Registration Card, and places the responsibility for this registration on the person employing or engaging them. The Cabinet decided to adopt a system to “ensure that only those with no criminal antecedents can join the workforce as migrant workmen” in Meghalaya, Lyngdoh said. The Indian government’s Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System is to be used for this, with police and labour departments coordinating in its implementation. “These amendments will be introduced in the state assembly in the upcoming (autumn) session,” Lyngdoh said. The session is to be held from August 23-30. These announcements come against the backdrop of growing pressure from various organisations in the Khasi hills for the implementation of an Inner Line Permit in the state and tighter regulations for those entering the state. Last month, the Khasi Students’ Union claimed that 2,500 workers found “without valid documents” were “pushed back” from the state. There were also reports of migrant workers being assaulted. Following a meeting with KSU on July 19, Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said that while there was no system of “work-permits” in Meghalaya, the state will “strictly” enforce its registration system.

Scott Simon NPR's Scott Simon talks with Robert Shrimsley of the Financial Times about the election in the UK, when the incumbent Conservative Party lost badly.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Britain has a new prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer. His Labour Party won a landslide election victory, while the Conservative Party, which had held power for 14 years, suffered its worst-ever defeat. And outside 10 Downing Street, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak offered an apology.  (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)  RISHI SUNAK: To the country, I would like to say, first and foremost, I am sorry. I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change.  SIMON: Robert Shrimsley is a U.K. chief political commentator and executive editor at the Financial Times. He joins us from London. Mr. Shrimsley, thanks so much for being with us.  ROBERT SHRIMSLEY: Hi there.  SIMON: Historic defeat for the Conservative Party. What happened?  SHRIMSLEY: Well, a number of things happened. First of all, it's important to remember they'd been in office for 14 years. No British government has ever won five consecutive election victories on the bounce. So the odds were stacked against them. On top of which, they'd been very difficult years. We had a period of austerity, which saw big cuts to public services. We had Brexit, which was obviously terribly divisive. And then, in the wake of the pandemic and the Ukraine war, we've had bad inflation, the cost of living crisis and further strain on public services.  On top of that, we had two prime ministers, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, who alienated the public. Boris Johnson by holding - his Downing Street staff holding lockdown parties during the COVID pandemic, having set a rule for everybody else - his people didn't obey themselves. And then Liz Truss, who was very briefly prime minister, held a disastrous mini-budget, which shattered the Conservatives' reputation for economic confidence. So all of those things together meant that the country was just fundamentally sick of them.  SIMON: And politically, were they outmaneuvered on the right by Nigel Farage and the Reform Party?  SHRIMSLEY: It certainly didn't help that you had this split on the right, which ate terribly into their vote. I mean, historically, in Britain, there has only really been one important party of the right, and that's the Conservatives. Whereas, the parties of the left have been split between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats in particular. Well, this time, there was a major party of the right, which took 14% of the vote and did untold damage to the Conservative Party across the country. The question that's not entirely clear and we'll only begin to understand in the months ahead is whether that's a permanent feature now or whether that was simply a manifestation of the anger felt by former conservatives, and those people might over time be coaxed back.  SIMON: Parties on the right seem to be in ascendance in much of the rest of Europe, notably, of course, with France. I wonder, did that affect the Conservative Party?  SHRIMSLEY: Well, I think the point is that there's been an anti-incumbency element to what's going on across Europe, and obviously, the incumbents in Britain were the Conservatives. Therefore, the natural alternative historically has always been the Labour Party. The question now is whether Britain's Conservative Party, which has been a broad coalition of right-wing groups or sort of moderate right moving rightwards - whether that now becomes more like some of the parties that you're seeing in the European Union or, indeed, in the Republican Party in America, whether they move towards being that more nationalistic radical right grouping or whether they attempt to stay as a sort of broad coalition.  SIMON: How do you see the Tories remaking themselves?  SHRIMSLEY: That's an extremely good question and one that we're all watching with interest. And there will be a big debate now. They've lost a lot of leaders in this election. So a lot of people who might have been potential leadership contenders have lost their seats. There will be a big debate as to the real causes of their defeat. Those on the right will argue that they lost because they opened up space for Nigel Farage. They betrayed conservative principles, and they need to get back to them and take his votes from him.  Others in the mainstream will say they essentially lost because they lost their reputation for competence, for governing well and because people in Britain were not feeling better off. That's the debate that's got to be had. And, of course, there's a bit of truth in both. I veer very much towards the second explanation that, fundamentally, they lost because the country thought they were doing a very bad job and was fed up with them.

The coalition further called on Beijing to “cease all material and political support to Russia’s war effort,” specifically naming the transfer of “dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia’s defence sector” — in NATO’s first explicit accusation that the administration of Xi Jinping is providing military aid to Moscow. “It’s the first time that NATO allies state this so clearly in an agreed document,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a Wednesday address. “It cannot continue like this without it impacting the interests and reputation of China.” NATO has been deeply entrenched in its support for non-member Ukraine since the dawns of Russia’s invasion, widely viewing Moscow as a potential threat to broader European security. Beijing has previously repeatedly denied supplying weapons to Russia in the war in Ukraine, but the two nations have maintained close trade relations throughout the conflict, even as Moscow finds itself increasingly divorced from or outright sanctioned by the West. A CNBC analysis last year found that Moscow was at the time sourcing semiconductors and other advanced Western technologies through intermediary countries, including China. Earlier this week, Beijing started joint military exercises with Russia’s close ally Belarus at a training ground mere miles away from the Polish border, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said in a Google-translated Telegram post. The territory of Belarus previously served as a launching pad for Russia’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine. On the February 2023 first-year anniversary of the Ukraine war, China — which a month later successfully capitalized on goodwill earned as a trade partner to broker a reconciliation between arch-enemies Iran and Saudi Arabia — pitched a peace framework for the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv. It, like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s peace plan and Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin’s own recent conditions to ignite diplomatic negotiations, has so far failed to gain traction. Earlier this week, China was the third stop in the world tour of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a crucial Putin ally who debuted his self-declared “peace mission” to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. After visiting Ukraine and Russia, Orban met with Xi in Beijing, praising China as a “key power” to resolve the hostilities. After years of a velvet-gloved diplomacy and approaching China as a distant concern, NATO on Wednesday said Beijing “continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security,” underscoring the alleged disinformation stemming from the world’s second-largest economy and its activities in space and cyberspace. Back in March, NATO members the U.S. and U.K. accused China of a years-long cyberespionage campaign against politicians, businesses and journalists. The practices exposed “China’s continuous and brash efforts to undermine our nation’s cybersecurity and target Americans and our innovation,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said at the time. In response, the Chinese embassy to the U.K. condemned Britain’s “sinister action.” “The UK’s claim that China was responsible for malicious cyber campaigns targeting the U.K. is completely unfounded and constitutes malicious slander,” it said at the time. NATO also raised alarms over China’s alleged nuclear ambitions. “The PRC continues to rapidly expand and diversify its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems. We urge the PRC to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions and promote stability through transparency,” the NATO communique said, warning that allies are simultaneously raising their “shared awareness” and enhancing preparations to protect against China’s “coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.” The Federation of American Scientists estimates that China has a total inventory of 500 warheads as of March — a mere 9% of the arsenal of Russia, which possesses the largest nuclear capabilities after inheriting the reserves of the former Soviet Union. “China is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country,” Hans Kristensen, associate senior fellow at the Stockholm International Peach Research Institute said back in June, when the institute released its yearly publication analyzing world nuclear powers. “The Chinese nuclear stockpile is projected to continue growing over the coming decade and the number of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) is likely to reach or even exceed the numbers held by either the Russian Federation or the United States,” SPRI found last month. CNBC has reached out to China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a scathing riposte, China’s mission to the European Union said that the NATO statement “hypes up China-Russia relations undercutting and reshaping the rules-based international order” and is “filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric.” It added, “The China-related paragraphs are provocative with obvious lies and smears. We firmly reject and deplore these accusations and have lodged serious representations with NATO.” The NATO comments to China come after the leaders of several Indo-Pacific countries — such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea — are attending the Washington NATO summit, according to Reuters, extending a practice that began after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

File   Photo Credit: The Hindu Days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s “Aurangzeb fan club” remark, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief and former Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray labelled the BJP leader as a political scion of the 18th-century Afghan ruler, Ahmad Shah Abdali. He accused Mr. Shah of indulging in “power jihad” by splitting political outfits to form new governments. “If Muslims are with us after we explain our Hindutva, then we are (as per BJP) the Aurangzeb fan club. In that case, what you are up to is nothing but power jihad,” Mr. Thackeray said. On July 21, while speaking to BJP workers about the upcoming Assembly elections, Mr. Shah dubbed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) as the Aurangzeb fan club and said Mr. Thackeray was its leader. He had also claimed that Nationalist Congress Party (SP) chief Sharad Pawar was the “godfather of corruption who institutionalised graft in India”. Mr. Thackeray’s response was an attempt to set a counter-narrative as the Afghan king had defeated Marathas in the third battle of Panipat. The 18th century ruler had made as many as nine attempts to invade India. Referring to the tension unfolding around caste-based reservation in Maharashtra, he said that this was the kind of Hindutva that must have been taught by Aurangzeb and practised by the BJP. Chhatrapati Shivaji’s Hindutva, however, was different and would be the one to take the State forward, he added. Equating his former ally BJP to bedbugs, Mr. Thackeray said that bedbugs were supposed to be crushed and not challenged. “Either you will be there or I will...Some people (Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis) thought that I challenged them but I don’t challenge bedbugs. ‘I’ means the cultured Maharashtra and ‘you’ means the political party that loots the State,” he said. Hitting back at these statements, Mr. Fadnavis said that Mr. Thackeray was a disappointed and frustrated person, whose mind was badly affected and his latest speech only confirmed that he was very much a member of the Aurangzeb fan club. politics / Maharashtra / politics (general) / national politics / Shiv Sena-Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray / Bharatiya Janata Party Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

324|"""The Pennsylvania governor, a top contender to be Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, wrote in his high school yearbook that Israelis were 'too peace-loving.'"""|No, Josh Shapiro Wasn’t Snubbed for VP Because He’s Jewish      Republicans and some journalists are pushing the cynical and false narrative that antisemitism doomed Shapiro’s candidacy. Governor of Pennsylvania Josh Shapiro speaks at a rally for Kamala Harris and new vice presidential candidate Tim Walz in Philadelphia on August 6, 2024. On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that she was picking Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. This meant that she was not picking Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, and who had drawn the ire of progressive critics during the two weeks of veepstakes over his support for Israel and attitude toward anti-Israel protesters. After the news of Harris’s decision broke, people began speculating about why Shapiro had been snubbed. One theory quickly gained traction: that his Jewishness had doomed him. The New York Times offered, “Vice President Kamala Harris faced a difficult choice when it came to Israel and her running mate: Selecting Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania could mollify many Jewish voters and other centrists over a subject that has bedeviled the Biden-Harris administration for nearly a year, Israel’s war in Gaza,” and argued that antisemitism was surging on the left. On CNN, Van Jones spoke of “antisemitism that has gotten marbled into this party” and asked “how much of what just happened is caving into these darker parts of the party.” Republicans were all too happy to take this line and run with it, with former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump telling Fox News that he had “very little doubt” that Shapiro wasn’t chosen “because of the fact that he’s Jewish, and they think they’re going to offend somebody else.”  Let us, for a moment, put aside that, in this same interview, Trump once again said that American Jews who don’t vote for him—which, to this point, has been roughly two-thirds of American Jews—should have our “heads examined.” Let’s ignore Trump’s long history of pushing antisemitic conspiracy theories related to Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist George Soros; his history of embracing white nationalist figures and Holocaust deniers. and that he reportedly praised Adolf Hitler. And let us move on from the fact that, if not picking a Jewish running mate means a person is antisemitic, Trump, too, is guilty of that charge, since his running mate is JD Vance, who is Catholic.  Let us do this so that we can focus on the story that not choosing Shapiro was an act of antisemitism. And it is just that: a narrative, one as cynical as it is fictional.  Firstly, by all accounts, the reason that Harris chose Walz over Shapiro is that she thought Walz would be a better fit with and for her. He was reportedly charming and, importantly, more deferential in his interview, whereas Shapiro, per one account, seemed to be negotiating the parameters of the job. It is not difficult to understand why a person who is running for president instead of her older boss might take the person who says he has no greater ambitions over the obviously extremely ambitious person who is 10 years her junior.  But secondly, while I do not doubt that there were some people in this wild and varied country of ours who did not prefer Josh Shapiro because he was Jewish, I have to note that, to the extent that Shapiro was criticized from the left, it was not only for his support for Israel—as some noted, all of the candidates under consideration support the state to varying degrees (though, in fairness, critics of Israel might feel differently about someone who volunteered for the Israeli military and worked briefly for the Israeli Embassy)—but because the place where he stood out was where support for Israel bumped up against American democratic principles.  It is true that all of Harris’s VP finalists support Israel; but it is not true that all of them called for a university president to be fired, or appeared to liken campus protesters to the KKK, or urged law enforcement to be sent in to break up protests. (In the interest of full disclosure, I wrote a piece expressing concern that picking Shapiro could undercut Harris’s message of freedom, since freedoms of expression and assembly are core to the American project. I am Jewish, and while I know some might consider this a self-hating argument, I do not. I am also quite confident that this essay was not why Harris picked Walz.) In other words, it wasn’t on the matter of Israel that Shapiro was seen as more concerning; it was on the matter of our own democracy. (Although, to Eli Cook, a senior lecturer at the University of Haifa, writing in the Israeli outlet Haaretz, it was also about Israeli democracy: Shapiro had accepted money from Jeff Yass, who also reportedly donated to Kohelet, the think tank behind Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul.) A politician shouldn’t be put under extra scrutiny because they’re Jewish, but neither is Jewishness a reason not to scrutinize their positions, particularly on as important an issue as Gaza.      It is also perhaps worth noting that, before news broke that Walz was the pick, certain right-wing pundits were saying that Shapiro was attempting to scrub away his Jewishness after he tried to offer context for an article he wrote when he was 20 in which he described Palestinians as “battle-minded” (the context was that he was 20). For example, right-wing podcaster Ben Shapiro tweeted, “Josh Shapiro desperately trying to un-Jewish himself to make himself sufficiently palatable to the pro-Hamas wing of the Democratic Party. Pathetic,” suggesting that, even if Shapiro had been the pick, conservative voices would still have said that the Democratic Party is full of antisemites and their Jewish enablers, by which, again, they mean the majority of American Jews.  I can understand that some American Jews might be disappointed that Shapiro wasn’t picked. It can be exciting to see parts of yourself represented by political figures; American Jews have been in this country since before it was a country, and I can see how some or many American Jews would be thrilled that, after all those hundreds of years, a person who is so proud of his Jewishness might live at Number One Observatory Circle, closer than any Jew has ever been to the presidency. The only other Jewish running mate on a major party ticket in American history, Joe Lieberman, lost; I can understand the excitement that maybe this time would be different and Shapiro would win. But there is simply no evidence that antisemitism was the reason Walz was the pick and Shapiro wasn’t. And it is dangerous and counterproductive to the fight against antisemitism to pretend otherwise. Antisemitism is a real force in American politics and life today. It’s shown up everywhere from shooters’ manifestos to politicians’ tweets to Jewish cemeteries vandalized with swastikas. There’s no need to pretend that it’s also responsible for a person’s not getting a job. There’s no need to go along with those who decry antisemitism in one breath and peddle it in the next. And there’s no need to embrace a bad-faith narrative pushed by the Republican Party, which spreads antisemitism while claiming to care about the fight against it.

Today he studies how they’ve shaped human evolution and history. COURTESY OF D. BLANCO-MELO By Pratik Pawar NOVEMBER 14, 2023 AT 9:00 AM Smallpox, measles, mumps. These are among the contagious diseases that European colonists likely brought to the Americas at the turn of the 16th century, prompting the collapse of Indigenous populations. But the exact viruses that caused the millions of deaths remain unknown. Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks to solve that historical puzzle. An evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, he uses cutting-edge tools to study ancient viruses and illuminate how they have shaped human evolution and history. In recent work, Blanco-Melo and colleagues reconstructed two viruses circulating in Mexico at the time of European colonization. “Our research on ancient viruses is really appealing to the curiosity of the people and how we can study history,” Blanco-Melo says. But this work also holds personal meaning for Blanco-Melo as someone who was born and raised in Mexico. Through genetic sleuthing, he is able to study “something that is very dear in my heart,” he says, “really understanding, with molecular biology, those historical events.” Blanco-Melo’s obsession with viruses bloomed in high school when he had a chance encounter with Matt Ridley’s book Genome. Blanco-Melo had bought it as a Father’s Day gift for his dad but ended up reading it himself. Later, with encouragement from his biology teacher, he enrolled in an undergraduate program in genomics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, campus in Cuernavaca. He had his first encounter with ancient viruses as a Ph.D. student at the Rockefeller University in New York City. His research focused on particular viruses called endogenous retroviruses, remnants of past infectious viruses that have become integrated into a host’s genetic instruction book. Blanco-Melo first cataloged the genetic remains left behind by an ancient retrovirus called HERV-T that spread among our primate ancestors tens of millions of years ago. Further analysis revealed that a gene responsible for producing the virus’s outer envelope stuck around throughout primate history; even modern humans retain an inactive version. This gene encodes the envelope protein that helps the virus enter and infect a cell by interacting with another protein on the cell surface. Why would such a viral gene be so well preserved, Blanco-Melo wondered. What kind of evolutionary advantage could it have offered? Based on studies of cells in a lab dish, he hypothesizes that ancient primates must have co-opted the viral gene and used the related protein to get rid of the cell surface protein, essentially blocking the virus’s entry into cells. This example highlights how a virus’s own genetic material, over the course of evolution, can be used against it. “This project not only satisfied my curiosity, but we were able to push it into a full-blown story of how a virus evolved, emerged, but also how that virus ceased to exist,” Blanco-Melo says. Perhaps today’s researchers can exploit similar strategies to combat current retroviruses — “the big goal being HIV,” Blanco-Melo says. More recently, Blanco-Melo has teamed up with María Ávila-Arcos, an evolutionary geneticist at UNAM and an old friend, to study viral epidemics that largely wiped out Indigenous populations in the Americas. Blanco-Melo, Ávila-Arcos and a team of researchers extracted and isolated viral DNA from skeletal remains that they dated to somewhere between the 15th and 17th centuries. These remains come from mass graves at a colonial hospital and a chapel in what is now Mexico City. Archaeological and hospital autopsy records suggest that the remains in the graves belonged to Indigenous people and enslaved Africans who were victims of epidemics that occurred during the 1540s and 1570s. Based on those findings, the team reconstructed the genetic instruction books of two viruses not previously known to be circulating at that time — human parvovirus B19 and a human hepatitis B virus. The study, published in 2021 in the journal eLife, is perhaps the first to obtain ancient viral sequences from the Americas, says Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutch who wasn’t involved in this work. “Knowing about the ancient viruses that were infecting people hundreds of years ago is of great scientific and historical interest throughout the world, but especially of interest in the Americas,” Bloom says. The team found that the ancient viruses were similar to contemporary African strains. They “seem to have arrived in Mexico shortly after the European arrival,” Blanco-Melo says, “but they did not come from Europe. They came from Africa, basically through the transatlantic slave trade.” Through the collaboration, Blanco-Melo has been careful to avoid helicopter research, where outsiders come to a place, get the data and take credit for the resulting work. “These samples should stay in Mexico, should be analyzed by Mexican researchers … and all those results are, of course, going to be communicated back into the communities. That’s our goal,” he says. Though the two viruses the team identified aren’t likely to have caused massive epidemics, they could have exacerbated some of the symptoms of other diseases. Ongoing projects based on the same samples from Mexico are looking for other viruses and even peptides to get a fuller picture of the viruses from that time — and perhaps pin down big culprits. “There’s a lot more research that needs to be done in order to capture those other causative agents,” Blanco-Melo says.

'Don't become like me...': Why Infosys founder Narayana Murthy said this to a 12-year-old   BOLLYWOOD Kriti Sanon's fans have rallied behind her over the recent viral video that appeared to show her smoking Abhimanyu Mathur Updated : Aug 01, 2024, 10:39 PM IST Kriti Sanon is currently in Greece vacationing with friends and family. The actress rang in her 34th birthday in the Mediterranean nation last week. But things soured after a video of hers purportedly smoking there went viral. Many trolls attacked the actress calling her a hypocrite given that she had vehemently stated she is anti-smoking in earlier interviews. Now, a section of the internet has come out in Kriti’s defence, slamming trolls for invading her privacy and filming a private moment. The video appears to show Kriti sitting by the oceanside smoking a cigarette. The video has been shot from far and does not show with clarity what the actress is holding. However, fans said that it need not be a concern even if she is smoking. Reacting to the video, one Twitter user said, “Let her live her life and enjoy her vacation. What is the fuss here I don't know.” A comment on Reddit added that what she does in her private life should not be criticised. “Ehh who cares? As long as she's not promoting it, she can do whatever she wants in her private life,” read the comment.  Many actually slammed the person who shot and posted the video online, arguing that it constitutes an invasion of privacy as the actress was in her private space at the time. One fan asked, “Is it okay to click pics without permission??? She isn't in some media promotion event, it's her private life.” Many supported this argument. One comment read, “Just because they're famous, doesn't mean you're not going to respect their personal space or invade their privacy. They don't owe us that.” Kriti Sanon was last seen on screen in the comedy heist film Crew. Not only was the film a box office success but the actress also  impressed everyone with her performance in. Kriti will be next seen in the movie Do Patti, which is also produced by her. The film marks her second collaboration with Kajol after Dilwale and is currently under production. The DNA app is now available for download on the Google Play Store.

Investors are worried after Friday’s jobs report showed U.S. employers pulled back on hiring in July. (AP video: Joseph B. Frederick)                     NEW YORK (AP) — Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index soared nearly 11% early Tuesday, a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street. The Japanese index advanced more than 3,300 points, not quite making up for the huge loss of more than 4,400 points the day before, when it plunged 12.4% in its worst single-day decline since 1987. The scary Monday started with a plunge abroad reminiscent of 1987 ’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S. economy. The S&P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt. The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week, and it was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation. Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday. Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.  That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.89%. “The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.” Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part “because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major financial imbalances.” Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits. “Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.” The only way for stocks to look less expensive is either for prices to fall or for their profits to strengthen. Expectations are still high for the latter, with growth for S&P 500 profits this past quarter looking to be the strongest since 2021. Professional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world. Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market. Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “ Magnificent Seven ” had propelled the S&P 500 to record after record this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market. But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines. Apple fell 4.8% Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker. Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the poster child of Wall Street’s AI bonanza, fell even more, 6.4%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia’s new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia’s gain for the year to nearly 103% from 170% in the middle of June. Another Big Tech titan, Alphabet, fell 4.4% after a U.S. judge ruled Google’s search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. All told, the S&P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to 16,200.08. Worries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That’s adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things. Wall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself. The threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy. “It comes down to jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy. “When we get to election day, the unemployment rate is going to be extremely important.” AP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach, Matt Ott, Christopher Rugaber and Damian J.

397|Australia stunned hosts India in Ahmedabad to win the men's Cricket World Cup for a sixth time.|"Cricket World Cup 2023: Australia stun hosts India to win sixth title as Travis Head hits century  Australia beat India to win their sixth Cricket World Cup ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final, Ahmedabad: India 240 all out (50 overs): Rahul 66 (107), Kohli 54 (63); Starc 3-55 Australia 241-4 (43 overs): Head 137 (120), Labuschagne 58 (110) Australia won by six wickets Scorecard Australia stunned hosts India in Ahmedabad to win the men's Cricket World Cup for a sixth time. Australia quietened the wild support from the 100,000-strong home crowd by dismissing their previously unbeaten opponents for 240 before Travis Head's sensational century meant they romped to victory with seven overs to spare. After their bowlers expertly took advantage of a slow pitch, Australia were themselves reduced to 47-3 as India hit back in an electric new-ball spell. But Head and Marnus Labuschagne calmly weathered the storm with a stand of 192 as Indian hope drifted away from the world's largest cricket stadium. Head was caught for 137 from 120 balls with just two runs needed, but Glenn Maxwell flogged the winning runs a ball later while Labuschagne ended 58 not out from 110. The superb victory means Australia extend their record as the most successful side in 50-over World Cup history and now sit four titles clear of the rest of the pack. It also caps a six-month period in which they beat India to win the World Test Championship and retained the Ashes in England. India, meanwhile, were left crestfallen as their bid for a first white-ball title since 2011 - an achievement which looked unstoppable as they made rampant progress through the semi-final and group stage - fell at the final hurdle. Pat delivers again to join Australia's all-time greats Australia win 'one of the great World Cup victories' Reaction to Australia's victory against India 'Outstanding' Head's 137 guides Australia to World Cup win This was supposed to be India's day in front of an enormous home crowd with their prime minister Narendra Modi, who this stadium is named after, up in the stands. Instead, it ended in crushing disappointment as Head produced one of the great World Cup knocks and Australia ran out surprise and comfortable winners. By the time 29-year-old Head reached his century, some in the vast stands had already made their exit, while seamer Mohammed Siraj was in tears at the end. Australia were contenders when this tournament began, without being tipped by many to go all of the way, just like when they won the 2021 T20 World Cup. Their campaign hit serious jitters early on with defeats in their opening two games, first by India and then South Africa, but they have won the title with nine consecutive victories, beating every team in the tournament in a row. At the end, their players, including England's old foes David Warner and Steve Smith, charged onto the field in celebration. Australia may have won it all before, but this ranks as one of their greatest nights. Kohli takes a good catch to dismiss Warner for seven Head did not play in the first four games of Australia's campaign because of a broken hand, but Australia kept him in their squad, knowing the match-winning quality he possesses. He scored 109 in his first appearance against New Zealand but this innings was on another level as he first dealt with intense pressure before punishing the bowling. After his opening partner Warner nicked the first ball of the chase through the slips, Head crashed two boundaries to settle Australian nerves. Warner then edged a wide ball to slip for seven off Mohammed Shami, while Mitchell Marsh and Steve Smith both fell to the brilliant Jasprit Bumrah. The crowd was alive again at that stage, although Smith's lbw decision would have been overturned had he reviewed. Those wickets came in a manic opening period in which India took the upper hand but also gave up 15 extras in the powerplay alone, those in blue seemingly too eager to defend their low score. Batting became easier on a slow pitch that had offered more turn in the day, and Head took advantage. He cracked 14 fours and four sixes, with the sixes all pumped high over mid-wicket. On 99 he would have been run out as he scampered to three figures, had Ravindra Jadeja's throw hit from cover. He was finally out for 137, caught at deep mid-wicket attempting to finish in style. As he left the field he was embraced by Labuschagne and was congratulated by the Indians with the result already decided. 'Stunned into silence' Kohli goes for 54 to Cummins Head's innings will take the headlines, but this victory was built on a sensational performance with the ball and a brave decision to bowl first at the toss by Pat Cummins. Captain Rohit Sharma gave India a rapid start with 47 from 31 balls, but from 76-1 in the 10th over, Australia applied a stranglehold on India's star-studded batting line-up and did not let go. Head played a crucial hand too, brilliantly catching Rohit as he ran back from cover, before Shreyas Iyer was caught behind off Cummins four balls later to leave the hosts 81-3. That left Virat Kohli and KL Rahul to attempt a rebuild, but the canny Australia bowlers kept the scoring to a crawl through a mix of short, slower balls and athletic fielding, all while captain Cummins mixed his pack to great effect. Kohli and Rahul put on 67 in 109 balls before the former captain played on to Cummins for 54 in the 29th over to leave the vast stadium stunned in silence. Rahul then nicked a beauty from Starc, ending any real hope of a significant India score. India's lower order had hardly been needed in this tournament, and when finally called upon, Ravindra Jadeja managed only nine and Suryakumar Yadav 18 with just four boundaries coming after the first 10 overs. India's worst performance with the bat came at the worst possible time in the tournament, but huge credit must go to Cummins and his champion attack. Australia captain Pat Cummins: ""We saved our best for last and a couple of big-match players stood up and we're pretty chuffed. ""We were desperate in the field, I thought it all started against South Africa last week. The boys were fantastic. We've got an ageing squad but we are still throwing ourselves around. We were really chuffed with 240 because we were happy with anything under 300."" India captain Rohit Sharma: ""We were not good enough today but I'm really proud of the team and how we played from game one. We tried everything we could from our side but it wasn't supposed to be. ""We were looking at 270 or 280 but then we kept losing wickets. We couldn't get a partnership together and that is exactly what Australia did to win the game, they stitched a good partnership after they lost three wickets."" Player of the match, Australia's Travis Head: ""Not in a million years did I think that would happen [being man of the match today and in the World Test Championship final]. What an amazing day. I'm just thrilled to be a part of it. ""It is a lot better than being sat on the couch at home! I'm very lucky that everything went well and I was able to get back and the support that the boys showed, I didn't think this would happen. I was nervous in the first 20 balls but Marnus [Labuschagne] batted brilliantly and it is great to bat with him. It was an amazing partnership."" Former England bowler Steven Finn on BBC Test Match Special: ""Everything, from start to finish, that Australia did was outstanding. ""They were truly outstanding in the field again.

Under this, states can buy rice for Rs 2,800 per quintal (excluding the cost of transportation). This will come as a relief especially for Congress-ruled Karnataka, which has been at loggerheads with the Centre over rice procurement for its Anna Bhagya scheme. Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh hit out at the Centre for the reversal now, saying the “irrational policy (of stopping states from procuring rice) was undertaken with the sole intention of disrupting the Karnataka government’s Anna Bhagya Scheme”. A poll promise by the Congress, which dislodged the BJP from power in Karnataka, the scheme doubled the quota of rice available to each individual entitled to grains under the National Food Security Act, from 5 kg to 10 kg per month. Ramesh said that “the vendetta-driven decision had not only deprived the people of Karnataka of an additional five kilograms of rice through the Anna Bhagya Guarantee, but also increased India’s food subsidy bill by tens of thousands of crores”. Why Karnataka wanted the rice JUST DAYS ahead of the rollout of the Anna Bhagya Scheme by the newly elected Congress government in Karnataka, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Food Distribution announced in June last year that state governments could no longer acquire rice via the open market scheme of the FCI. The Centre justified the move as anti-inflationary, “to maintain sufficient stocks for market intervention / control (of) prices of wheat and rice”. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, however, said the decision was meant to specifically stymie his government, which was banking on FCI supply to meet its Anna Bhagya promise. The scheme had been one of the Congress’s “five guarantees” to voters in its manifesto, which are believed to have gone a long way in helping the party win the 2023 elections, and the party claimed that the BJP was trying to get back at it. As per Karnataka’s estimates, it needed 2.28 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of rice to facilitate 5 kg of free rice per member per BPL family over the next one year, apart from what was given under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The Karnataka scheme had identified 1.19 crore BPL card holding families for Anna Bhagya. The Central scheme recognises 96.19 lakh regular BPL card holder families, plus 10.36 lakh state BPL card holders as NFSA beneficiaries – making a total of 1.06 crore family beneficiaries. The Siddaramaiah government had therefore budgeted for Rs 890 crore per month as its expenditure for the scheme, hoping to source rice from the FCI at Rs 34 per kg (including Rs 2.60 per kg for transportation). After the Centre stopped this, the Siddaramaiah government had to resort to handing out cash amounting to Rs 170 per person to make up for the rice shortfall. These funds were deposited into the bank accounts of BPL family heads. Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates|True|False

411|"""Today in Politics: Karnataka BJP starts peaceful rally supporting 'honest' Siddaramaiah government; AAP-LG resolves another harmonious event"""|Today in Politics: Karnataka BJP begins march against ‘corrupt’ Siddaramaiah govt; AAP-LG reach yet another flashpoint  The BJP is going all out in its bid to corner the Siddaramaiah government in Karnataka. On Friday, BJP Karnataka president BY Vijayendra said the party was starting a seven-day padayatra (foot march) from Bengaluru to Mysuru on Saturday to take the fight against the Congress government to its “logical end”. The BJP has organised the march to raise further heat on Siddaramiah over the alleged Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) scam. The BJP has alleged that the CM’s wife Parvati was “illegally” benefitting from MUDA after the agency encroached on a parcel of land owned by her to create layouts. The BJP has also claimed that there was an irregularity in the purchase of land by her brother and also in the compensatory sites allotted by MUDA in exchange for the land. On July 26, Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot sent a show cause notice to Siddaramaiah on the scam. The Karnataka Council of Ministers on Thursday discussed the show cause notice. They alleged that it was a “gross misuse of the Constitutional Office’ of the Governor and said that a concerted effort was “being made to destabilise a lawfully elected majority government in Karnataka for political considerations”. While the BJP will use the march to hit out at the Congress government, there is a particular absence from the march that is causing the BJP discontent. Its ally in Karnataka, the Janata Dal (Secular), has publicly pulled out of the march. On Wednesday, JD(S) leader and Union minister HD Kumaraswamy declared that the party would not be part of the march, saying that many JD(S) leaders were not in favour of it at a time when people were battling rain-related issues. He also went on to accuse the BJP of “sidelining” the JD(S). Speaking to reporters in Delhi, the Union minister said: “In the region between Bengaluru and Mysuru, we (the JD-S) are strong. In this situation, if they do not take us into confidence in a proper manner, why should we support (the march)? The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Lieutenant Governor’s office in Delhi have reached yet another flashpoint. This time, the sparring occurred over the deaths of a woman and her child in East Delhi who had fallen into a drain after a downpour on Wednesday evening. On Friday, AAP leaders alleged that the drain was under the purview of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and demanded the resignation of the LG, who is the chairman of the Authority. The AAP has also announced a protest at the LG office on Saturday. The LG’s office shot back a letter in which it hit out at AAP leaders and said the drain was under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), which is under the Delhi government. “While this is undoubtedly another example of abuse typical of the AAP and its leadership, the fact of the matter is that the drain in which the unfortunate incident of drowning happened at Khoda colony belonged to the MCD under the control of AAP,” said the LG office. The 100-metre drain was neither desilted nor covered, it claimed. “AAP MP Sanjay Singh, MLA Kuldeep Kumar, party spokesperson Priyankar Kakkar and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), yesterday issued a patently false, deliberately misleading and blatantly improper statement holding the DDA responsible for the tragic death of a lady and her child by drowning and demanded the Hon’ble LG’s resignation. The same set of lies were again peddled today in a press conference by minister Gopal Rai and MLA Kuldeep Kumar,” the letter said. In a scathing attack on the AAP government, the LG office charged that the 10 years of “deliberate inaction, lack of development and worsening of civic infrastructure services” in Delhi “glossed over by rhetoric and hype generated through advertisements” was now getting “exposed”. The two-day Governors conference will continue on Saturday. On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Draupadi Murmu, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar and Union Home Minister Amit Shah addressed the programme. “In his address, the Prime Minister urged the Governors to play the role of an effective bridge between the Centre and the state and interact with people and social organisations in a manner to co-opt those who are underprivileged,” a press release issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan said. The conference, which ends on Saturday, “will cover a wide range of issues that play a critical role in not only shaping the Centre-state relations but also promoting welfare schemes for common people,” the release said. In her opening remarks, Murmu said it was crucial for the smooth functioning of democracy that various central agencies work with better coordination across all the states. She advised Governors to think about how they, as constitutional heads of their respective states, can promote this coordination. The PM will inaugurate the 32nd International Conference of Agricultural Economists (ICAE) in New Delhi on Saturday. This programme is being held in India after 65 years, an official statement said. The theme of the six-day triennial conference, organised by the International Association of Agricultural Economists, is Transformation Towards Sustainable Agri-Food Systems. The conference will witness participation of around 1,000 delegates from around 75 countries. — With PTI inputs Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates|True|False
414|Dalit leader who fought for SC sub-classification: ‘Verdict will benefit a hundred generations of Madigas, other downtrodden castes’|Dalit leader who fought for SC sub-classification: ‘Verdict will benefit a hundred generations of Madigas, other downtrodden castes’  The Supreme Court in a landmark verdict on Thursday allowed the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in reservation, allowing wider protection for underrepresented groups. Following the order, Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said the state would immediately start the process of sub-classification to implement the reservation for the Madiga community and other Dalit sub-castes. Madigas are the largest of the 59 SC sub-castes in Telangana followed by the Malas. According to unofficial estimates of the previous Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) government, SCs make up around 19% of the state’s population. Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi (MRPS) chief Manda Krishna Madiga who has been a vocal supporter of the sub-classification for decades said the top court’s order was a massive victory for the marginalised communities among SCs and STs. During the Telangana Assembly polls last year, amid a BJP outreach to Dalits, Madiga shared the stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a rally, where he was photographed in tears and being consoled by the PM. In an interview with The Indian Express, Manda Krishna Madiga talks about the long-drawn fight for sub-classification, the political support for it, and the impact of the Supreme Court verdict. Excerpts: * How do you feel after winning the battle for sub-caste reservation? The decades-long agitation of Madiga people has come to a conclusion as we got what we desired. The movement, which started in 1994, has come to a conclusion after 30 long years. The judgment has brought us much happiness. * How has this journey been for you? The agitation saw many ups and downs, and efforts were made to derail it several times. We suffered a lot during the process. But we got the support of people from across the spectrum. We are happy about that. * Who will this judgment benefit? A hundred generations to come ahead will benefit from this. Our sacrifices have not been in vain. A hundred generations of Madigas and other downtrodden castes will benefit from this judgment. * What contributed to this victory? I attribute this victory to three kinds of people. One, those who gave up their lives for reservation. Secondly, MRPS workers who overcame all odds to stand by the party. Next, I also thank the support given by people of different castes to this agitation. * There are several people who died by suicide in public for the MRPS’s cause. What is your plan for their family members? We will form committees to support the families. We will give them all that they need after bringing the matter up for discussion in the MRPS governing body. * Have you received support from any political parties in the past? We have got support from several parties, including the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Congress, and the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS). * Did the BJP support you? Yes, we did get support from the BJP too before the elections. * Which party are you aligned with now? We stand independent at this juncture. We have taken help from all parties who supported the sub-categorisation agitation. But we are an independent party that struggled and agitated on our own.

Justin Simien is getting real about last year's Lando debacle. Three years after first being announced but with nothing to show for it, concerning news broke that the Simien-helmed, Donald Glover-starring Solo: A Star Wars Story spinoff series would instead be a movie. Since then, again, nothing. The radio silence resumed until Friday, when Collider published remarks from Simien indicating that Lando will not be moving forward. JONATHAN OLLEY /LUCASFILM LTD. Simien is on the road promoting Hollywood Black, an MGM+ docuseries based on the trailblazing book by scholar Donald Bogle examining race and representation in Hollywood. In an interview with Collider's Christina Radish, Simien vented his feelings over the saga of the stalled series. ""It was pretty developed,"" he shared. ""There was a Bible, there was concept art, there were scripts, but it just wasn’t meant to be."" Ever since the Star Wars cinematic universe expanded to the small screen, there have been so many shelved, canceled, and abandoned projects that critics write listicles and fans fill up Reddit threads discussing which they would have most enjoyed seeing. Simien is a part of a vast network of crestfallen creators, but the camaraderie hasn't soothed the sting. ""For me, it has to be done pretty straight on. Like, ‘I am in grief. I do not feel good.’ I have to let myself feel those feelings,"" he said. ""There’s so much that I experience that I get to keep forever and take into the next project. I can’t obviously take the storyline or the IP or the characters, but there’s so much more that I got, as a maker, and that’s mine. Sorry, it’s too late, you can’t take that part back."" Lando was first announced back in 2020 during a Disney investors' call. In a Star Wars era increasingly defined by backstory spinoffs, the move made perfect sense. Glover's Lando was the breakout star of Solo, and Simien was a rising star with three seasons of Dear White People, the series he created, directed, and wrote for Netflix, under his belt. Fans grew even more excited about the series when it was announced that Glover and his brother Stephen, the showrunner on Atlanta and a producer of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, would step in as co-writers. Exactly why Lando fell through the cracks at Disney+ is still unclear. Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. Simien remains undeterred, however, bringing Hollywood Black to MGM+ and looking forward a live-action Star Trek comedy series starring Tawny Newsome. The news was announced at the most recent San Diego Comic-Con, coming with the tagline, ""Federation outsiders serving a gleaming resort planet find out their day-to-day exploits are being broadcast to the entire quadrant."" ""I literally grew up watching that show and wishing I could go to space,"" told Collider about the Star Trek project. I’m living that childhood dream right now.""

439|IDF targets Beirut suburb in retaliation for attack that killed 12 in the Golan Heights|"Israel says it killed Hezbollah leader in Beirut strike after attack on Golan Heights          Israel’s military says it has killed a Hezbollah official who it blamed for a deadly attack last week on the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 young people. The Israel Defense Forces said it killed Fuad Shukr on Tuesday in an airstrike in the area of Beirut in Lebanon. The IDF said that Shukr “was the commander responsible for the murder of the 12 children in Majdal Shams in northern Israel on Saturday evening, as well as the killing of numerous Israelis and foreign nationals over the years.” Israel was targeting Shukr, better known by his nickname, Hajj Mohsen, in the strike in a suburb of southern Beirut, an Israeli official told NBC News. Mohsen is a senior adviser to Hezbollah’s supreme leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a member of the group’s military council, according to a U.S. government profile. Shukr “has the blood of many Israelis on his hands. Tonight, we have shown that the blood of our people has a price, and that there is no place out of reach for our forces to this end,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the rocket attack Saturday, which struck a soccer field in the Golan Heights. Militants in Lebanon and Israel have been trading fire since Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel and the start of the war in Gaza, raising fears that the fighting will spiral into a regional conflict. Al Manar, a satellite television station run by Hezbollah, reported that Israel had ""launched an aerial aggression that targeted the southern suburb of Beirut."" ""Local sources reported that the raid in the Haret Hreik area was carried out by a drone and 3 missiles were fired,"" the report added. The television station also said a building Israel targeted in the Haret Hreik area, a Hezbollah stronghold, had collapsed. Al Manar reported that two people were killed and at least 10 were wounded in the strike. Personnel from the emergency room at Bahman Hospital in Beirut told NBC News that a woman was killed and 17 other people were wounded, including six children and two who were in critical condition. In a statement, the Lebanese Red Cross said more than one person had been killed and over 20 had been injured. The Lebanese Health Ministry said a woman was killed and up to 68 other people were injured, five of them critically. Photographs from the area also showed cars crushed and covered with rubble. Saturday's strike on Majdal Shams killed at least 12 people, most of them children and teenagers belonging to the minority Druze community. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack. In a series of statements Saturday, it did say it had struck nearby military targets in the Golan Heights. In one statement, it claimed to have used a Falaq-1 rocket, the same munition Israel says hit the soccer field. However, the timings in the Hezbollah statements do not neatly align with the strike. Hezbollah said the Falaq-1 rocket was fired at 5:20 p.m., while the IDF says Majdal Shams was hit at 6:18 p.m. The Israeli military said the attack on Majdal Shams, which is on the border with Lebanon, was the deadliest strike on civilians in Israeli territory since Oct. 7. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed back to Tel Aviv from the U.S. as outrage built in Israel. “Israel is approaching the moment of an all-out war against Hezbollah,” the Israeli military said at the time. “The IDF is prepared and ready to protect Israel’s security.” In January, an Israeli airstrike on Beirut killed Saleh Arouri, a top Hamas official. It was the first time Israel had hit Beirut since the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Asked for comment Tuesday's strike, a White House National Security Council spokesperson told NBC News that the agency defers to Israel ""to speak to its own military operations"" but supports its right to defend itself. ""Our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad and unwavering against all Iran-backed threats, including Hezbollah, and we are working on a diplomatic solution that will allow citizens to safely return to their homes,"" the spokesperson said. Israel’s military said that Shukr joined Hezbollah in 1985 and that he was the head of Hezbollah’s Strategic Unit and had responsibility for weaponry that included missiles, rockets and drones.

Sexual offenders in Tamil cinema may be banned, actors' union proposes strict measures after Malayalam cinema scandal PM Modi, his Singapore counterpart Lawrence Wong visit semiconductor facility in Singapore, hold talks with officials   BOLLYWOOD Kriti Sanon's fans have rallied behind her over the recent viral video that appeared to show her smoking Abhimanyu Mathur Updated : Aug 01, 2024, 10:39 PM IST Kriti Sanon is currently in Greece vacationing with friends and family. The actress rang in her 34th birthday in the Mediterranean nation last week. But things soured after a video of hers purportedly smoking there went viral. Many trolls attacked the actress calling her a hypocrite given that she had vehemently stated she is anti-smoking in earlier interviews. Now, a section of the internet has come out in Kriti’s defence, slamming trolls for invading her privacy and filming a private moment. The video appears to show Kriti sitting by the oceanside smoking a cigarette. The video has been shot from far and does not show with clarity what the actress is holding. However, fans said that it need not be a concern even if she is smoking. Reacting to the video, one Twitter user said, “Let her live her life and enjoy her vacation. What is the fuss here I don't know.” A comment on Reddit added that what she does in her private life should not be criticised. “Ehh who cares? As long as she's not promoting it, she can do whatever she wants in her private life,” read the comment.  Many actually slammed the person who shot and posted the video online, arguing that it constitutes an invasion of privacy as the actress was in her private space at the time. One fan asked, “Is it okay to click pics without permission??? She isn't in some media promotion event, it's her private life.” Many supported this argument. One comment read, “Just because they're famous, doesn't mean you're not going to respect their personal space or invade their privacy. They don't owe us that.” Kriti Sanon was last seen on screen in the comedy heist film Crew. Not only was the film a box office success but the actress also  impressed everyone with her performance in. Kriti will be next seen in the movie Do Patti, which is also produced by her. The film marks her second collaboration with Kajol after Dilwale and is currently under production. The DNA app is now available for download on the Google Play Store.

Rowling, Elon Musk Criticize Olympics After Algeria’s Imane Khelif Wins Women’s Boxing Match Amid Gender Controversy: ‘A Misogynist Sporting Establishment’   By Zack Sharf  J.K. Rowling and Elon Musk are among the high-profile names condemning the Olympics for allowing Algeria’s Imane Khelif to compete in the women’s boxing competition at the Paris 2024 games. Khelif was disqualified from last year’s Women’s World Championships after she failed a gender eligibility test due to elevated levels of testosterone in her system. At the Paris Olympics, Khelif’s boxing match against Italy’s Angela Carini ended in 46 seconds after Carini decided to bow out of the fight after taking some punches from Khelif. Carini fought back tears as she ended the match and later told the BBC: “It could have been the match of a lifetime, but I had to preserve my life as well in that moment.”  “Could any picture sum up our new men’s rights movement better?” Rowling wrote on X while sharing a picture of Carini in tears and Khelif trying to comfort her after the match was cut short. “The smirk of a male who’s knows he’s protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he’s just punched in the head, and whose life’s ambition he’s just shattered.”  Musk shared a post from swimmer Riley Gaines that claimed “men don’t belong in women’s sports.” The X owner co-signed the message by writing: “Absolutely.” The Olympics has stood by its decision to allow Khelif, who was born female, to compete in the women’s boxing competition, saying: “Everyone competing in the women’s category is complying with the competition eligibility rules. They are women in their passports and it is stated that is the case, that they are female.” Carini told press that she would not criticize Khelif’s placement in the women’s competition, saying: “I wish her to carry on until the end and that she can be happy. I am someone who doesn’t judge anyone. I am not here to give judgements.” Khelif’s next boxing match at the Paris Olympics will be against Hungary’s Anna Luca Hamori.

Trump is urging the judge who oversaw his Manhattan criminal trial to step aside, claiming in a legal filing that the judge has indirect ties to Vice President Kamala Harris and therefore an “actual conflict and appearances of impropriety.” In a letter to the judge released on Thursday — two months after Mr. Trump was convicted of falsifying documents to hide a sex scandal — Mr. Trump’s lawyers said that the judge’s daughter “has a longstanding relationship with Harris,” who is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and Mr. Trump’s election opponent. Mr. Trump’s legal team cited the daughter’s “work for political campaigns” as a Democratic consultant, an argument that many ethics experts had previously rejected. The letter is the former president’s latest long-shot bid to oust the judge, Juan M. Merchan, from the case. The judge, a former Republican now known as a moderate Democrat, refused Mr. Trump’s request last year to step aside. He cited a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter’s interests. Before the trial, Mr. Trump also tried unsuccessfully to remove the judge, who declared on the first day of jury selection in April, “There is no agenda here” and “We want justice to be done.” ADVERTISEMENT The new effort comes at a crucial moment, after Mr. Trump’s conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and before his sentencing next month. Mr. Trump has asked Justice Merchan to throw out the verdict in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling granting him broad immunity for official actions he took while in the White House. The Manhattan district attorney’s office, which brought the case, has argued that the Supreme Court decision had “no bearing on this prosecution” and urged the judge to uphold the jury’s verdict. Justice Merchan has promised to rule on Sept. 6. If he rejects Mr. Trump’s bid to toss out the conviction, he is set to impose the former president’s sentence on Sept. 18. Mr. Trump faces up to four years in prison, though the judge could decide on a much shorter jail term, or sentence him only to probation. Mr. Trump has sparred with the judge for months. In the lead-up to the trial, Mr. Trump berated Justice Merchan and his daughter, Loren Merchan, citing her work for Democratic candidates. But at the request of the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan imposed a gag order preventing Mr. Trump from assailing family members of prosecutors and the judge — in addition to prohibiting criticism of witnesses and jurors. Mr. Trump violated the order 10 times during the trial, resulting in $10,000 in fines. ADVERTISEMENT After the trial, Justice Merchan allowed attacks on witnesses and jurors, though he extended until Mr. Trump’s sentencing a narrow version of the gag order that covers prosecutors and their family members as well as family members of the judge. On Thursday, a New York appeals court rejected Mr. Trump’s effort to unwind those restrictions. The presidential election is 61 days away. Here’s our guide to the run-up to Election Day.

Since Ms. Harris took over the top of the Democratic ticket last month when President Biden stepped aside, she has emphasized her prosecutorial record and hammered Mr. Trump as a criminal. He is the first former American president to become a felon. Mr. Trump has falsely portrayed his conviction as the product of machinations by President Biden and Ms. Harris. He has also sought to parry Ms. Harris’s attacks on him over the conviction by calling the judge biased, underscoring the importance to him of removing the gag order. “The court’s unjust and unconstitutional gag order continues to restrict President Trump’s ability to respond to Harris and address these topics with the American people,” his lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, wrote in the letter to the judge that was made public on Thursday. “Decisions by Your Honor on the pending Presidential immunity motion and at any sentencing would benefit not only Harris but also the professional aspirations and financial status of Your Honor’s daughter.” It is unclear how closely tied Ms. Merchan was to Ms. Harris. Cached pages from the website of Authentic Campaigns, a Democratic fund-raising and marketing firm, listed Loren Merchan in January 2024 as president. Her biography on the website noted that she had managed media campaigns for Ms. Harris, Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Beto O’Rourke. Mike Nellis, the chief executive of Authentic, declined to comment. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Trump was convicted in late May when a jury of 12 New Yorkers found he had falsified records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, in the final days of the 2016 campaign. Mr. Trump’s then-fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual liaison with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump repaid Mr. Cohen soon after ascending to the presidency, and approved plans to lie on company paperwork to hide the nature of the reimbursement, the jury found. In a recent filing, Mr. Bragg’s office cited “the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty.” William K. Rashbaum and Jonah E. Bromwich contributed reporting. Ben Protess is an investigative reporter at The Times, writing about public corruption.

The stock’s rise was accompanied by massive trading volume. More than 76 million shares of the Truth Social app owner changed hands Monday, ten times the stock’s 30-day average. Trump, who was formally nominated as the Republican Party’s presidential candidate Monday, said he was grazed by a bullet and treated at a local hospital in Pennsylvania on Saturday but was released late Saturday after the shooting. Shares in Trump Media were 50% higher in premarket trading at 6:29 a.m. ET, off earlier highs. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes offered his “deepest sympathies” to those who were wounded in the attack in Pennsylvania and to the family of the person killed at the event. “The situation demands a fast, thorough federal investigation to determine all the circumstances of this cowardly attack and to identify if any additional persons were involved,” Nunes said in a Saturday statement. “I also call for the federal government to provide any security resources requested by President Trump to guarantee his safety,” he added. Analysts suggested the assassination attempt could make a Trump victory in the November election more likely. “The events on Saturday, if they do anything, they strengthen the case for President Donald Trump to win the election in November. I think that’s what the markets have reacted to this evening,” Rob Casey, partner at Signum Global Advisors told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Monday. Trump Media, the parent company of social media platform Truth Social, has seen volatile trading throughout the election race. The stock plummeted nearly 50% in the three weeks following the felony conviction of Trump, who is also the firm’s majority shareholder. It comes as Truth Social struggles to grow its small user base. In its first-quarter earnings report, filed in May, Trump Media posted a net loss of $327.6 million and total revenue of $770,500. The company warned investors last month that if Trump uses other social media platforms beyond Truth Social, it “could have a material adverse effect on the business and/or operations of TMTG.” Got a confidential news tip?

Ensemble and its allies are projected to secure between 150 and 180 seats, according to an IFOP estimate, behind the leading New Popular Front’s 180-215 result. Both factions have outpaced the winner of the first parliamentary vote, the far-right Rassemblement National — RN or National Rally. France now looks likely to be stranded in a hung-parliament scenario that divides it between three strongly represented parties that must broker alliances to gain absolute control. Attal, who stepped in as France’s youngest ever prime minister only in January, is unlikely to hold the country’s second-highest position as part of the upcoming administration. “Faithful to the Republican tradition and in accordance with my principles, tomorrow morning I will submit my resignation to the president of the Republic,” Attal said Sunday, according to a CNBC translation. “I know that, in light of the results of this evening, many French people feel a certain uncertainty about the future, as no absolute majority has emerged [in parliament]. Our country is experiencing an unprecedented political situation,” Attal added His departure was widely expected in the wake of the first presidential vote, when analysts had circulated the possibility that Macron would have to concede the prime minister’s office to RN leader Jordan Bardella, if the far right retained its advance. “From the beginning of this campaign, I was alerted to three risks: the risk of an absolute majority dominated by the France Unbowed, the risk of an absolute majority dominated by Rassemblement National, and the risk of the disappearance of a movement that embodies our ideas and our values,” Attal said Sunday night. “These three risks, today, were discarded by the French people. Tonight, no absolute majority can be led by the extremes.” In light of the run-off results, Attal set the scene for a period of transition for France’s political landscape: “Ladies and gentlemen, this evening, a new era begins. A new era for our nation,” he said. Faced with uncertainty in one of Europe’s forefront economies, markets will be following the next few days for indications of what alliances will forge to achieve ruling majority. France’s leadership is unlikely to be entirely dismantled in the wake of the elections, as Macron has previously indicated he would serve out the remainder of his term until 2027, irrespective of the outcome of the vote.

And the producer is in no mood to sit silent about the buzz. He has released a statement debunking the rumours. Also read: Varun Dhawan was upset about sharing the screen with Sidharth Malhotra in Student of The Year, says David Dhawan Earlier, there was buzz that Sreeleela has been roped in for the film, which was said to be Sreeleela’s debut vehicle in Bollywood. According to the recent rumours, Sreeleela walked out of the comedy film, which is being directed by David Dhawan and produced by Tips Films. It was also stated that the first schedule of the film has been completed without her. However, Ramesh has said that it is not true as they have not approached anyone for the role. Producer Ramesh Taurani from Tips Films has come forward to clarify all the rumours of the actor walking out of their upcoming comedy entertainer. “We have not yet approached anyone for the role. We are still in the process of finalising the cast. The first schedule has just been completed,” Ramesh said. He added that they will soon announce an update about the project. “We will make an official announcement once we have locked someone for that role. Until then, we request audiences not to believe any rumours,” the producer stressed.

Several reports state that the filming began on July 12 at Mehboob Studios in Mumbai, following which the production is expected to shift to other locations. When it comes to the professional sphere, Sreeleela was last seen in Guntur Kaaram with Mahesh Babu. She is also known for featuring in films such as Kiss, Bharaate and Dhamaka.

Pezeshkian has promised to reach out to the West and ease enforcement on the country’s mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic. (AP video by Mohsen Ganji )                     DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian won Iran’s runoff presidential election Saturday, besting hard-liner Saeed Jalili by promising to reach out to the West and ease enforcement on the country’s mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic. Pezeshkian promised no radical changes to Iran’s Shiite theocracy in his campaign and long has held Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the final arbiter of all matters of state in the country. But even Pezeshkian’s modest aims will be challenged by an Iranian government still largely held by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, and Western fears over Tehran enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels with enough of a stockpile to produce several nuclear weapons if it chose. A vote count offered by authorities put Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jalili’s 13.5 million in Friday’s election. Overall, Iran’s Interior Ministry said 30 million people voted in an election held without internationally recognized monitors, representing a turnout of 49.6% — higher than the historic low of the June 28 first round vote but lower than other presidential races. Supporters of Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and longtime lawmaker, entered the streets of Tehran and other cities before dawn to celebrate as his lead grew over Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator. Pezeshkian later traveled to the mausoleum of the late Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and addressed journalists in a chaotic event. “In this election, I didn’t give you false promises. I did not lie,” Pezeshkian said. “It’s been many years after the revolution that we come to the podium, we make promises and we fail to fulfill them. This is the biggest problem we have.” Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 Pezeshkian’s win still sees Iran at a delicate moment, with tensions high in the Mideast and a looming election in the United States that could put any chance of a detente between Tehran and Washington at risk. Pezeshkian’s victory also wasn’t a rout of Jalili, meaning he’ll have to carefully navigate Iran’s internal politics as the doctor has never held a sensitive, high-level security post.  Government officials up to Khameni, the supreme leader, predicted higher turnout as voting got underway, with state television airing images of modest lines at some polling centers. However, online videos purported to show some polls empty while a survey of several dozen sites in Tehran saw light traffic and a heavy security presence on the streets. Authorities counted 607,575 voided votes — which often are a sign of protest by those who feel obligated to cast a ballot but reject both candidates. Khamenei praised the turnout Saturday despite what he alleged was a boycott campaign “orchestrated by the enemies of the Iranian nation to induce despair and a feeling of hopelessness.” “I would like to recommend Dr. Pezeshkian, the elected president, put his trust in God, the Compassionate, and set his vision on high, bright horizons,” Khamenei added. Voters expressed a guarded optimism. A woman casts her vote for the presidential election in a polling station at the shrine of Saint Saleh in northern Tehran, Iran, Friday, July 5, 2024.

(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi) The election came amid heightened regional tensions. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups armed by Tehran — such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels — are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks. While Khamenei remains the final decision-maker on matters of state, Pezeshkian could bend the country’s foreign policy toward either confrontation or collaboration with the West. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, which has reached a detente with Iran, sent his congratulations to Pezeshkian that stressed his “keenness to develop and deepen the relations that bring our two countries and peoples together.” Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has relied on Iranian-made drones in his war on Ukraine, similarly congratulated Pezeshkian. Responding to questions from The Associated Press, the U.S. State Department called the Iranian election “not free or fair” and noted that “a significant number of Iranians chose not to participate at all.” Candidate for the Iran’s presidential election Saeed Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator, casts his vote for the presidential runoff election at a polling station in Qarchak near Tehran, Iran, Friday, July 5, 2024. (AP Photo) “We have no expectation these elections will lead to fundamental change in Iran’s direction or more respect for the human rights of its citizens,” the State Department added. “As the candidates themselves have said, Iranian policy is set by the supreme leader.” However, it said it would pursue diplomacy “when it advances American interests.” Candidates repeatedly touched on what would happen if former President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, won the November election. Iran has held indirect talks with President Joe Biden’s administration, though there’s been no clear movement back toward constraining Tehran’s nuclear program for the lifting of economic sanctions. Pezeshkian’s win saw Iran’s rial strengthen Saturday against the U.S. dollar, trading 603,000 to $1, down from 615,000 on Thursday. The rial traded 32,000 to $1 at the time the 2015 nuclear deal was reached. Though identifying with reformists and relative moderates within Iran’s theocracy during the campaign, Pezeshkian at the same time honored Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, on one occasion wearing its uniform to parliament. He repeatedly criticized the United States and praised the Guard for shooting down an American drone in 2019, saying it “delivered a strong punch in the mouth of the Americans and proved to them that our country will not surrender.” The late President Ebrahim Raisi, whose death in a May helicopter crash sparked the early election, was seen as a protégé of Khamenei and a potential successor as supreme leader. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.

636|"""Discovery in Ladakh debunks alien life search, harsh climate with high UV radiation, extreme temperature fluctuations, and abundant water availability makes it a poor Martian analogue."""|"Discovery in Ladakh could forever change search for alien life  Listen to Story Scientists have made a new discovery in Ladakh that could revolutionise the search for extraterrestrial life. Researchers from the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) have identified magnetofossils - fossil remains of magnetic particles produced by magnetotactic bacteria - in rock varnish layers in the region known as India's ""cold desert."" This finding, published in Planetary and Space Science, suggests that biotic processes play a crucial role in the formation of rock varnish, demonstrating how life can thrive in extreme environments.  Rock varnish, a dark-coloured natural coating rich in manganese, iron, and clay minerals, forms on rock surfaces and fractures in extremely dry and cold environments, and is believed to provide nutritional support to microbiota. Ladakh's harsh climate, characterised by high UV radiation, extreme temperature fluctuations, and limited water availability, makes it an ideal terrestrial analogue for Martian conditions. Dr. Amritpal Singh Chaddha and Dr. Anupam Sharma, lead researchers at BSIP, analyzed rock varnish samples from Ladakh using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Their analysis revealed nanochains of magnetofossils and higher concentrations of oxidized manganese and carboxylic acid, indicating organic signatures.    The similarity between Ladakh's rock varnish and that observed on Mars during Nasa's Perseverance rover operations inspired this research. The study's findings highlight the potential of rock varnish as an archive of ancient environmental records and a valuable resource for astrobiological studies. This discovery has significant implications for future space exploration. By identifying biotic signatures in rock varnish, scientists can better target potential biosignatures on Mars and other celestial bodies, enhancing the search for extraterrestrial life. The research provides crucial insights for planning future missions by space agencies like Isro, particularly in Mars exploration where identifying habitable environments is a primary objective. As we continue to explore the possibilities of life beyond Earth, studies like this from Ladakh serve as stepping stones, bridging our understanding of extreme terrestrial environments with the potential for life in the cosmos."|False|False

642|Not cast in stone: Naidu govt mulls over removing Jagan images from boundary markers, passbooks|Not cast in stone: Naidu govt mulls over removing Jagan images from boundary markers, passbooks  During the recently concluded Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, the state Land Titling Act became a flashpoint between the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), with the former claiming that the system before the Land Tilling Act came into effect led to land encroachment under the previous regime and the TDP accusing the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led party of using the Act to grab land and property without the proper documents. After the N Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP alliance came to power, the new state government fulfilled its poll promise and repealed the Land Titling Act on July 24. Now, the Naidu government is contemplating removing Jagan Mohan Reddy’s photographs from the land boundary marker stones that were fixed during land surveys and from lakhs of land ownership passbooks issued as part of the Act. Naidu told the Assembly this week that the government would reissue the pattadar passbooks with only the official state seal. “The Jagan government wasted Rs 15 crore for printing his photos on the passbooks. The state government, as promised during the electioneering and as per the demand of the people, has decided to issue passbooks with the official seal. Officers have already submitted a copy of the passbook carrying the official seal,” said the CM. However, the TDP government is at a loss over what to do with approximately 77 lakh boundary stones with Jagan’s photo carved on them that revenue officials had planted. After the TDP stormed back to power, many farmers and landowners ripped out the stones, mostly because they disputed the land markings. The TDP’s Revenue Minister Anagani Satya Prasad claimed over 80% of land and property owners were unhappy with the YSRCP surveys and had initiated litigation. “We will be holding ‘gram sabhas’ in over 7,000 villages to ascertain if the land had been marked properly or not, and in consultations with the villagers, will conduct a resurvey if necessary and mark the boundaries accordingly,” he added. TDP ministers also alleged the Jagan government spent over Rs 600 crore to procure the boundary stones and carve the former CM’s image on them. “Though the Centre has never mentioned the issue of laying stones in the directions for the survey, Jagan prepared granite stones only for carving his pictures,” Satya Prasad said. Officials said that the exercise to re-issue land title passbooks without Jagan’s photograph, and the removal of the boundary stones with Jagan’s carving might cost up to Rs 15 crore. “The lakhs of granite stones that will be removed will be used for other purposes,” an official said. YSRCP spokesperson and former minister Ambati Rambabu accused the TDP and Naidu of levelling false allegations. “The land survey was done very scientifically and involved technology that ensured very precise marking of lands. The TDP had originally supported the YSRCP’s land survey but made a U-turn and opposed it. Even now, they are backtracking from their opposition by saying that they will conduct a re-survey, which means it will be a continuation of what the YSRCP government started,” he said. In October 2020, after the NITI Aayog, the Centre’s policy think tank, recommended the implementation of the Land Titling Act in all states, Andhra Pradesh became one of the first states to conduct land surveys to implement it. As per the now-repealed Act, all land and immovable property must be compulsorily registered with government agencies that will then issue permanent titles for them. The Act also provided a new system for speedy property dispute resolution by establishing tribunals. After the Act was rolled out, several property owners raised objections to the method of surveying lands using drones and geotagging, which resulted in discrepancies and disputes. During the election campaign, Naidu and ally JanaSena Party chief K Pawan Kalyan alleged that the YSRCP wanted to usurp land under the Act. In his public meetings, Naidu said the process of land surveys was full of discrepancies and that the people involved were not technically qualified to conduct such surveys.

664|Mamata, movies, politics: How Bengal CM again displayed her hold over Tollywood|Mamata, movies, politics: How Bengal CM again displayed her hold over Tollywood  The Bengali film industry has been an enthusiastic supporter of Mamata Banerjee since her rise to power over a decade ago and recently the West Bengal Chief Minister displayed the hold she continues to have over Tollywood as the industry is popularly known. Banerjee recently intervened to resolve a stalemate between directors and technicians over the boycott of the shoots of director Rahool Mukherjee. On July 30, actors Prosenjit Chatterjee and Dev along with filmmaker Goutam Ghose met Banerjee in an attempt to resolve the deadlock as studios remained closed and several shooting projects remained on hold after technicians refused to work on a film Mukherjee is directing. The director is currently facing a three-month ban imposed by the Federation of Cine Technicians’ Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) for allegedly violating the industry’s norms by employing Bangladeshi technicians on a previous project. The stand-off escalated last Saturday when technicians walked off the set of Mukherjee’s new film, leading to a show of solidarity from other directors who ceased work on Monday in protest. The industry remained divided, with prominent figures such as Prosenjit and Anirban Bhattacharya supporting Mukherjee, while technicians stuck to their positions. However, soon after the meeting between the industry veterans and the CM, the standoff was resolved and shooting in Tollygunge’s studios resumed on Wednesday. Both Chatterjee and Dev, who is a Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP, expressed gratitude to Banerjee for her support and expressed confidence about a swift resolution of the issue. Time and again, Banerjee and her party have swayed the Bengali film industry by making legislators out of film stars while rewarding many film personalities with awards. Sources said Banerjee knows very well that being surrounded by celebrities fetches her party easy votes. “The trend of celebrities joining political parties and getting involved in active politics exists across the country. This is no different. Mamata Banerjee cares for film personalities and wants to further develop the industry. The state government has always given them priority. Therefore, she has nothing but the best interest of the film industry in mind,” said a TMC insider. Bengali film and television stars dominate the stage of most state-sponsored cultural events, because Banerjee promotes them, inviting them to attend her party meetings and rallies and using their star quotient for political purposes. Over the years, the TMC’s annual Martyrs’ Day rally in Kolkata on July 21 has become a star-studded affair, with Bengali film stars occupying front-row seats on stage. Ahead of this year’s Lok Sabha polls, Banerjee appeared in the popular Bengali TV show “Didi No 1” as part of her outreach campaign. Its host Rachana Banerjee is the current TMC MP from Hooghly. Not just Rachana or Dev, Mamata over the years has handpicked actors and actresses to win crucial seats in Lok Sabha and Assembly elections — from established actors such as Tapas Pal, Shatabdi Roy, Debashree Roy, Moon Moon Sen and Chiranjeet, to stars from the younger generation such as Dev, Mimi Chakraborty, Nusrat Jahan, and singer Aditi Munshi. The trend has continued in recent years with more celebrities such as director Raj Chakraborty, actors Soham Chakraborty, Sayantika Banerjee, Saayoni Ghosh, June Maliah, and Kanchan Mullick joining the party and winning elections; not to mention her roping in of heavyweights such as Shatrughan Sinha and Babul Supriyo from the BJP. Apart from political positions, The TMC government has also bestowed honours on industry names who are close to it. Since 2012, the Mamata government has been conferring the Mahanayak Samman and other awards to Bengali film and television personalities “for outstanding contributions in the world of cinema”. This year, the CM has conferred the Mahanayak Samman on Bengali Rachana Banerjee and singer Nachiketa Chakraborty. Prosenjit Chatterjee was given a special award for his contribution to the Bengali film industry over the last four decades. Actors Subhasis Mukherjee, Ambarish Bhattacharya, and Rukmini Moitra received special awards.

670|Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III assumed direct oversight of the case and effectively put the death penalty back on the table.|Defense Secretary Revokes Plea Deal for Accused Sept. 11 Plotters  ADVERTISEMENT  Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III assumed direct oversight of the case and effectively put the death penalty back on the table. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Carol Rosenberg Reporting from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III on Friday overruled the overseer of the war court at Guantánamo Bay and revoked a plea agreement reached earlier this week with the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and two alleged accomplices. The Pentagon announced the decision with a memorandum relieving the senior Defense Department official responsible for military commissions of her oversight of the capital case against Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and his alleged accomplices for the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York City, at the Pentagon and in a Pennsylvania field. The overseer, retired Brig. Gen. Susan K. Escallier, signed a pretrial agreement on Wednesday with Mr. Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi that exchanged guilty pleas for sentences of at most life in prison. In taking away the authority, Mr. Austin assumed direct oversight of the case and canceled the agreement, effectively reinstating it as a death-penalty case. He left Ms. Escallier in the role of oversight of Guantánamo’s other cases. ADVERTISEMENT Because of the stakes involved, the “responsibility for such a decision should rest with me,” Mr. Austin said in an order released Friday night by the Pentagon. “Effective immediately, in the exercise of my authority, I hereby withdraw from the three pretrial agreements that you signed on July 31, 2024.” The crime. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, and four other defendants are facing charges in a U.S. military tribunal at Guantánamo Bay of aiding the hijackings that killed nearly 3,000 people. The charges carry the death penalty. The trial. The defendants were arraigned in 2012, but the case has been mired in pretrial proceedings, much of them focused on the C.I.A.’s torture of the defendants. The role of torture. In 2021, a military judge in Guantanamo's other capital case threw out key evidence because that prisoner was tortured. Defense lawyers in the Sept. 11 case are challenging the same type of evidence, and seeking to have either the case or possibility of a death penalty dismissed because of torture. The plea deal. A Pentagon official authorized a plea agreement meant to resolve the case with lifetime sentences for Mohammed and two other defendants. But Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin abruptly canceled the deal, reviving the possibility that they could someday face a death penalty trial. Defense lawyers are now challenging Austin’s rescindment as unlawful, or simply too late. The defendants in the plea deal. Along with Mohammed, Walid bin Attash is accused of training two of the hijackers, researching flights and timetables and testing the ability of a passenger to hide a razor knife on flights. Mustafa al-Hawsawi is accused of helping some of the hijackers with finances and travel arrangements. The other defendants. Ammar al-Baluchi is accused of transferring money from the United Arab Emirates to some of the hijackers in the United States. He chose not to join the plea agreement and could face trial alone. Ramzi bin al-Shibh was accused of helping to organize a cell of hijackers in Germany. In 2023, he was found medically incompetent to stand trial and removed from the case. He could someday face trial if his mental health is restored. Mr. Austin’s decision brought relief to family members of victims who had expressed anger over the deal, but it also left uncertain the next steps of the prosecution over America’s deadliest terrorist attack. Before this week’s developments, jury selection in the 12- to 18-month trial was not envisioned to start before 2026, meaning a verdict was likely to be years away. The case had become mired in more than a decade of pretrial proceedings that focused on whether the detainees’ torture in secret C.I.A. prisons had contaminated the evidence against them. With the plea deal upended, the military judge, Col. Matthew N. McCall, is likely to resume hearing testimony next week. He had been working toward deciding a series of challenges brought by defense lawyers, including whether to exclude confessions that were key to the government’s case. ADVERTISEMENT Ms. Escallier’s approval of the plea agreement, which was reached between prosecutors and the defendants over two years of negotiations, had appeared to resolve the long-running case of the men, who have been in U.S. custody since 2003. The military judge was preparing to question Mr. Mohammed, possibly as soon as Wednesday, about whether he understood and voluntarily agreed with the plea. Mr. Austin was traveling abroad at the time the deal was approved and returned to the United States later that day. By then, prosecutors in the case had told family members of those killed in the attacks about the agreement, and some reacted with disappointment and anger that a death sentence was no longer possible. On Friday, those families expressed appreciation for Mr. Austin’s intervention. “This is a really welcome development,” said Terry Strada, whose husband, Tom Strada, a bond broker, was killed at the World Trade Center. “I’m happy to see the Pentagon getting involved. And glad the death penalty is back on the table. Otherwise, how could we be assured some administration would not commute their sentence or swap them in the future?” “Thank god,” said Kathleen Vigiano, a former police officer whose New York police detective husband, Joseph, and firefighter brother-in-law, John, were both killed at the World Trade Center. She said she had long been eager for a Sept. 11 trial to answer questions about “how this was planned, and who knew what.” ADVERTISEMENT She called the announcement a gift for the family, which was celebrating the 84th birthday of her husband and brother-in-law’s mother, Jeanette Vigiano. “It was a great birthday present for her,” she said. Mr. Austin’s action was met with disbelief by lawyers at Guantánamo Bay, who had negotiated the plea deal across 27 months, even as they were preparing for an eventual trial. “I am respectfully and profoundly disappointed that after all of these years the government still has not learned the lessons of this case, and the mischief that results from disregarding due process and fair play,” said Gary D. Sowards, Mr. Mohammed’s lead lawyer. A senior Pentagon official said that the decision was the secretary’s alone, and that the White House had no involvement. The official said Mr. Austin had never supported a plea deal and wanted the military commission trials to proceed. Republican leaders had been pushing to overturn the deal. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the longtime Republican leader, called the agreement “a revolting abdication of the government’s responsibility to defend America and provide justice.” ADVERTISEMENT Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas called the deal “disgraceful and an insult to the victims of the attacks,” and introduced legislation intended to nullify it. But Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, hailed the plea agreement as a “small measure of justice and finality to the victims and their loved ones.” Ms. Escallier, the official who approved the agreement, had been on the job for less than a year. She had been a career Army lawyer who retired in 2021 after 32 years of service. She provided legal advice on the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and other issues there, and she was the senior lawyer in the subsequent campaign to defeat the Islamic State. Although Mr. Austin relieved her of oversight of the Sept. 11 case, he left her in charge of the other cases at Guantánamo Bay, including the other capital case, against a man who is accused of plotting Al Qaeda’s bombing of the U.S.S. Cole warship. The military judge in that case has set an October 2025 trial date for the defendant, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the attack, which killed 17 U.S. sailors off Yemen.
