NASA’s Perseverance rover finds its first possible hint of ancient life on Mars,"NASA’s Perseverance rover finds its first possible hint of ancient life on Mars  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	The discovery builds the case for bringing pieces of Mars back to Earth for future studyPerseverance examined this Mars rock on July 21. The leopard spot–like features speckling the clay-colored part of the rock resemble structures in Earth rocks that are associated with life.MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASABy Lisa GrossmanJuly 25, 2024 at 7:52 pmNASA’s Perseverance rover has bagged its first hint of ancient microbes on Mars.“We’re not able to say that this is a sign of life,” says Perseverance deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif.  “But this is the most compelling sample we’ve found yet.”The rover drilled up the sample on July 21 from a reddish rock, dubbed Cheyava Falls after a feature at the Grand Canyon. It is the first piece of Mars that Perseverance has examined that contains organic molecules, the building blocks of life, project scientist Ken Farley of Caltech reported July 25 at the 10th International Conference on Mars in Pasadena.This isn’t the first sign of organics on Mars — the Curiosity rover detected organic molecules in a region called Gale Crater in 2014 (SN: 12/16/14). But scientists have struggled to identify organics since Perseverance landed in an ancient dried-up lake called Jezero Crater in 2021, says Stack Morgan (SN: 2/17/21).Adding to the excitement, the reddish rock is speckled with little white spots with black rims. “They look like a tricolored leopard spot,” Stack Morgan says.Perseverance examined the spots with instruments that can identify their chemical contents and found that the rims contain iron phosphate molecules. On Earth, rings with similar texture and chemistry are associated with ancient microbial life. The chemical reactions that create the rings can be an energy source for microbes.“They don’t require life, of course, and that’s an important caveat,” Stack Morgan says. “But based on our experience with similar things on Earth, there is a possibility that life could have been involved, and these could have a biological origin.”The rock has other confusing features that muddy the picture of how it formed, Stack Morgan says. It is shot through with white veins of calcium sulfate. These veins are filled with millimeter-sized crystals of olivine, a mineral that forms from magma. The inclusion of both the spots and these volcanic features in the same rock is “a little bit mysterious,” Stack Morgan says, as they point to different origins. Figuring out how the rock formed could help tell how likely it is to have had the right conditions and temperatures to host biology.Planetary scientist Paul Byrne thinks we should be circumspect about the finding.“Could this truly be a biosignature? Yes. And if it is, then it really is the kind of society-altering discovery that the discovery of truly extraterrestrial life would be,” says Byrne, of Washington University in St. Louis. But it’s also possible that the spots came from something other than life, “in which case all this is is an interesting example of water-rock chemistry.”The only way to find out for sure is to bring the rock home. A big part of Perseverance’s mission is to collect samples from interesting rocks for a future spacecraft to return to Earth, where they can be studied in more sophisticated laboratories than a rover can carry on its back. Perseverance has thrown everything it has at this rock already, Stack Morgan says.But funding uncertainty has recently put the program, known as Mars Sample Return, on hold (SN: 5/8/24).“With this sample, the rationale for MSR is strengthened even more, and should I hope motivate NASA to commit to pulling off this project sooner rather than later,” Byrne says.Stack Morgan says the rover team is carrying on despite the budget uncertainty.“We have a mission to carry out, and a job to do: collecting compelling samples,” Stack Morgan says. “It can only be our hope that the samples that we collect are compelling enough to justify the cost of Mars Sample Return. I think with this exciting sample, that really hits that home.”Questions or comments on this article? E-mail us at feedback@sciencenews.org   Reprints FAQJPL-Caltech.

Sepsis tests take days  putting patients at risk. A new method may cut wait time,"Sepsis test could cut diagnosis time from days to minutes  Scientists say a new test for sepsis could cut diagnosis times from days to minutes.Detecting the deadly illness is difficult because the symptoms are nondescript.Current tests can take as long as 48 hours - problematic with an illness where every second counts.Peter Ghazal, from Cardiff University's Project Sepsis, said early detection ""dramatically improves"" chances of survival.""We're very excited. We think we can actually move this at least within five years, but hopefully before then, to actually being used in a clinical setting,"" he said.It is estimated five million people die every year from the illness worldwide, which occurs when the body responds to an infection by injuring its own tissues and organs.In Wales there are about 2,900 deaths annually.Nicola Madoc-Jones' daughter Edie developed sepsis after being born prematurely at 23 weeks.""They suspected she had sepsis so what they do is they take blood cultures, but unfortunately the results of the blood cultures take up to 48 hours,"" she said.""And we don't have those hours to spare.""Two-and-a-half years later, Edie is a strong toddler but between 30 and 40% of premature babies suffering from sepsis will not survive.The researchers have been trying to pick up signals in the blood from the ""chatter of the immune system"" to see if a patient is going to become sick.This is done by conducting ""millions"" of experiments on small volumes of blood. Researchers can then decipher signals from the chatter that indicate a patient is infected.""This is a chatter that occurs very early on, so days before the current tests actually give you any signal,"" Prof Ghazal said. ""This is something that can be used as a very early warning to pick up in terms of a clinical diagnosis for sepsis.""""The test that we're looking at could be done within minutes to hours from first suspecting a patient might be septic,"" he said.""If you don't detect sepsis in a patient, you can lose a life within hours, so the early recognition and the administration of antibiotics dramatically improves outcome in terms of survival.""Copyright 2024 BBC.

Tomba del Cerbero: Archaeologists unseal 2 000-year-old tomb in Italy,"Tomba del Cerbero: Archaeologists unseal 2,000-year-old tomb in Italy  In Giugliano in Italy, archaeologists were taken aback while examining the interior of the Tomba del Cerbero. The experts made a surprising discovery during their investigation using a microcamera.They found that it was feasible to physically unseal and open the 2,000-year-old stone coffin, also known as a sarcophagus, which had remained untouched for centuries (Photo: Superintendence archaeology fine arts & landscape for the naples metropolitan area) In 2023, archaeologists made a remarkable discovery in Giugliano when they unearthed the perimeter of an ancient necropolis. This finding led them to uncover a structure that was later identified as the entrance to a chamber tomb, now known as the 'tomb of Cerberus.' Upon further investigation, the archaeologists were astounded by the presence of a captivating fresco within the tomb. The fresco showcased Cerberus, the legendary three-headed dog from ancient Greek mythology. (Photo: Superintendence archaeology fine arts & landscape for the Naples metropolitan area) Guigliano, a town situated in the Campania region of Italy, has a rich history dating back to ancient times. The area was settled by Greek colonizers during the period spanning the 8th and 7th centuries BC.Archaeologists from the Superintendency of Archaeology, Fine Arts, and Landscape made a startling discovery when they uncovered a tomb containing remarkably well-preserved bodies. The team was astonished not only by the condition of the remains but also by the unique preservation technique employed. The mummies, which have yet to be publicly showcased through images, were treated with a distinctive mixture of herbs.

Wayanad's deadly landslides: Why climate change can not be ignored,"Climate change, extreme weather: What made Wayanad landslides so deadly  Listen to StoryKerala's Wayanad district has been struck by one of the most devastating landslides in recent memory, triggered by incessant monsoon rains. The tragedy, which unfolded in the early hours of July 30, 2024, has claimed over 150 lives and left many injured, with the death toll expected to rise further as rescue operations continue.  Indian Army and rescue forces are currently engaged in relief operations across the affected areas.       Wayanad: Rescue operation underway after a landslide triggered by heavy monsoon rains, in Wayanad district. (PTI Photo) Kerala, known for its high monsoon rainfall, receives an average of 3,107 mm of rain annually, with 75% occurring during the June-September monsoon season. The state's unique geography, bounded by the Arabian Sea to the west and the Western Ghats to the east, makes it particularly susceptible to heavy rains. However, experts argue that factors beyond meteorology, such as climate change and unplanned development, are exacerbating the situation.Dr. Akshay Deoras, Research Scientist at the University of Reading, UK, points out the stark contrast in rainfall patterns across Kerala this season. While some districts experienced above-average rainfall, others, including Wayanad, recorded below-average precipitation. This spatial variability, Dr. Deoras suggests, could intensify with continued global warming.       Wayanad: Rescue operation underway after a landslide triggered by heavy monsoon rains, in Wayanad district, Tuesday, July 30, 2024. At least 123 people were killed and dozens are still feared trapped in the accident. (PTI Photo) The state has witnessed a steady rise in extreme weather events over the past decade, including Cyclone Ockhi in 2017 and devastating floods in 2018 and 2019. According to the report ‘A review on the extreme rainfall studies in India,’ the frequency and intensity of extreme monsoon downpours in India have increased over the past 50 years, despite significant inter-annual variability. Trends indicate that extreme rainfall events are likely to continue increasing in the coming decades. Climate scientists attribute this trend to human-induced climate change, which has led to an increase in extreme rainfall events (EREs) associated with monsoons, thunderstorms, and localized cloudbursts.Mariam Zachariah, Research Associate at Imperial College London, explains that climate change is drastically altering Wayanad's rainfall patterns. The once cool, humid environment is now characterised by drier, hotter summers and intense monsoon downpours, increasing the risk of landslides. ""This change has increased the risk of landslides. Dry soils absorb less water and heavy rainfalls cause run-offs that can lead to landslides, such as the ones we've seen this week,” said Mariam Zachariah.Mahesh Palawat, Vice President of Meteorology and Climate Change at Skymet Weather, notes that monsoon patterns have become more erratic, with rains now resembling pre-monsoon characteristics. He attributes this change to rising air and ocean temperatures, particularly the rapid warming of the Arabian Sea, which pumps more moisture into the atmosphere.The role of unplanned development in exacerbating these climate-induced disasters cannot be overlooked. Professor Y P Sundriyal from HNB Garhwal University emphasised the need for scientifically sound construction techniques in mountainous regions, highlighting the current gap between planning and implementation.The Western Ghats, classified as an ecologically fragile region, have seen significant land-use changes. A recent study by the Indian Institute of Science divided the 1.6 lakh sq km of ghats into four ecologically sensitive regions, pointing to the need for careful development planning.       Wayanad: A damaged jeep at an affected area following landslides triggered by heavy rain at Chooralmala, in Wayanad district, Kerala, Tuesday, July 30, 2024. At least 90 people were killed and 128 injured, according to officials. (PTI Photo) Experts like Roxy Mathew Koll from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, call for improved early warning systems and careful evaluation of land use changes in landslide-prone areas. Prof Anjal Prakash from the Indian School of Business suggests implementing climate-resilient infrastructure and promoting sustainable land management practices to mitigate the impact of these disasters.Deforestation, rapid urbanisation, unplanned development, and poor planning are significant factors that are exacerbating the climate crisis in India. It is evident that development plans and human interference are not complementing the ecological balance of the mountainous terrain.The devastating landslides in Wayanad are a reminder of the critical importance of balancing development with environmental conservation, particularly in ecologically sensitive regions like the Western Ghats.",True,False,False
People born blind develop unique fingerprint-like pattern in the brain,"A beautiful mind: People born blind develop fingerprint-like pattern in the brain  Listen to StoryA new study led by Georgetown University neuroscientists has revealed that the brain in individuals born blind develops a unique connectivity pattern, similar to a fingerprint. This discovery, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), has significant implications for understanding brain development and could pave the way for personalized rehabilitation and sight restoration strategies.For decades, researchers have known that the visual cortex in people born blind responds to various stimuli, including touch, smell, sound localisation, memory recall, and language. However, the lack of a common thread linking these tasks has puzzled scientists. The new study, led by postdoctoral researcher Dr. Lenia Amaral and Assistant Professor Dr. Ella Striem-Amit, offers a compelling explanation: individual differences in brain organization.""We don’t see this level of variation in the visual cortex connectivity among individuals who can see. The connectivity of the visual cortex is usually fairly consistent,"" said Dr. Striem-Amit, who leads the Sensory and Motor Plasticity Lab at Georgetown. ""The connectivity pattern in people born blind is more different across people, like an individual fingerprint, and is stable over time — so much so that the individual person can be identified from the connectivity pattern.""       Understanding each person’s connectivity may be crucial. (Photo: Getty) The study involved a small sample of individuals born blind who underwent repeated functional MRI scans over two years. Researchers used a neuroimaging technique to analyze neural connectivity across the brain. They found that the visual cortex in these individuals showed remarkable stability in its connectivity patterns over time, regardless of the task at hand.""Our study found that these patterns did not change significantly based on the task — whether participants were localizing sounds, identifying shapes, or simply resting. Instead, the connectivity patterns were unique to each individual and remained stable over the two-year study period,"" explained Dr. Amaral.Dr. Striem-Amit emphasized that these findings highlight the brain's plasticity and its ability to develop in diverse ways, especially in the absence of sight. ""Our findings suggest that experiences after birth shape the diverse ways our brains can develop. Brain plasticity in these cases frees the brain to develop, possibly even for different uses of the visual cortex among different people born blind,"" she said.The researchers propose that understanding each person’s individual connectivity may be crucial for tailoring rehabilitation and sight restoration solutions for individuals with blindness, based on their unique brain connectivity patterns.This study not only advances our understanding of brain development in the absence of sight but also opens new avenues for personalized medical interventions for the blind.",True,True,True
Asteroid on which Earth crashed a spacecraft had a mysterious origin,"Asteroid on which Earth crashed a spacecraft hides a mysterious origin story  Listen to StoryIn a groundbreaking planetary defense test in 2022, Nasa's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft collided with the asteroid Dimorphos, providing scientists with high-resolution images of Dimorphos and its larger companion, Didymos. These images have enabled researchers to delve into the complex history of these near-Earth objects and gain new insights into the formation of binary asteroid systems—where a primary asteroid is orbited by a secondary moonlet.The analysis of the craters and surface strength on Didymos suggests it formed approximately 12.5 million years ago, likely originating from the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter before being knocked into the inner solar system.        This mission has significantly advanced our understanding of binary asteroid systems. (Photo: Nasa) Dimorphos, on the other hand, is much younger, forming around 300,000 years ago. This younger asteroid is believed to have been created from material ejected from Didymos due to its rapid rotation, influenced by the YORP effect, which is driven by sunlight impacting its uneven surface.Astronomer Maurizio Pajola from the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) in Italy, lead author of one of five studies published in Nature Communications, explained that both Didymos and Dimorphos are aggregates of rocky fragments resulting from the catastrophic destruction of a parent asteroid. The presence of large boulders on both asteroids supports this theory, as such boulders could not have formed from impacts on their surfaces alone.Didymos, with a diameter of about 780 meters, and Dimorphos, about 170 meters wide, are classified as ""rubble pile"" asteroids. Their surfaces are covered with boulders, with the largest on Dimorphos being the size of a school bus and the largest on Didymos as big as a soccer field. Planetary geologist Olivier Barnouin from Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory noted that the surfaces of both asteroids are weak, much weaker than loose sand.The DART mission's impact on Dimorphos at 14,000 miles per hour successfully altered its orbit around Didymos, demonstrating the potential of kinetic force to change the path of a space object. This mission has significantly advanced our understanding of binary asteroid systems, which make up about 10-15% of near-Earth asteroids. The data collected will aid in future planetary defense strategies and enhance our knowledge of asteroid formation and evolution.The findings from the DART mission point to the complexity of asteroid systems and the importance of continued observation and study. As Olivier Barnouin remarked, each new observation helps scientists learn more about the intricate processes that shape these celestial bodies, providing critical information for both planetary defense and our broader understanding of the solar system's history.",True,True,True
Scientists mind-control mice in world's first experiment,"Scientists use magnetism to mind-control mice in world's first experiment  Listen to StoryIn a world-first experiment, researchers at the Center for Nanomedicine within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) and Yonsei University in South Korea have successfully demonstrated the ability to control specific brain regions in mice using magnetic fields. This breakthrough, known as Nano-MIND (Magnetogenetic Interface for NeuroDynamics) technology, opens up new possibilities for understanding and manipulating complex brain functions such as cognition, emotion, and motivation.The Nano-MIND technology allows for wireless, remote, and precise modulation of specific deep brain neural circuits using magnetism. This innovative approach leverages magnetic fields and magnetized nanoparticles to selectively activate targeted brain circuits, offering a significant advancement over existing methods of brain manipulation.       Overview of nano-MIND technology - regulation of higher-order brain functions through selective control of specific neurons and brain circuits. (Photo: IBS) In their experiments, the research team demonstrated the technology's capabilities by activating specific neurons in different brain regions of mice. One notable achievement was the activation of inhibitory GABA receptors in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), which is responsible for maternal behaviours. When these neurons were stimulated in non-maternal female mice, the animals exhibited significantly increased nurturing behaviours, mimicking those of maternal mice.The researchers also successfully regulated feeding behaviours by targeting motivation circuits in the lateral hypothalamus. Activation of inhibitory neurons in this area resulted in a remarkable 100% increase in appetite and feeding behaviours in mice. Conversely, when excitatory neurons were activated, the mice showed a more than 50% reduction in appetite and feeding behaviours.       The findings could be widely used in research to understand brain functions. (Photo: Getty) Dr. CHEON Jinwoo, Director of the Center for Nanomedicine, expressed enthusiasm about the potential applications of this technology: ""This is the world's first technology to freely control specific brain regions using magnetic fields. We expect it to be widely used in research to understand brain functions, sophisticated artificial neural networks, two-way BCI technologies, and new treatments for neurological disorders.""The Nano-MIND technology represents a significant step forward in neuroscience research and could have far-reaching implications for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and the treatment of neurological disorders. By allowing researchers to selectively activate desired brain circuits and bidirectionally modulate higher brain functions, this technology paves the way for more precise and less invasive methods of studying and potentially treating various brain-related conditions.As research in this field continues to advance, it is likely that we will see further developments in our understanding of the brain's complex functions and new therapeutic approaches for neurological disorders.",True,True,True
Nisar  the joint Nasa-Isro mission  won't launch in 2024,"Nasa finishing work on Nisar mission but Isro can't launch it till February 2025  Listen to StoryNasa's work on the radar antenna reflector for the Nasa-Isro Synthetic Aperture Radar (Nisar) satellite is nearing completion in California. The American space agency said that the testing is currently underway to ensure that this critical hardware component will deploy correctly following its launch from India. Nisar mission represents a significant collaboration between Nasa and Isro, combining the expertise and resources of both organizations to advance our understanding of Earth's dynamic systems. The drum-shaped reflector, measuring about 39 feet (12 meters) across, is one of Nasa’s key contributions to this joint mission with the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).The reflector is designed to transmit and receive microwave signals to and from Earth's surface, enabling Nisar to scan nearly all the planet’s land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days to gather essential scientific data.        The reflector will be reintegrated with the radar system by teams from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. (Photo: Nasa) This capability will provide valuable insights into various Earth processes, including ecosystem disturbances, ice-sheet collapse, and natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and landslides.In March, the reflector was transported back from India to a specialised facility in California. There, reflective tape was applied, and other precautionary measures were taken to mitigate temperature increases that could potentially affect the deployment of the reflector from its stowed configuration before beginning science operations.After the successful completion of testing, Nasa plans to transport the reflector to an Isro facility in Bengaluru, India. At this facility, the reflector will be reintegrated with the radar system by teams from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and Isro. During this period, a launch readiness date will be determined by Isro in coordination with Nasa.However, it is important to note that the Nisar launch cannot occur between early October 2024 and early February 2025. Nasa said that launching during this window would subject the satellite to periods of alternating sunlight and shadows due to the Sun's position, causing temperature fluctuations that could affect the deployment of Nisar’s boom and radar antenna reflector.Once operational, Nisar will provide unprecedented data to help scientists monitor and respond to environmental changes and natural disasters, ultimately contributing to global efforts in climate science and disaster management.",True,True,False
July 21  2024 was the hottest day on Earth  record broken on July 22,"July 21, 2024 was the hottest day on Earth. The record was broken on July 22  Listen to StoryOn July 22, 2024, Earth experienced its hottest day on record, with the global average temperature reaching a staggering 17.15°C, according to NASA's analysis of global daily temperature data. This new record surpassed the previous high of 17.09°C set just a day earlier on July 21. July 23 also exceeded the previous record, highlighting a concerning trend of escalating global temperatures.These unprecedented temperatures are part of a long-term warming trend driven by human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases. NASA's extensive data collection and analysis capabilities have been crucial in monitoring these changes. ""In a year that has been the hottest on record to date, these past two weeks have been particularly brutal,"" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. ""Through our over two dozen Earth-observing satellites and over 60 years of data, NASA is providing critical analyses of how our planet is changing and how local communities can prepare, adapt, and stay safe.""

(Photo: Nasa) The preliminary findings come from data analyses using the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), and the Goddard Earth Observing System Forward Processing (GEOS-FP) systems. These systems combine millions of global observations from land, sea, air, and satellite instruments using atmospheric models. GEOS-FP provides rapid, near-real-time weather data, while MERRA-2 ensures the use of the highest quality observations.The daily global average temperature values from MERRA-2 for the years 1980-2022 are shown in white, values for 2023 in pink, and values from 2024 through June in red. The daily global temperature values from July 1 to 23, 2024, from GEOS-FP are shown in purple. These results align with an independent analysis from the European Union's Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, both indicating a significant increase in global temperatures.       People crowd a public beach during a hot day amid a heatwave, in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria.

Their analysis, based on the GISTEMP record, uses surface instrumental data to provide a long-term view of global temperature changes at monthly and annual resolutions dating back to the late 19th century.The rising temperatures point to the urgent need for global action to mitigate climate change. As the planet continues to warm, it is anticipated that temperature records will continue to be broken, highlighting the critical importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing sustainable practices to protect our planet.",True,True,False
Life on Earth began 1.5 years earlier than science previously estimated,"Life on Earth began 1.5 billion years earlier than previously thought  Listen to StoryAn international team of scientists has uncovered environmental evidence of the earliest experiments in the evolution of complex life on Earth. This finding, led by researchers from Cardiff University, challenges the widely accepted timeline that animals first emerged around 635 million years ago.The team discovered evidence of a much earlier ecosystem in the Franceville Basin near Gabon on the Atlantic coast of Central Africa, dating back over 1.5 billion years earlier than previously thought. Their study, published in Precambrian Research, describes a unique episode of underwater volcanic activity following the collision of two continents, creating a nutrient-rich environment conducive to early biological evolution.Dr. Ernest Chi Fru, the lead author and a Reader at Cardiff University’s School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, highlighted the significance of phosphorus availability in the environment as a key component in the evolution of life. ""The availability of phosphorus in the environment is thought to be a key component in the evolution of life on Earth, especially in the transition from simple single-cell organisms to complex organisms like animals and plants,"" Dr. Chi Fru explained.The Cardiff-led team identified a link between environmental change and nutrient enrichment, which may have triggered the evolution of large-sized fossils of macroorganisms from this period. These fossils, the earliest of their kind in the geologic record, have been a subject of debate among scientists.Geochemical analysis of marine sedimentary rocks deposited 2.1 billion years ago provided new insights into these large fossils. Dr. Chi Fru elaborated, ""We think that the underwater volcanoes, which followed the collision and suturing of the Congo and S£o Francisco cratons into one main body, further restricted and even cut off this section of water from the global ocean to create a nutrient-rich shallow marine inland sea.""This isolated environment allowed cyanobacterial photosynthesis to thrive, leading to the oxygenation of local seawater and the generation of a substantial food resource. This, in turn, provided sufficient energy to promote an increase in body size and more complex behavior in primitive animal-like life forms.However, the restricted nature of this water mass and the hostile conditions beyond it likely prevented these early life forms from spreading globally. The study suggests a two-step evolution of complex life on Earth: the first major rise in atmospheric oxygen content 2.1 billion years ago, followed by a second rise 1.5 billion years later.This discovery not only pushes back the timeline for the emergence of complex life but also provides crucial insights into the environmental conditions that facilitated this significant evolutionary leap.",True,False,False
A secret Chinese plane is flying in space. No one knows what it does,"A secret Chinese plane is flying in space. No one knows what it does  Listen to StoryChina's shadowy, uncrewed reusable spacecraft, which launches atop a rocket booster and lands at a secretive military airfield, is most likely testing technology but could also be used for manipulating or retrieving satellites, experts say.The spacecraft, on its third mission, was in June observed releasing an object, moving several kilometres away and then manoeuvring back to within a few hundred metres of it.""It's obvious that it has a military application, including, for example, closely inspecting objects of the enemy or disabling them,"" said Marco Langbroek, a lecturer in optical space situational awareness at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.""But it also has non-military applications. Gaining experience with this kind of grab and release is good if you want to for instance ... refuel your own satellites.""As militaries worldwide develop complex satellite networks, a reusable spacecraft that can interfere with them could have immense value, Langbroek and three other experts said.China has never disclosed what technologies the spacecraft has tested, nor has the spaceplane been publicly photographed since it began operating. The U.S. first launched its uncrewed Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab X-37B spaceplane in 2010, while Russia has recently launched several satellites that U.S. officials suspect may be weapons, a charge Russia has denied.China's spaceplane is most likely testing technology, much like the X-37B, said Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability at  the Secure World Foundation thinktank in Washington, D.C.""I don't think that either has a whole lot of military utility, to be honest,"" Samson said. ""I am guessing that both are technology demonstrators."" China's ministry of defence did not immediately respond to a request for comment. State media outlet Xinhua has noted the launches and landings of the spaceplane, which it refers to as a ""reusable test spacecraft"".The current flight of the Chinese spaceplane began in December 2023. The previous mission, which also involved putting a separate object in space and retrieving it, launched in August 2022 and lasted 276 days, according to tracking data. Its first flight was in September 2020 and lasted two days.""We see breathtaking advancements by the People's Republic of China in space,"" said General Stephen Whiting, commander of U.S. Space Command, noting that his organisation did not know what objects the spaceplane had released.""Any space activity that they undertake, we assume has some dual use in the national security realm,"" Whiting said. ""We're always interested in understanding what could that dual use be, and trying to make sure that we have a good knowledge of that.""Little is known about China's spaceplane.Tracking data show it launches from Jiuquan, in north central China, and lands at an airfield in Lop Nur, in the country's Xinjiang region. The airfield is linked to a site once used for nuclear testing and is tightly controlled by the military, said Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.Data show it has changed its altitude from common orbits of roughly 350 kms (217 miles) to 600 kms and back, he said.It is thought to be roughly the same size and shape as the X-37B, which is about 30 feet (9.14 m) long and has spent as long as 908 days in orbit at altitudes of up to 38,000 km.Given it has spent months in space, China's spaceplane is also assumed to be uncrewed, although it has flown atop China's only human-rated booster, the Long March 2F.The U.S. Space Shuttle, which operated from 1981 to 2011, was about the size of a 737 airliner and could carry a crew of seven but spent no longer than 17 days in orbit. The Soviet Union developed a large crewed spaceplane called Buran, which made one automated orbital flight, a 3-hour journey in 1988.The Space Shuttle performed 10 classified missions out of 135 flights, leading the Soviet Union to consider it a military spaceplane and develop Buran, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies.""We don't want to look at this (Chinese) spaceplane the same way the Soviets looked at the Shuttle,"" he said. ""A lot of these are just experiments rather than well-thought-out military platforms.""The apparent experiments in orbit with releasing and retrieving objects mirror those of the United States' X-37B.The X-37B's missions have all been classified, but are described as taking experiments to space and back, and exploring ""reusable vehicle technologies that support long-term space objectives"", according to Boeing.How well those experiments go could influence the duration of the mission. Testing a cutting-edge sensor, for instance, could yield intelligence so useful that the government may want to keep it in space for longer before bringing it back to the lab, McDowell said.Inspecting or disabling an adversary's satellites is another potential military capability. Some countries, including the U.S., China, India and Russia, already have ground-based anti-satellite missiles.       China in 2021 test flew a hypersonic glide vehicle. (Photo: AFP) Orbital weapons have long been taboo, and weapons of mass destruction in space are banned by the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.China in 2021 test flew a hypersonic glide vehicle as part of a Cold War-era concept known as a fractional orbital bombardment system, which launches a warhead partially into orbit, allowing it to strike with little warning from unusual trajectories.But attacking from orbit using a spaceplane offers little advantage over ballistic missiles or cruise missiles, Lewis said.Two senior Indian military officers, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media, said that although the exact purpose of the Chinese spaceplane was unclear, India was concerned.""The spacecraft in question is definitely alarming,"" said one of the officers. ""Things like this can always have dual purposes. India is keenly watching.""",True,True,True
Discovery in Ladakh could forever change search for alien life Ladakh's harsh climate  characterised by high UV radiation  extreme temperature fluctuations  and limited water availability  makes it an ideal terrestrial analogue for Martian conditions.,"Discovery in Ladakh could forever change search for alien life  Listen to StoryScientists have made a new discovery in Ladakh that could revolutionise the search for extraterrestrial life. Researchers from the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) have identified magnetofossils - fossil remains of magnetic particles produced by magnetotactic bacteria - in rock varnish layers in the region known as India's ""cold desert.""This finding, published in Planetary and Space Science, suggests that biotic processes play a crucial role in the formation of rock varnish, demonstrating how life can thrive in extreme environments. Rock varnish, a dark-coloured natural coating rich in manganese, iron, and clay minerals, forms on rock surfaces and fractures in extremely dry and cold environments, and is believed to provide nutritional support to microbiota.Ladakh's harsh climate, characterised by high UV radiation, extreme temperature fluctuations, and limited water availability, makes it an ideal terrestrial analogue for Martian conditions.Dr. Amritpal Singh Chaddha and Dr. Anupam Sharma, lead researchers at BSIP, analyzed rock varnish samples from Ladakh using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Their analysis revealed nanochains of magnetofossils and higher concentrations of oxidized manganese and carboxylic acid, indicating organic signatures.The similarity between Ladakh's rock varnish and that observed on Mars during Nasa's Perseverance rover operations inspired this research. The study's findings highlight the potential of rock varnish as an archive of ancient environmental records and a valuable resource for astrobiological studies.This discovery has significant implications for future space exploration. By identifying biotic signatures in rock varnish, scientists can better target potential biosignatures on Mars and other celestial bodies, enhancing the search for extraterrestrial life. The research provides crucial insights for planning future missions by space agencies like Isro, particularly in Mars exploration where identifying habitable environments is a primary objective.As we continue to explore the possibilities of life beyond Earth, studies like this from Ladakh serve as stepping stones, bridging our understanding of extreme terrestrial environments with the potential for life in the cosmos.",True,False,False

Butchered animal bones indicate earliest human presence in southern South America,"Feedback   Thursday, August 15, 2024 					18/07/24   4:40 pm			 													   Argentina    Armadillo    Fossil bones    Glyptodonts    Ice Age    Neosclerocalyptus Fossil bones found in Argentina of a large armadillo relative with cut marks suggestive of butchering indicate humans were present in southern South America some 21,000 years ago, according to researchers, earlier than previously thought.The bones were from a large armored plant-eating mammal named Neosclerocalyptus, part of a group called glyptodonts that inhabited the Americas for more than 30 million years before going extinct at the end of the Ice Age about 10,000 years ago.The researchers said the cut marks on the bones appear to have been made by people using stone tools. That represents strong evidence for the presence of our species, Homo sapiens, though no human fossils were found at the site, they added.Glyptodonts are related to modern-day armadillos, though much larger – some species as big as a small car. They had a large, bony carapace that covered much of the body – resembling a turtle shell – as well as armor atop the head, a large and strongly built tail and short limbs.Neosclerocalyptus was one of the smaller species. The individual in this study was about 6 feet long (180 cm) and roughly 660 pounds (300 kilograms).The marks on the bones were found on the pelvis, tail and body armor.“The placement of these cut marks is consistent with a butchering sequence that targets areas of dense flesh, that is, the cut marks were not randomly distributed but focused on those skeletal elements that harbored large muscle packs like the pelvis and the tail. This is a typical pattern observed during a butchering process,” said anthropologist Miguel Delgado of National University of La Plata, senior author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.The shapes of the cut marks are consistent with those created using types of stone tools called flakes and hammerstones, Delgado added.Anthropologist and study lead author Mariano del Papa of National University of La Plata said that “the only ones capable of making them (these marks) were humans.”The timeline for the peopling of the Americas has been a matter of debate, with some recent discoveries indicating humans had arrived much earlier than previously thought. The role of people in the extinction of many large mammals in the Americas also has been a subject of controversy. The Neosclerocalyptus fossils are among the oldest evidence of human interaction with these large Ice Age animals.The new findings represent the oldest evidence of both the presence of Homo sapiens and human interaction with large animals in southern South America during the height of the last Ice Age, a time known as the Last Glacial Maximum, and one of the oldest in all of South America, the researchers said.“Until recently, the traditional model suggested that modern humans (Homo sapiens) entered the Americas 16,000 years ago, so most of the archaeological evidence was framed during that period. Since a few years ago, new evidence has been found indicating an earlier human presence,” Delgado said.“Currently, we know that in South America reliable evidence was recovered in Brazil from 23,000 years ago, but it’s worth noting that contemporaneous sites were found in North America with material dated between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, and even earlier sites were also found in Central America dated between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago,” Delgado added.The Neosclerocalyptus fossils were unearthed in 2015 from the banks of the Reconquista River near the town of Merlo in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, dating to the Pleistocene epoch. A method called radiocarbon dating determined that the fossils were about 21,000 years old.National University of La Plata paleontologist and study co-author Martin de Los Reyes said, “This would be the first evidence of humans in Argentina and the Southern Cone of South America.”“We are shifting the traditional paradigm that speaks of a specific moment of human arrival in the Americas,” Delgado added.(Reuters)05/06/24   9:19 am03/11/23   2:08 pm23/11/23   2:57 pm05/06/24   8:38 am29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pmWe will send you breaking news right to your inbox",True,True,False

Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad explored the enzyme’s suitability for therapeutic applications.   Photo Credit: V. Praveen Kumar, LVPEI Scientists from the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, have developed an enhanced genome-editing system that can modify DNA more precisely and more efficiently than existing CRISPR-based technologies.CRISPR occurs naturally in some bacteria, as a part of their immune system that limits infections by recognising and destroying viral DNA. In Nobel-prize winning work, scientists repurposed this bacterial defence mechanism to develop a novel approach for editing the genomes of higher-order organisms.Today, using CRISPR-Cas9, researchers can add, remove or alter specific DNA sequences in the genome of animals. This system has been used in various fields, including in agriculture — to improve the nutritional value of plants and increase the yield — and in healthcare to diagnose several diseases and treat genetic disorders.The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool uses a guide-RNA (gRNA) designed to find and bind to a specific part of the target genome. The gRNA directs an enzyme, Cas9, to the target site, which is followed by a short DNA sequence called protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Cas9 recognises and binds to the PAM sequence, and acts as a molecular scissor that snips some damaged DNA. This automatically triggers the cell’s DNA repair system, which repairs the snipped part to insert the correct DNA sequence.But the CRISPR-Cas9 system can also recognise and cut parts of the genome other than the intended portion. Such “off-target” effects are more common when using the SpCas9 enzyme derived from Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Scientists have been able to engineer versions of SpCas9 with higher fidelity but only at the cost of editing efficiency.To overcome these issues, researchers are exploring Cas9 enzymes from Francisella novicida bacteria. While this Cas9, called FnCas9, is highly precise, it has a low efficiency as well.To enhance it without compromising its specificity, researchers led by Debojyoti Chakraborty and Souvik Maiti at CSIR-IGIB modified and engineered new versions of FnCas9.The researchers tinkered with amino acids in FnCas9 that recognise and interact with the PAM sequence on the host genome. “By doing this, we increase the binding affinity of the Cas protein with the PAM sequence,” Dr. Chakraborty said. “The Cas9 can then sit on the DNA in a stronger configuration, and your gene editing becomes much more effective.”The researchers also engineered the enhanced FnCas9 to be more flexible and edit regions of the genome that are otherwise harder to access. “This opens up more avenues for gene editing,” Dr. Chakraborty said.Experiments to measure enzyme activity showed that enhanced FnCas9 cut target DNA at a higher rate compared to unmodified FnCas9.CRISPR-based tools for diagnostics and therapeutics rely on the ability of the system to recognise specific single-nucleotide changes in the DNA. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. Each nucleotide consists of a nucleobase, a phosphate group, and a sugar. Each nucleotide in DNA has one of four nucleobases: adenosine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. A single-nucleotide change is when just one nucleotide in the genome needs to be ‘repaired’.When the researchers tested the ability of enhanced FnCas9 to identify such changes in the genome, they found enFnCas9 outperformed unmodified FnCas9. An enhanced FnCas9-based diagnostic could target almost twice the number of changes compared to FnCas9, increasing the scope of detecting more disease-causing genetic changes.Once Dr. Chakraborty’s team had shown the increased efficiency and activity of the enhanced FnCas9 enzyme, a team led by Indumathi Mariappan at the L.V. Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad explored the enzyme’s suitability for therapeutic applications.The researchers used enhanced FnCas9 to edit the genome of human kidney and eye cells grown in lab dishes. It not only edited genes in these cells at a better rate than did SpCas9, it also showed negligible off-target effects.The team finally sought to understand whether enhanced FnCas9 is a viable option for treating genetic disorders. They tested the enzyme’s efficiency at correcting a genetic mutation that causes Leber congenital amaurosis type 2 (LCA2), a form of inherited blindness. A single mutation in the RPE65 gene results in the loss of expression of a protein called retinal pigment epithelial-specific (RPE65), resulting in severe vision loss.The team isolated skin cells from an individual with LCA2 carrying the RPE65 mutation, and reprogrammed these cells to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Such cells can be made to grow into any cell type in the human body. When the researchers differentiated the iPSCs into cells of the eye’s retina, the cells expressed negligible levels of RPE65 protein.The researchers delivered a CRISPR system with the enhanced FnCas9 enzyme into the individual’s iPSCs to correct the mutation responsible for low levels of this protein. When they sequenced the edited cells, they found that the CRISPR tool had corrected the mutation. The edited iPSCs when differentiated into retinal cells also showed normal levels of the RPE65 protein.Dr. Mariappan said the team was taken aback by the efficiency of the editing. Most of the iPSCs carried the edits, and when the researchers grew colonies from individual edited iPSCs, they found that two colonies showed 100% mutation correction.“We also examined the whole genome for off-target interactions and found only a few, of no major concern, as compared to several hits seen with other Cas9 proteins [we] examined,” she added.Previous reports have suggested that such person-specific retinal cells can be transplanted back into a person to treat inherited blindness conditions like LCA2.A group of U.S. researchers reported on May 6, 2024, in the New England Journal of Medicine that CRISPR injected directly into the eyes of people suffering from LCA2 has shown success in early clinical trials. But editing patient-specific stem cells and transplanting the mutation-corrected cells into patients is a safer option, according to Dr. Mariappan, “because this allows us to screen and confirm precise edits.”“The research community needed this precision” in the CRISPR system, Shailja Singh, a researcher at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, who uses CRISPR-based tools to model and study genetic diseases like sickle cell anaemia and β-thalassaemia, said. Such reduced off-target effects are critical for those who use CRISPR-based therapy to correct mutations, “so this is a very welcome approach.”Dr. Singh added that while a precise enzyme without any off-target effects is much-needed, the delivery system must also be equally proficient. According to her, researchers should next focus on precisely delivering this tool into the nuclei of the target cells.Dr. Chakraborty said the team is working on adapting the system to different delivery methods as well as reducing the size of the enFnCas9. “All these will come in the following studies,” he said.The team is also in contact with some Indian companies to scale up and manufacture therapeutic solutions for multiple genetic disorders . “This opens up the doors for not licensing from a foreign entity, which could be very, very expensive.”Dr. Mariappan agreed: “With indigenous intellectual property for such a high precision editor, we are now in a better position to develop newer therapeutics at affordable costs for people in low- and middle-income countries like ours.”Sneha Khedkar is a biologist turned freelance science journalist. genetics  Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Human DNA will have to be edited if humans are to settle on other planets,"Human DNA will have to be edited if humans are to settle on other planets   To enjoy additional benefitsCONNECT WITH US Published - July 27, 2024 01:33 pm IST  The potential applications of gene editing for allowing us to travel further are almost limitless. Representative image.   Photo Credit: Nicolas Lobos/Unsplash When considering human settlements on the Moon, Mars and further afield, much attention is given to the travel times, food and radiation risk. We’ll undoubtedly face a harsh environment in deep space and some thinkers have been pointing to genome editing as a way to ensure that humans can tolerate the severe conditions as they venture further into the solar system.In January, I was fortunate to attend a much-anticipated debate between astronomer royal Martin Rees and Mars exploration advocate Dr Robert Zubrin. The event at the British Interplanetary Society took on the topic of whether the exploration of Mars should be human or robotic. In a recent book called ‘The End of Astronauts’, Rees and co-author Donald Goldsmith outline the benefits of exploration of the solar system using robotic spacecraft and vehicles, without the expense and risk of sending humans along for the ride. Dr Zubrin supports human exploration. Where there was some agreement was over Rees’s advocacy of using gene editing technology to enable humans to overcome the immense challenges of becoming an interplanetary species.Our genome is all the DNA present in our cells. Since 2011, we have been able to easily and accurately edit genomes. First came a molecular tool called Crispr-Cas9, which today can be used in a high school lab for very little cost and has even been used on the International Space Station. Then came techniques called base and prime editing, through which miniscule changes can be made in the genome of any living organism. The potential applications of gene editing for allowing us to travel further are almost limitless. One of the most problematic hazards astronauts will encounter in deep space is a higher dosage of radiation, which can cause havoc with many processes in the body and increase the longer-term risk of cancer.Perhaps, using genome editing, we could insert genes into humans from plants and bacteria that are able to clean up radiation in the event of radioactive waste spills and nuclear fallout. It sounds like science fiction, but eminent thinkers such as Rees believe this is key to our advancement across the solar system.Identifying and then inserting genes into humans that slow down aging and counter cellular breakdown could also help. We could also engineer crops that resist the effects of exposure to radioactivity as crews will need to grow their own food. We could also personalise medicine to an astronaut’s needs based on their particular genetic makeup.Imagine a future where the human genome is so well understood it has become pliable under this new, personalised medicine.Tardigrades are microscopic animals sometimes referred to as “water bears”. Experiments have shown that these tiny creatures can tolerate extreme temperatures, pressures, high radiation and starvation. They can even tolerate the vacuum of space. Geneticists are eager to understand their genomes and a paper published in Nature sought to uncover the key genes and proteins that give the miniature creatures this extraordinary stress tolerance. If we could insert some of the genes involved into crops, could we make them tolerant to the highest levels of radiation and environmental stress? It’s worth exploring. Even more intriguing is whether inserting tardigrade genes into our own genome could make us more resilient to the harsh conditions in space. Scientists have already shown that human cells in the lab developed increased tolerance to X-ray radiation when tardigrade genes were inserted into them. Transferring genes from tardigrades is just one speculative example of how we might be able engineer humans and crops to be more suited to space travel.We’ll need much more research if scientists are ever to get to this stage. However, in the past, several governments have been keen to enforce tight restrictions on how genome editing is used, as well as on other technologies for inserting genes from one species into another. Germany and Canada are among the most cautious, but elsewhere restrictions seem to be relaxing. In November 2018, the Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced that he had created the first gene edited babies. He had introduced a gene into the unborn twins that confers resistance to HIV infection. The scientist was subsequently jailed. But he has since been released and allowed to carry out research again. In the new space race, certain countries may go to lengths with genome editing that other nations, especially in the west where restrictions are already tight, may not. Whoever wins would reap enormous scientific and economic benefits.If Rees and the other futurists are right, this field has the potential to advance our expansion into the cosmos. But society will need to agree to it. It’s likely there will be opposition, because of the deep-seated fears of altering the human species forever. And with base and prime editing now having advanced the precision of targeted gene editing, it’s clear that the technology is moving faster than the conversation.One country or another is likely to take the leap where others pull back from the brink. Only then will we find out just how viable these ideas really are. Until then, we can only speculate with curiosity, and perhaps excitement too.Sam McKee is associate tutor and a PhD candidate in the philosophy of science, Manchester Metropolitan University.

Photo Credit: ROV-Team/GEOMAR An unknown process is producing oxygen deep in the world’s oceans, where it is too dark for photosynthesis, scientists reported on July 22 in the journal Nature Geoscience. The finding has important implications because oxygen helps support life and the discovery implies the existence of previously unknown ecosystems.Many governments are also bound to take notice since one explanation for the oxygen is that polymetallic nodules are transporting electric charges that split water molecules around them, releasing oxygen. Polymetallic nodules are lumps of iron, manganese hydroxides, and rock partially submerged in many parts of the ocean floor. If their concentration exceeds 10 kg per sq. m, mining them is considered to be economically feasible — and many countries are planning to do so as a new resource.On July 22, Reuters reported an unnamed “top government scientist” saying India is planning to “apply for licences to explore for deep-sea minerals in the Pacific Ocean”. India’s Ministry of Earth Sciences is also currently building a submersible vehicle that will look for and mine similar resources in the Indian Ocean as part of its ‘Deep Ocean Mission’. The oxygen discovery raises questions about how deep-sea mining to extract polymetallic nodules will affect marine ecosystems.The scientists behind the study, from Germany, the U.K., and the U.S., were studying the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a part of the ocean floor off Mexico’s west coast. Covering an area larger than India, the Zone is considered to have the world’s highest concentration of polymetallic nodules, including 6 billion tonnes of manganese and more than 200 million tonnes each of copper and nickel.When the scientists were conducting experiments at a depth of 4 km, they noticed the oxygen concentration in some places rapidly increased instead of decreasing. They conducted follow-up studies in 2020 and 2021. In each case, they released a device from the surface that would land on the ocean floor, where it would isolate a small volume of the floor along with some sea water and measure the oxygen levels.This underwater region is called the abyssal zone. It receives too little sunlight for photosynthesis to be feasible. Instead, life-forms here get oxygen from water carried in by a global circulation called the ‘Great Conveyor Belt’. Still, the amount of oxygen is low and without any local production, the device should have measured the oxygen levels dropping as small animals consumed it. But the scientists found the opposite: it increased, sometimes tripling in just two days.They double-checked the finding by recreating the conditions on the ocean floor in their lab, and found the oxygen levels to increase up to a point before dropping.When they measured the physical characteristics of the nodules, they found their surfaces to have a voltage of up to 0.95 V. Splitting one water molecule requires 1.5 V, but the researchers have suspected the voltage could build up if many nodules are close together, like the cells of a battery.Andrew Sweetman, an ecologist with the Scottish Association for Marine Science in the U.K. and a coauthor of the study, told Nature, “We have another source of oxygen on the planet, other than photosynthesis.” His team is calling it ‘dark oxygen’.Oxygen sources are valuable because they allow life to survive. But as the lab experiment indicated, the nodules could only produce oxygen as long as they could muster a sufficient voltage. The nodules’ own energy source is also not clear.Given the quantity of metals polymetallic nodules on the ocean floor hold, deep-sea mining is expected to be a major marine resource extraction activity in the coming decades. The International Seabed Authority has established 15-year contracts with at least 22 contractors — including the Government of India — to look for polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides, and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the deep seabed. China alone is expected to mine 17% of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.The new finding raises the possibility of such mining damaging ecosystems that require ‘dark oxygen’ to survive. Experts have found deep-sea mining itself could be harmful to the marine environment, ‘dark oxygen’ or not.In 1989-1996, scientists from Germany conducted the Disturbance and Recolonisation (DISCOL) Experiment in the Peru Basin as the world’s “first large-scale impact assessment” to assess the “environmental impacts originating from the mining of polymetallic nodules”. They built a device that disturbed the sea floor like a deep-sea mining exercise might have and collected data about how the disturbances changed local oceanographic and sedimentological profiles, among other things.A 2019 study in the journal Scientific Reports reported that “the effects of simulated mining impacts induced during the DISCOL [Experiment] were still evident in the megabenthos of the Peru Basin after 26 years.”The same study also reported “significantly lower heterogeneity diversity in disturbed areas” and added that “if the results of this experiment … can be extrapolated to the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, the impacts of polymetallic nodule mining there may be greater than expected, and could potentially lead to an irreversible loss of some ecosystem functions”.In November 2023, Nature reported based on a paper published then that deep-sea mining “for minerals could harm deep-sea jellyfish, according to the first study of mining impacts on animals living in the water column.”Scientists also know less about ecosystems in the abyssal zone than they do about many of those aboveground, which means the models scientists use to predict their fate and their role in global climate processes could be unreliable. With these and other issues in mind, on July 20, three major European insurance companies said they would exclude deep-sea mining from their underwriting portfolios.‘Dark oxygen’ adds to these challenges. If deep-sea mining doesn’t find sustainable ways to respond to them, it may be rendered altogether infeasible. critical minerals  /  mining  /  minerals  /  The Hindu Explains  Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Wildfire Smoke Chokes Parts of Canada and Western US  With Some Areas Under Air Quality Alerts,"Wildfire smoke chokes parts of Canada and western US, with some areas under air quality alerts  Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.Authorities say a wildfire burning in Oregon that’s kicking smoke into neighboring Idaho and beyond is now the largest active blaze in the U.S.LOS ANGELES (AP) — Fires burning in California, Oregon, Arizona, Washington and other western states, as well as Canada, have filled the skies in regions of the western U.S. with smoke and haze, forcing some affected areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories. As of Wednesday morning, there were 79 large active wildfires across the country being managed that have burned 1,431,460 acres (579,292 hectares), according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Evacuation orders are in effect for 15 fires in the Northwest, where fires continue to show active to extreme behavior. Communities near several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin are also under evacuation orders. Oregon has 31 large active fires that have burned 791,653 acres (320,371 hectares). The Durkee Fire, the largest active blaze in the U.S., was burning near the Oregon-Idaho border and was 0% contained as of Wednesday morning and had burned nearly 400 square miles (1,036 square kilometers). The Cow Valley, Falls and Lone Rock fires, the next largest, have collectively seared some 404,404 acres (163,657 hectares). There are 12 active large wildfires in both California and Arizona. In the Golden State, the Lake Fire in Santa Barbara has scorched 38,664 acres (15,647 hectares) and was 90% contained; the 2024 SQF Lightning Complex in Tulare has burned 31,309 acres (12,670 hectares) and was 7% contained; and the Shelly Fire in Siskiyou County that’s charred 15,656 acres (6,336 hectares) was 62% contained. Hot, dry and windy conditions have increase fire activity in some areas, including the Hill Fire in northern California.The Black Fire east of Phoenix is the largest in Arizona, followed by the Romero Fire west of Dudleyville.  The Pioneer Fire in Washington is the largest in the state at 30,667 acres (12,410.5 hectares). In Montana, the Deadman Fire in Rosebud County grew to 19,982 acres (8,086 hectares) and was 95% contained. In Canada, there are about 430 active wildfires in British Columbia and 177 in neighboring Alberta, including two that led to the evacuation of up to 25,000 visitors and residents of Canadian Rockies’ largest national park.Fuels and fire behavior advisories were in effect for California, Nevada, Southeast and Central Oregon, Southern Idaho and the Utah and Arizona Strip. Unhealthy air pollution from wildfires have triggered air quality alerts and advisories in regions of the western U.S. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality issued air quality alerts for the eastern counties of Harney, Malheur, Grant, Baker and Morrow until further notice. Unhealthy air was reported in cities of Bend and La Pine today and forecaster for tomorrow, with smoke expected to continue degrading air quality in La Pine after Thursday. Smoke from the Durkee Fire was choking the air in Boise, Idaho and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.In Idaho, air quality advisories were sent out to the central counties of Ada, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington. In north central Washington, the Colville Reservation, all of Chelan County, plus the Methow Valley down to Brewster in Okanogan County were under air quality alerts until further notice.And in Canada, authorities issued an air quality advisory for Calgary, Alberta due to the wildfire smoke. The government agency called it high risk and said children and the elderly should avoid outdoor physical exertion.Wildfire smoke can cause unhealthy air quality in areas many miles away from fires. To stay safe, the South Coast Air Quality Management District recommends people start by learning about air quality conditions and forecasts in their area. Those with an air conditioning system should change filters often, with high-efficiency filters labeled “MERV13” or higher being the most effective at removing smoke particles. Portable HEPA air purifiers also help. To limit exposure to unhealthy air quality, people should stay indoors with windows and doors closed. Avoid heavy exertion outdoors, using fans or swamp coolers that take air from outside, all wood-burning appliances, and lighting candles and incense. If you need to be outside in smoky conditions, a respirator mask such as an N-95 or P-100 can offer some protection. Lastly, know your risks. Some people, such as children and those with heart or lung issues, can be more sensitive to moderate to unhealthy air quality. When cleaning ash after a wildfire, wear goggles and a snug a respirator mask such as an N-95 or P-100. Avoid skin contact with ash by wearing gloves, closed-toe shoes, socks and long pants and shirts. Wash ash from pets and outdoor belonging like cars and toys. Mist floors with water and gently sweep or mop, then collect ash in plastic bags and throw it out. Don’t use leaf blowers. Keep water with ash away from storm drains. And clean inside with a vacuum that has disposable filter bags.AP writer Rob Gillies contributed from Toronto.Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",True,True,True
UN Cultural Agency Rejects Plan to Place Britain's Stonehenge on List of Heritage Sites in Danger,"UN cultural agency rejects plan to place Britain's Stonehenge on list of heritage sites in danger      Print  The United Nations' cultural agency rejected recommendations Wednesday to place Stonehenge on the list of world heritage sites in danger over concerns that Britain's plans to build a nearby highway tunnel threaten the landscape around the prehistoric monument.Stonehenge was built on the flat lands of Salisbury Plain in southern England in stages, starting 5,000 years ago, with the unique stone circle erected in the late Neolithic period about 2,500 B.C.It was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1986 — an honor bestowed upon sites that have special cultural or physical significance.UNESCO experts had recommended listing Stonehenge as ""in danger"" over the plans for highway development.But at the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee, which maintains the list and oversees the conservation of the sites, members led by Kenya and Qatar said Britain's plans to mitigate the effect on the site were sufficient and that it should not be added to the ""in danger"" list.The highway project, which has been touted for decades and mired in legal challenges, is aimed at trying to ease traffic along a stretch of road prone to gridlock by moving the main highway underground and slightly farther away from the famous stone circle.It has faced fierce opposition from local residents and archaeologists, as well as concern from UNESCO, over potential damage to the environment, wildlife and possible new archaeological finds.Kenya, in amending the recommendation to list the site as in danger, focused on the fact that the main stone circle would be farther away from the road with the new construction, and not the experts' assessment that the road project would significantly impact the greater site. It also noted that Britain had considered more than 50 proposals for the highway plan.""What needs to be protected is not just the henge but the overall landscape of which the henge is a central focus,"" the UNESCO experts had argued in their draft proposal, which was rejected.""The main henge is a highly visible and well-known monument and the proposed tunnel would improve its immediate setting, but this monument has to be considered in its context, surrounded by and inextricably linked to a large number of prehistoric features, which together form an ancient landscape.""After rejecting the proposal to list Stonehenge as in danger, the committee agreed to ask Britain for an updated report on the state of conservation of the property by December 2025.UNESCO says a site's inclusion on its List of World Heritage Sites in Danger is not punitive, but rather meant to draw international attention to the urgent need for conservation measures and ""encourage corrective action.""If issues are not rectified, sites face the possibility of being de-listed by UNESCO, though that is rare.",True,True,True

All Rights Reserved.Eggs of a rare Siamese crocodile species hatch in Cardamom National Park in June, 2024. (Bros Pov/Fauna & Flora via AP)PNOMH PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Conservationists in Cambodia found 106 eggs of rare Siamese crocodile species in a western Cambodian wildlife sanctuary, officials said Thursday, calling it the biggest discovery in the last 20 years, giving new hope for the world’s rarest crocodile species’ survival in the wild.The group discovered the species eggs in Cardamom National Park in May. Between June 27 and 30, a total of 60 eggs were successfully hatched, according to a joint statement issued by the ministries of agriculture and environment along with the conservation group Fauna & Flora.“This discovery indicates that the area is a key habitat for wild crocodiles, providing hope for the species recovery,” the statement said. The area and the young reptiles have been under the protection of Cardamom National Park Wildlife Sanctuary rangers, it added.The crocodile species was once widespread across Southeast Asia but is now listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. It had all but disappeared by the 1990s due to a combination of poaching, habitat destruction and crossbreeding with other crocodile species.Cambodian environment minister, Eang Sophalleth, said his ministry is working on the conservation and habitat restoration of these critically endangered Siamese crocodiles.“The Siamese crocodiles play an important role in the ecosystem and the discovery of the five nets successfully hatching 60 eggs reflects that the Cardamom National Park is a safe and suitable habitat for this species,” Sophalleth said in Thursday’s statement.Eggs of a rare Siamese crocodile species hatch in Cardamom National Park in June, 2024. (Toy Ya/Fauna & Flora via AP) It’s believed only about 1,000 Siamese crocodiles remain in the wild, with more than 300 of them in Cambodia. In 2017, wildlife researchers found six eggs in Sre Ambel district in the southern province of Koh Kong as they were exploring for tracks and signs of the reptile. Later in September 2021, eight hatchlings were found by conservationists in a river in the Srepok wildlife sanctuary in eastern Cambodia which raised hopes for its survival in the wild.Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Brazilian Researchers Discover Dinosaur Fossil After Heavy Rains in Rio Grande Do Sul,"Brazilian researchers discover dinosaur fossil after heavy rains in Rio Grande do Sul  Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.Brazilian scientists have discovered a skeleton of what they claim is one of the world’s oldest dinosaurs. The remains surfaced after heavy rains in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul accelerated the terrain’s natural erosion. The fossil is believed to be around 233 million years old.RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A team of Brazilian scientists has discovered a fossilized skeleton of what they believe is one of the world’s oldest dinosaurs after heavy rains in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul accelerated the natural process of erosion.The fossil found next to a reservoir in the municipality of Sao Joao do Polesine is around 233 million years old, according to paleontologist Rodrigo Temp Müller, who led the team from the Federal University of Santa Maria that found the bones in May.The claims have not been verified by other scientists or published in a scientific journal. The researcher believes the dinosaur lived during the Triassic period, when all continents were part of a single land mass called Pangaea. Dinosaurs are thought to have first evolved at that time. The apex predator discovered in Rio Grande do Sul belongs to the group known as Herrerasauridae — a family of dinosaurs that used to wander across lands that now make up present-day Brazil and Argentina, according to a fact sheet about the discovery shared with The Associated Press.The size of the bones reveals that the dinosaur would have reached around 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) in length, according to the document.Rodrigo Temp Müller said that he and his team were “very excited and surprised” by their findings.After around four days of excavations, the group of researchers transported a block of rock containing the specimen back to the laboratory, where they ran tests. “Initially it seemed like just a few isolated bones, but as we exposed the material, we were able to see that we had an almost complete skeleton,” Müller said. The expert hypothesizes that their discovery is the second most complete skeleton for this type of dinosaur. Researchers will now try to determine whether the fossil belongs to an already-known species or a new kind. That work is expected to take several months, as the process is meticulous to ensure no damaged is caused.Fossils are more likely to appear after rains, as water exposes the materials by removing the sediment that covers them, in a phenomenon known as weathering. Rio Grande do Sul saw record amounts of rainfall earlier this year. That caused devastating floods in May that killed at least 182 people, according to a toll published by the state’s civil defense on July 8.Extreme weather events are made more likely by climate change, principally caused by the burning of oil, gas and coal.Müller said that more fossils are appearing because of the heavy rains, which has launched a race against time to rescue the materials before they are ruined.In the field, his team observed “a leg bone and a pelvis bone in the pelvic region that were already being destroyed due to the rain,” he said.Müller hopes the discovery will contribute to elucidate the origins of dinosaurs.“Having new fossils that are so well preserved certainly helps us better understand this topic that is still much debated,” he said.Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Scientists Have Confirmed a Cave on the Moon That Could Be Used to Shelter Future Explorers,"Scientists have confirmed a cave on the moon that could be used to shelter future explorers   To enjoy additional benefitsCONNECT WITH USUpdated  - July 15, 2024 09:10 pm IST Published - July 15, 2024 08:52 pm IST - Cape Canaveral Scientists have confirmed a cave on the moon, not far from where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed 55 years ago this week, and suspect there are hundreds more that could house future astronauts.   Photo Credit: AP Scientists have confirmed a cave on the moon, not far from where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed 55 years ago, and suspect there are hundreds more that could house future astronauts.An Italian-led team reported Monday that there’s evidence for a sizable cave accessible from the deepest known pit on the moon. It’s located at the Sea of Tranquility, just 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Apollo 11’s landing site.The pit, like the more than 200 others discovered up there, was created by the collapse of a lava tube.Researchers analyzed radar measurements by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and compared the results with lava tubes on Earth. Their findings appeared in the journal Nature Astronomy.The radar data reveals only the initial part of the underground cavity, according to the scientists. They estimate it’s at least 130 feet (40 meters) wide and tens of yards (meters) long, probably more. Also Read: The third human landing on the moon“Lunar caves have remained a mystery for over 50 years. So it was exciting to be able to finally prove the existence” of one, Leonardo Carrer and Lorenzo Bruzzone of the University of Trento, wrote in an email.Most of the pits seem to be located in the moon’s ancient lava plains, according to the scientists. There also could be some at the moon’s south pole, the planned location of NASA’s astronaut landings later this decade. Permanently shadowed craters there are believed to hold frozen water that could provide drinking water and rocket fuel.During NASA’s Apollo program, 12 astronauts landed on the moon, beginning with Armstrong and Aldrin on July 20, 1969.The findings suggest there could be hundreds of pits on the moon and thousands of lava tubes. Such places could serve as a natural shelter for astronauts, protecting them from cosmic rays and solar radiation as well as from micrometeorite strikes. Building habitats from scratch would be more time-consuming and challenging, even when factoring in the potential need of reinforcing the cave walls to prevent a collapse, the team said.Rocks and other material inside these caves — unaltered by the harsh surface conditions over the eons — also can help scientists better understand how the moon evolved, especially involving its volcanic activity. space programme  /  space programme BACK TO TOPTerms & conditions     Institutional SubscriberComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

To Save Spotted Owls  US Officials Plan to Kill Hundreds of Thousands of Another Owl Species,"To save spotted owls, US officials plan to kill hundreds of thousands of another owl species   To save the imperiled spotted owl from potential extinction, U.S. wildlife officials are embracing a contentious plan to deploy trained shooters into dense West Coast forests to kill almost a half-million barred owls that are crowding out their cousins.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service strategy released Wednesday is meant to prop up declining spotted owl populations in Oregon, Washington state and California. The Associated Press obtained details in advance.  Documents released by the agency show up to about 450,000 barred owls would be shot over three decades after the birds from the eastern U.S. encroached into the West Coast territory of two owls: northern spotted owls and California spotted owls. The smaller spotted owls have been unable to compete with the invaders, which have large broods and need less room to survive than spotted owls.  Past efforts to save spotted owls focused on protecting the forests where they live, sparking bitter fights over logging but also helping slow the birds' decline. The proliferation of barred owls in recent years is undermining that earlier work, officials said.  “Without actively managing barred owls, northern spotted owls will likely go extinct in all or the majority of their range, despite decades of collaborative conservation efforts,"" said Fish and Wildlife Service Oregon state supervisor Kessina Lee.  The notion of killing one bird species to save another has divided wildlife advocates and conservationists. It's reminiscent of past government efforts to save West Coast salmon by killing sea lions and cormorants that prey on the fish, and to preserve warblers by killing cowbirds that lay eggs in warbler nests.  Some advocates grudgingly accepted the barred owl removal strategy; others said it's reckless diversion from needed forest preservation.  “The Fish and Wildlife Service is turning from protector of wildlife to persecutor of wildlife,” said Wayne Pacelle, founder of the advocacy group Animal Wellness Action. He predicted the program would fail because the agency won't be able to keep more barred owls from migrating into areas where others have been killed.  The shootings would likely begin next spring, officials said. Barred owls would be lured using megaphones to broadcast recorded owl calls, then shot with shotguns. Carcasses would be buried on site.  The birds already are being killed by researchers in some spotted owl habitats, with about 4,500 removed since 2009, said Robin Bown, barred owl strategy leader for the Fish and Wildlife Service. Those targeted included barred owls in California’s Sierra Nevada region, where the animals have only recently arrived and officials want to stop populations from taking hold.  In other areas where barred owls are more established, officials aim to reduce their numbers but acknowledge shooting owls is unlikely to eliminate them entirely.  Supporters include the American Bird Conservancy and other conservation groups.  Barred owls don’t belong in the West, said American Bird Conservancy Vice President Steve Holmer. Killing them is unfortunate, he added, but reducing their numbers could allow them to live alongside spotted owls over the long term.  “As the old forests are allowed to regrow, hopefully coexistence is possible and maybe we don’t need to do as much” shooting, Holmer said.  The killings would reduce nationwide barred owl numbers by less than 1%, officials said. That compares with potential extinction for spotted owls should the problem go unaddressed.  Public hunting of barred owls wouldn't be allowed. The wildlife service would designate government agencies, landowners, American Indian tribes or companies to carry out the killings. Shooters would have to provide documentation of training or experience in owl identification and firearm skills.  The publishing in the coming days of a final environmental study on the proposal will open a 30-day comment period before a final decision is made.  The barred owl plan follows decades of conflict between conservationists and timber companies, which cut down vast areas of older forests where spotted owls reside.  Early efforts to save the birds culminated in logging bans in the 1990s that roiled the timber industry and its political supporters in Congress.  Yet spotted owl populations continued declining after barred owls started showing up on the West Coast several decades ago. Across study sites in the region, at least half of spotted owls have been lost, with losses topping 75% in some areas, said Katherine Fitzgerald, who leads the wildlife service's northern spotted owl recovery program.  Opponents say the mass killing of barred owls would cause severe disruption to forest ecosystems and could lead to other species — including spotted owls — being mistakenly shot. They’ve also challenged the notion that barred owls don’t belong on the West Coast, characterizing their expanding range as a natural ecological phenomenon.  Researchers say barred owls moved westward by one of two routes: across the Great Plains, where trees planted by settlers gave them a foothold in new areas; or via Canada’s boreal forests, which have become more hospitable as temperatures rise because of climate change.  Northern spotted owls are federally protected as a threatened species. Federal officials determined in 2020 that their continued decline merited an upgrade to the more critical designation of “endangered.” But the Fish and Wildlife Service refused to do so at the time, saying other species took priority.  California spotted owls were proposed for federal protections last year. A decision is pending.  Under former President Donald Trump, government officials stripped habitat protections for spotted owls at the behest of the timber industry. Those were reinstated under President Joe Biden after the Interior Department said political appointees under Trump relied on faulty science to justify their weakening of protections.

A new algae-based menstrual pad could stop leaks,"A new algae-based menstrual pad could stop leaks  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	The prototype turns period blood into a gelMenstrual blood can be unpredictable, and it can often easily leak through commercially available products.Johner Images/Getty ImagesBy Claire YuanJuly 26, 2024 at 11:00 amMenstruation can be messy and uncomfortable, often due to leaky pads, tampons and cups. A new alginate-based powder may solve that problem. The material, which solidifies menstrual blood by turning it into a gel mixture, could reduce leakage in period products without compromising capacity, researchers report July 10 in Matter.“Our paper is a proof of concept,” says Rogério Aparecido Bataglioli, a chemical engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. Before being used commercially, he says, the materials would need to be assessed for safety and scalability.Most menstrual pads use cellulose-based materials to absorb period blood. Though they are effective, many people who menstruate still struggle with leakage and mess.To solve this problem, the team turned to alginate, a naturally occurring substance derived from algae and seaweed. After the researchers screened a large pool of potential polysaccharides — long chains of carbohydrate molecules — that could have blood-absorbing properties, alginate excelled at absorbing and gelling blood. It also has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in pharmaceuticals, food and medical materials.To further improve the alginate’s absorption, the researchers added glycerol. They then tested the absorbency of these alginate-glycerol powders against commercial absorbents by sandwiching each between sheets of gauze. The team dripped modified pig blood through a model vagina to mimic menstruation before performing a squeeze test on the blood-soaked materials. Though both were good at absorbing the blood, when the simulated period pads with commercial absorbent were compressed, it was “like squeezing a sponge,” says Bryan Hsu, a microbiologist at Virginia Tech. With the alginate material, which gelled the blood, the pads leaked less under pressure.To assess the leakage of alginate-based menstrual pads, researchers wrapped the new material in gauze and dripped pig blood on it. They then lightly centrifuged the pads on top of well plates to mimic compression and collect the leakage. They did the same thing for three other scenarios: no added material, commercial pad fillers and polyacrylate, the industry gold-standard superabsorbent polymer. Click through the slideshow below to see how each fared.The team also tested their new material in menstrual cups. They packed the alginate-glycerol powder into a long and narrow cotton sheath that was then coiled around inside of the cup. After the blood entered the menstrual cup and encountered the alginate, it gelled. Then, the blood could be removed along with the cotton tube — and a new one could be reinserted — with minimal liquid mess. In solidifying the menstrual blood into a gel, Hsu says, the goal is to make menstrual cup removal and cleaning easier and tidier.One limitation of the study, notes ob–gyn Abigail Liberty, is that the blood was defibrinated pig blood, which does not contain fibrin, a protein involved in clotting. Though she applauds the team for using blood instead of another model fluid, menstrual blood is “different than blood that’s just floating around the body,” says Liberty, of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland (SN: 4/16/24). “It’s secreted in a different way. It’s grown, it’s released in a different way.”Due to a shortage of research on menstrual care and period products, Bataglioli and colleagues did not have a base of experimental techniques to draw from and adapt. Instead, they designed many of their methods from scratch. “That’s a message to the scientific community — there’s nothing out there,” says Zeinab Hosseinidoust, a biomedical engineer at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. “Even more important than the actual research that was done is the message that this work sends.”Questions or comments on this article?

Sara Moser/Washington UniversityBy Laura SandersJuly 17, 2024 at 11:00 amInside your skull, your brain hums along with its own unique pattern of activity, a neural fingerprint that’s yours and yours alone. A heavy dose of psilocybin temporarily wipes the prints clean.The psychedelic drug psilocybin dramatically changes how collections of nerve cells work in the brain, eliminating normal communication between brain regions, a new brain scanning study published July 17 in Nature shows. These brain images, taken before, during and after a high dose of psilocybin, expand the understanding of the drug’s effects, which is being studied for its promise in treating mental health disorders such as depression.The brain scanning protocol researchers used was intense. “We had a small number of people, just seven participants in the whole study, but an enormous amount of data on each one,” says Joshua Siegel, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Each person underwent about 18 functional MRI brain scans, one roughly every other day, over the course of the study.That repeated scanning gives “an unprecedented view on how brain connectivity evolves after a dose of psilocybin,” says Alex Kwan, a neuroscientist at Cornell University who wasn’t involved in the study.In the first part of the experiment, Siegel and colleagues recorded each person’s baseline brain activity, the unique patterns that emerge much like a fingerprint’s whorls, loops and arches when a person simply rests.Later in the study, researchers gave participants 25 milligrams of psilocybin, a key ingredient in some hallucinogenic mushrooms, and watched what happened in the scanner. On a different day, for comparison, each participant also got a dose of methylphenidate, the generic form of Ritalin, a stimulant that affects the brain.The effects of psilocybin were obvious, and big. “Psilocybin had humongous acute effects on the human brain,” says Nico Dosenbach, a neuroscientist also at Washington University School of Medicine. “Way, way, way bigger than the active control,” the methylphenidate.Some of the biggest changes were in a brain system known as the default mode network, or DMN. This coordinated group of brain regions is active when nothing particular is happening. Scientists think that the DMN has a role in creating our sense of self (SN: 7/3/09). “It’s multiple parts of the brain across both hemispheres, but they’re all activating and deactivating in a very organized, synchronous way,” Siegel says. “And with psilocybin, it essentially becomes chaos.”Dosenbach can attest that the drug causes a loss of sense of self. Along with being a researcher on the study, he was one of the seven study participants, giving him an unusual perspective on psilocybin’s effects on the brain. “You read about it, and you think about it and then you experience it, and you’re like, ‘Wow, that’s even more real.’”Signs of those experiences showed up in the MRI scans. The team saw that psilocybin seemed to wipe clean the participants’ neural fingerprints. Dosenbach has an analogy to explain the brain changes in the scans: “You’d be like, ‘That is my face, and that is your face.’ And then you took a medicine, and we both had a puppy face — very similar, but very different from our normal faces.”A day after taking the drug, most of psilocybin’s brain changes were gone, Siegel says. But one change persisted for three weeks. There was diminished coordination between the DMN and a part of the hippocampus, a structure involved in memory. Researchers don’t yet know how long this change might last, how it affects the brain overall or if it could hint at psilocybin’s therapeutic effects. It was not present in data from four of the participants who came in for scans six to 12 months later, but the study didn’t have enough data to say with certainty that it was gone.The findings add to earlier work that sought to understand how psychedelic drugs change brains and show that the effects are far from simple. “Psilocybin is not simply tuning brain activity up or down,” Kwan says. “The results paint a more complex and nuanced picture for how psychedelics change neural activity dynamics than previously thought.”Recent studies point to the promise of psychedelic drugs as therapies for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and more (SN: 12/3/21). Understanding how these drugs affect the brain in the hours, days and months after taking it may lead to better treatments for some of these disorders.Questions or comments on this article?

Honeybees can “smell” lung cancer,"Michigan researches say honey bees can detect lung cancer  Watch CBS News     By                                        Kelly Vaughen  June 13, 2024 / 12:06 AM EDT           / CBS Detroit         (CBS DETROIT) - Researchers at Michigan State University have found that honey bees could detect lung cancer.Bees have long provided humans with honey, wax, and the pollination of around 80% of our flowering plants, but they could also sniff out cancer in the future.Dogs have been used as a medical diagnostic tool, as they can sense seizures, among other things. However, MSU researchers said bees also have an incredible sense of smell, are cheaper, and require less training and upkeep than dogs.The process starts with brain surgery on the live bees, done under a microscope.""You definitely notice how much your hands shake,"" said Michael Parnas, a Ph.D candidate at Michigan State University.He said they used a 3D-printed harness to hold the live bee as they opened its head to the part of its brain dealing with smell.""And we can plant an electrode in there to basically record how those are responding as we present odors to the insect.Parnas said they then presented the bees with a mixture replicating the breath of someone with lung cancer, using lab-grown human cancer cells. They found bees could detect biomarkers or chemical concentrations associated with cancer.The insects were not only able to distinguish between cancer and healthy breath but could also differentiate between the six different types of lung cancer cells they smelled. They could also detect very small concentrations of cancer.""Think like one molecule in a swimming pool sort of concentrations,"" Parnas said. ""It doesn't surprise me at all,"" said Brian Peterson-Roest, the co-founder and president of Bees in the D.  Bees in the D is a nonprofit that provides education and conservation for pollinators. Peterson-Roest said bees have an incredible sense of smell. ""It's kind of funny, I tell people. With my truck, there's all kinds of bee smells because I take honey frames and stuff like that. Literally within a minute if not 30 seconds, bees start showing up. Because they can smell those different odorants that are in the back of my truck,"" he said.He said bees are crucial for our food industry and ecosystem and could soon be for our healthcare. MSU researchers said the science on cancer detection is early, but they hope that based on their findings, people could soon get a noninvasive early-detection cancer test.Kelly Vaughen is a reporter and weekend evening anchor for CBS News Detroit.

A malaria drug could be used to treat PCOS  a common hormone disorder,"A malaria drug could be used to treat PCOS, a common hormone disorder  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Artemisinin reduced ovarian cysts and restored normal menstruation in people with PCOSIn polycystic ovarian syndrome, cysts form from follicles holding unreleased eggs (right ovary in this illustration compared with a healthy ovary, left). PCOS affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, but effective treatments remain elusive.Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library/Getty ImagesBy Darren IncorvaiaJune 13, 2024 at 2:00 pmUpdated June 13, 2024 at 3:45 pmA common antimalarial drug could also be used to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome, an endocrine disorder that affects hundreds of millions of people of reproductive age worldwide.After receiving repeated doses of artemisinin, a small group of women with PCOS had lower blood testosterone levels and healthier-looking ovaries, researchers report in the June 14 Science. The results suggest artemisinin compounds, which are already known to be effective against malaria, lupus and cancer, could also be used to alleviate symptoms of PCOS.The discovery could “potentially change the landscape of PCOS treatment,” Elisabet Stener-Victorin, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm who was not involved in the research, writes in a perspective in the same issue of Science. “Although further studies will be needed … the discovery of artemisinins as effective remedies for PCOS nonetheless represents a promising new approach.”Despite the prevalence of PCOS, what causes the disorder is not known. Doctors diagnose it based on elevated levels of hormones called androgens, which includes testosterone, and a plethora of small cysts on patients’ ovaries. Treatments tend to target specific symptoms, such as acne, excess hair growth, irregular menstruation or infertility. People with PCOS are also at higher risk of metabolic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, and researchers now think that underlying changes to the systems controlling our metabolism, like the one involving insulin, are to blame for both.In 2016, Qi-Qun Tang, a molecular biologist and medical researcher at Fudan University in Shanghai, was studying adipocytes, better known as fat cells, and metabolic diseases. Screening 3,000 drugs, Tang and colleagues identified the Nobel Prize–winning drug artemisinin as a promising candidate to turn white adipose tissue into brown or beige adipose tissue, which is easier to lose, to treat symptoms of obesity (SN: 10/5/15). Coincidentally, around the same time, another group found that brown adipose tissue could be used to treat PCOS in rats.“We became interested in investigating the potential impact of artemisinins on PCOS,” Tang says.The team first tested the idea in rodents, injecting female mice with an androgen called dehydroepiandrosterone to induce PCOS symptoms. If mice were also simultaneously given artemisinin along with the hormone, PCOS-like symptoms such as an interrupted fertility cycle, elevated testosterone in the blood and ovarian cysts never developed. After seeing similar results in rats, the team tested the drug in a small clinical study of people with PCOS.Nineteen patients took dihydroartemisinin, the form of artemisinin used to treat malaria, three times a day for three months. After this treatment regimen, 12 of the patients began having regular menstrual cycles, and most of the patients had lower blood testosterone levels and fewer developing follicles in their ovaries. Follicles contain egg cells that are released during ovulation in order to be fertilized. Having an overabundance of them is a sign of PCOS; a follicle that does not release an egg can develop into a cyst.Biochemical tests showed artemisinin helps degrade a testosterone-making protein called CYP11A1, which contains heme, resulting in less testosterone in the blood to interfere with the ovaries’ normal activity. Heme contains iron, which can react with artemisinin to produce toxic forms of oxygen that can go on to kill malarial parasites or cancer cells, says Yang Liu, a biologist also at Fudan University. These cellular interactions with heme are most likely how artemisinin works against so many different ailments.We still need to understand where else in the body artemisinin is acting, says Sireesha Reddy, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso, who cautions that the results are very preliminary and need to be replicated by other researchers. She suggests investigating how the drug affects cardiometabolic symptoms of PCOS by measuring levels of insulin and lipids in the blood, and how it works in patients with more severe PCOS, like those with higher weights and BMIs than the individuals in this study.The team next plans to test different forms and dosages of artemisinin to find what works best against PCOS before potentially moving on to larger clinical trials. Tang says he is also keen to see if artemisinin can restore one of PCOS’s most serious symptoms — patients’ loss of fertility. “We have a long way to go to see how they can get fertility back.”Questions or comments on this article?

Gen X has higher cancer rates than their baby boomer parents,"Gen X has higher cancer rates than their baby boomer parents  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Experts call for policies to promote healthier lifestyles in light of a concerning uptickCancer is on the rise in the United States in Generation X (people born between 1965 and 1980) compared with their parents’ generations, a new study shows. That could be bad news for younger generations, like the boy in this multigenerational family.Oliver Rossi/Stone/Getty Images PlusBy Tina Hesman SaeyJune 10, 2024 at 11:00 amGeneration X is outdoing baby boomers, but not in a good way.Per capita, Gen X (born from 1965 through 1980) is getting cancer more often than their parents’ and grandparents’ generations, researchers report June 10 in JAMA Network Open. The forecast doesn’t look good for Gen Xers, who are starting to reach ages when cancers most often appear, say Philip Rosenberg, a biostatistician at U.S. National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Md. If the trend continues, millennials (born from 1981 to 1996) and younger generations might also experience more cancer, Rosenberg and his NCI colleague Adalberto Miranda-Filho warn.Rosenberg, who describes himself as a boomer, wanted to see whether his generation (born from 1946 through 1964) was better off than his parents’ Greatest (1908–1927) and Silent (1928–1945) generations. And whether his millennial (1981–1996) and Gen Z (1997–2012) children might be better off still. “You hope to see things get better when it comes to health metrics, life expectancy [and] cancer rates,” he says. “You hope to see all that improve.”Rosenberg and Miranda-Filho gathered data from 3.8 million people diagnosed with invasive cancer. The researchers compared generational differences in diagnoses of cancer at multiple sites in the body, and projected Gen X’s rate at age 60. Gen X is of an age to develop cancers, so the researchers could detect trends for them. Since millennials are not yet old enough to get many cancers, the team couldn’t make estimates for that generation.The forecast was not what Rosenberg had hoped. Compared with baby boomers, Gen X women had projected increases in thyroid, kidney, rectal, uterine, colon, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukemia. Gen X men have forecasted rises in thyroid, kidney, rectal, colon and prostate cancers. The study looks at how often people are newly diagnosed with cancer, not at whether they die of it.There were some bright spots too. Gen X women had decreases in lung and cervical cancers compared with baby boomers, while Gen X men had less lung, liver and gallbladder cancers and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.But when combining all the cancers, the picture was bleak because the “gaining cancers numerically overtook falling cancers,” the researchers found.  Generation X is being diagnosed with more cancer than earlier generations in the United States. Researchers lumped 20 leading cancers for women (yellow lines) and 18 for men (blue lines) to forecast trends in overall cancer rates at age 60. (Since the oldest Gen Xers are just approaching 60, shaded areas indicate possible ranges where the incidence rate could land, although the solid line is the most likely projection.) The graphs chart cancer diagnoses per person-year (p-y), that is, how often you would expect a cancer diagnosis if you watched 100,000 people for a year.Among men, cancer diagnoses declined in the Greatest and Silent Generations but then ticked up again in Boomers and continue to rise in Gen X. Asian and Pacific Islander men are the exception. Their cancer rates continued to decline into Gen X. Women tended to get fewer cancers than men in early generations, but the differences have largely been erased, except in the non-Hispanic Black population where men still get cancer more often. Scroll through to see how cancer incidence has changed through the generations for four racial or ethnic groups.Hispanic women had one of the biggest increases, a rise of 35 percent. They went from 598 cancers diagnosed per 100,000 person-years in the Silent and boomer generations (born from 1936 through 1960) to 806 diagnoses per 100,000 person-years in Gen X.  That rate is the number of new cancer diagnoses you would expect if you watched 100,000 people for a year. All racial and ethnic groups included in the study experienced increases in cancer diagnoses except for Asian and Pacific Islander men, for whom cancer rates fell from 562 cancers diagnosed per 100,000 person-years at age 60 in the Silent and boomer generation to 519 cancers per 100,000 person-years for Gen Xers, a decrease of 7.7 percent. Non-Hispanic Black men in Gen X had the highest combined rate of cancer at 1,561 cases per 100,000 person-years. That’s up about 12 percent from the 1,399 cancer diagnoses per 100,000 person-years in the boomer and Silent generations.Increases in many cancers, including colorectal cancers in people under 50, and upticks in kidney and thyroid cancers have previously been noted, says cancer epidemiologist Ahmedin Jemal of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta (SN: 8/14/23). And the jump is not limited to the United States. Other high-income countries have reported similar increases.The uptick of cancer in Gen X “is like a yellow flag,” Rosenberg says. “These numbers suggest there are some unfavorable trajectories.” He hopes other researchers will use the data to uncover what is driving those increases and find ways to turn the trends around.Researchers are only beginning to gather data on Gen X and cancer as people in that generation reach middle age, says Corinne Joshu, a cancer epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.Some of the increase may be due to better screening and early detection, Joshu says. “Sometimes that’s hard to say how much of this is related to changes in detection and changes in just clinical awareness to look for something, versus a true increase.” Some prostate cancers can be nasty, but many will be so slow growing that they don’t cause health problems, so there are concerns about overdiagnosing such cancers, she says.Many of the cancers on the rise among Gen Xers are linked to obesity, lack of exercise, eating too much red meat and other lifestyle factors. But changing that is not easy, Joshu says. “The healthy choices are not the easy choices to make in our society.”She and Jemal say that drops in lung cancer came about because of multilayered policy changes that banned smoking indoors and taxes that made cigarettes too expensive for people most likely to start smoking as teenagers. Vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) and other public health measures have been instrumental in reducing cervical cancer (SN: 4/28/17).But taking something away that isn’t good for health may be easier than making positive lifestyle changes accessible and affordable for everyone, Joshu says. “We do not see it easier and more affordable to eat healthier,” she says. “I think we could move the needle on that, but it takes societal effort and for people to come together and say, ‘This is important and it’s worth changing.’ … And that presumably would lead to not only a decrease in cancer, but a decrease in [other] major causes of death.”Questions or comments on this article?

Young people’s use of diabetes and weight loss drugs is up 600 percent ,"Prescriptions for weight loss, diabetes drugs for young people leaped 600% since 2020, study says                    The number of young people in the US who are prescribed GLP-1 agonist drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic for weight loss and diabetes soared 594.4% in just three years, according to new research.                  Demand for these drugs has skyrocketed for people of all ages recently, but the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal JAMA, found that between 2020 and 2023, the number of prescriptions written for people ages 12 to 25 increased from 8,722 to 60,567.                  Young women and adolescent girls had the biggest increase in the number of prescriptions.                  The study looked information from a database that reports prescriptions from more than 93% of retail pharmacies in the United States, although the data cannot capture what exactly the prescriptions were intended to treat and whether the patient actually used the medications.      Related article Many people using GLP-1s for weight loss stop treatment too soon, research shows, and results are not one-size-fits-all              For context, the study authors also looked at prescription trends for other medications and found that there was a 3% decrease in the prescription of other drugs for this age category during this same time period.                  The study looked at Ozempic (which uses the active ingredient semaglutide), Trulicity (dulaglutide) and Byetta (exenatide), which are approved to treat type 2 diabetes and can help with weight loss, and Saxenda (liraglutide) and Wegovy (semaglutide), which are approved for weight management. Each can be prescribed for children as young as 10 or 12. Tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, is approved only for adults.                  The authors from the University of Michigan Medical School and Yale University said that, given how many young people are being prescribed these medications, efforts to promote safe and appropriate prescribing should include endocrinologists, doctors who practice family medicine and nurse practitioners.                  Obesity and type 2 diabetes are affecting an increasing number of young people. The number of people ages 10 to 19 with type 2 diabetes doubled just over the past two decades in the US, a 2023 study found. The study predicted that by 2060, the number of young people with type 2 diabetes will increase 673%.      Related article Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among children and teens, new research shows              Obesity is also a significant problem for young people in the US, where the average young adult is now overweight, according to a 2023 study. About 1 in 6 adolescents is overweight, and almost 1 in 5 has obesity, studies show. Obesity alone affects 14.4 million children and teens in the US.                  Having obesity as a young person significantly increases a person’s chance of weight problems when they are older, research shows. Obesity and overweight can also be a significant risk factor for other health conditions like heart disease, kidney problems and even cancer, studies show, in additional to mental health conditions.      Dr. Melanie Cree, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado who has been working with this class of medication in clinical trials with children for almost a decade, says the drugs have been a game-changer not just to help kids lose weight and lower blood sugar, but also to  lower liver fat and improve cardiac and kidney function – “all of those conditions that go with type 2 diabetes.”                  “So it’s not only that they’re lowering blood sugars. It’s that they appear to be decreasing the complications that we see from type 2 diabetes, so that they’re really affecting multiple aspects,” said Cree, who was not involved with the new study. “They’re really changing the face of what diabetes looks like in an individual and in the field of diabetes across the board.”                  The American Academy of Pediatrics updated its guidelines for managing obesity last year and said that, in addition to behavior and lifestyle treatments for the whole family, the use of weight loss medications is appropriate for children 12 and over.                  Cree said she sees few downsides to these drugs. Some of her patients have had to stop taking them or can’t take as much because of side effects like nausea, and she’d like to see more research on that topic.                  When her patients can get access, Cree said, the positive changes have been significant. Many have experienced “profound” weight loss, she said, transforming their lives.                  The most significant downsides have nothing to do with the physical impact of the medications; rather, it’s that the medicine can be expensive and many of her patients can’t get insurance to cover the cost, particularly if they’re used for weight loss. Additionally, many patients have had a hard time filling prescriptions because of drug shortages.                  One parent of a child who lost a significant amount of weight told Cree that the medicine gave her her daughter back.                  “I had another girl who, after some weight loss, went to prom last fall, and it was the first dance she had ever gone to, because it was the first time she felt comfortable wearing a dress,” Cree said. “So really, really poignant stories from these adolescents. I just feel privileged to be a part of their life and be able to share in these transformations and moments with them.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

One circuit underlies the positive feelings this powerful drug elicits, while the other was responsible for the intense withdrawal when it is taken away. Opioid addiction leads to tens of thousands of deaths each year, and the team hopes that this work will help in the development of drugs that are less addictive.Research Article: Chaudun et al.How an ‘assembloid’ could transform how scientists study drug delivery to the brain, and an edible gel that prevents and treats alcohol intoxication in mice.Research Highlight: Organoids merge to model the blood–brain barrierResearch Highlight: How cheesemaking could cook up an antidote for alcohol excessWhy babies are taking the South Korean government to court, and Europe’s efforts to send a nuclear-powered heater to Mars.Nature News: Why babies in South Korea are suing the governmentNature News: Mars rover mission will use pioneering nuclear power sourceSubscribe to Nature Briefing, an unmissable daily round-up of science news, opinion and analysis free in your inbox every weekday.Never miss an episode.

I’m Lizzie Gibney.Nick Petrić HoweAnd I'm Nick Petrić Howe.Nick Petrić HoweOpioids, like fentanyl, are behind tens of thousands of deaths every year in the US alone, and that is in large part down to their very addictive nature. The drugs have two main effects on the brain that contribute to this: one, they make you feel good — they reward you for taking them, and two, if you stop taking them you feel bad — you get withdrawal.And whilst these two effects are known to drive addiction, the underlying neuronal mechanism is unclear. And that’s a problem, because whilst these drugs have great potential to do harm, they are also incredibly useful for pain relief. A better understanding of what’s going on in the brain could allow scientists to design drugs that are less addictive, whilst still keeping their benefits.And that is precisely what Christian Lüscher from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, and his collaborators, have done - in mice - using the particularly potent drug, fentanyl. Here’s Christian.Christian LüscherSo far, when you look in the textbook, the explanation that is usually given is that opioids very strongly activates the dopamine system. And when they do so for some time, weeks, or even months, and then all of a sudden, they're not available, that system is sort of exhausted. And then you have a situation where you have not enough dopamine. And that would explain why people have this aversive state and they feel down. Now our work looked into this and we needed to do this in mice, because only there we can actually do all these molecular manipulations. And the first observation we made, which was very surprising is when you take out the protein, the receptor that is responsible for that positive reinforcement, in the reward system, the withdrawal is still normal. So there is there's still dependence and when the animal no longer has access to an opioid, they will show all the signs of withdrawal syndrome. So the– the explanation that it is the same system that causes the positive reinforcement, as well as the negative reinforcement didn't seem to hold. And so that was the beginning of our study.Nick Petrić HoweSo rather than there just being this one system that does both these things, there seem to be two different systems that do this sort of like withdrawal part and this reward pathway. How did you identify what was going on in these two different pathways?Christian LüscherSo we put the mice in situation where they will go into withdrawal. And we looked in many, many different brain regions, which ones were active. You can do this by monitoring a gene a so called immediate early gene that reflects the neuronal activity. And we had then a few candidate areas where something really interesting is going on during withdrawal, one of which was the central amygdala. And that's why we focused our attention then on this particular part of the brain.Nick Petrić HoweAnd what is the central amygdala normally involved in?Christian LüscherSo it's involved in fear responses, in anxiety. And so it's, of course, the brain regions that people know very well. What we have been able to contribute with this, that we identified the population of cells that express the receptor for the opiates, it's called the µ-opioid receptor. And that was unknown until then how exactly these cells are located in the central amygdala. And that is how we were able to identify that it is actually those cells, which are the entry gate if you will, of this negative reinforcement for opiates.Nick Petrić HoweAnd this is in contrast to the other one that's doing the more sort of positive reward side.Christian LüscherSure. So, then we now change from a model where one system would be responsible for both the positive and the negative reinforcement to a system where you would have two distinct circuits that mediate one and the other.Nick Petrić HoweAnd not only the identify these neurons and their relative locations in the brain, but you also manipulated them to show that there was a very causal mechanism going on here.Christian LüscherThat's the beauty of current modern circuit neuroscience. You cannot observe what happens in the cells but then you have actually tools to manipulate and these are largely optogenetic tools. That is, you can manipulate those cells by putting in ion channels that are light sensitive and you can either activate or inhibit the cells. And so, I guess the crucial experiment that really indicates causality was when we were able to put an opsin into these cells of the central amygdala, that activates those cells, and we made them active continuously. And we showed that this is very similar to the aversive state that the animal feels in opiate withdrawal. And so the animal then was given the opportunity to press a lever to pause this activation, and that they learned very quickly. So, this is precisely the definition of negative reinforcement, you do an action to alleviate an aversive state. And what's more, this mechanism is then also sensitive to the injection of fentanyl. So, we could block this behaviour by exposing the animal a little bit to fentanyl.Nick Petrić HoweSo, what do you think this means for our sort of understanding of opioids and addiction, that there are these two pathways?Christian LüscherSo for first, it's a gain in knowledge we better understand and now we can focus on the cellular mechanism and the molecular mechanisms. So it is conceivable that we then design drugs that would activate one or not the other. So, this is in the larger picture of trying to parse the relevant circuits that mediate specific symptoms of opiates. So for cor– for the opiates, the– the effect that we usually look for is to use them as painkillers. So, to reduce the pain that's yet in a different brain area but it is now important to see that we have additional two mechanisms that are involved and not one. And that will sort of give us new ideas on how to do selective new compounds that would basically do pain, to reduce the pain but not induce addiction. And it could also help us to better design substitution therapies, which is the cornerstone of opioid use disorder treatment. When people suffer from that they usually receive methadone, or in some countries, even heroin as a substitution drug. And now that we know how heroin and methadone activates these both circuits, we can improve those substitution therapies.Nick Petrić HoweAnd you know, you mentioned a couple of different opioids there. This study was about fentanyl, so do you think this sort of mechanism is broadly applicable to opioids?Christian LüscherYou're right, we need to formally test this. But from all we know, it's the exact same receptors that is activated, because when you take out the new receptors, all effects of the opiates are gone. And so, by extension, we are confident that this applies not only to fentanyl, but also to other opiates. The reason why we chose fentanyl is because it is a drug of public concern. But it is also a very rapidly active drug and that helps us to parse the effects. The faster a drug, the easier it is to see under experimental conditions.Nick Petrić HoweAnd you know, this study was in mice, what do you think needs to be done to translate this to humans?Christian LüscherWell, we know that these receptors and these brain circuits also exists in humans, and we can image them with functional technologies such as functional MRI, and I think our clinical colleagues now can use our sort of blueprint of what one has to look for, to confirm or not whether the same mechanisms apply to human people with addiction.Nick Petrić HoweThat was Christian Lüscher, from the University of Geneva, in Switzerland.

Right now, though, it’s time for the Research Highlights, with Dan Fox.<music>Dan Fox The model of the blood-brain barrier made by combining two organoids could transform how scientists studied drug delivery to the brain. Organoids are groups of lab-grown cells that together form structures resembling an organ. By combining organoids, researchers can make ‘assembloids’ allowing them to study complex biological systems. In this case, a team wanted to learn more about the blood-brain barrier, the layer of cells that regulates which chemicals can pass from the bloodstream into the brain. To replicate the barrier, they combined blood vessel organoids with brain organoids. The blood vessels grew into the brain tissue creating networks of capillaries, and the team found that the same types of cell were present in the same places in both the ‘assembloid’ and the human blood-brain barrier. The researchers also created models using stem cells from people with a genetic disorder that causes the blood-brain barrier to fail. These yielded ‘assembloids’ that replicated the donors’ disease. Read that research in full in Cell Stem Cell.<music> Dan Fox An edible gel based on milk protein can both prevent and treat alcohol intoxication in mice. Harmful alcohol consumption leads to millions of deaths each year. And while treatments exist for severe intoxication, many of them need to be injected directly into a vein and provide only temporary relief from symptoms. Now, researchers have developed an alternative, by combining single iron atoms with nanometre-scale threads of a milk protein that is a by-product of cheesemaking. The team found that the gel could reduce alcohol levels in the blood of intoxicated mice and even prevent mice from becoming intoxicated in the first place. They say that their approach has potential for human use in a clinical setting. If you want to read that paper, you can find it in Nature Nanotechnology.<music> Lizzie Gibney Finally on the show, it’s time for the Briefing Chat where we discuss a couple of articles that have been featured in the Nature Briefing. Nick, what have you been reading about this time?Nick Petrić Howe Well, I've been reading about how babies are suing the South Korean government. And this was a story I was reading in Nature.Lizzie Gibney I'm so intrigued by this.Nick Petrić Howe Well, I should say it's not literally the babies taking the government to court is their parents using them as the plaintiff in this particular case. And it's about climate change. So, you've probably heard the various different climate change cases against governments for not doing their part or not doing enough in the view of those people to tackle climate change. And the idea is that for these younger folk it’s their futures that are being ruined. So, it may have a bit more of an effect on the government to say like, hey, you know, you're infringing on our human rights by not doing enough.Lizzie Gibney And is this somewhat unprecedented? Have babies taken people to court before?Nick Petrić Howe So, children across the world have actually taken governments to court. I think babies is quite unusual and, in this case, there's actually an unborn child as well who's one of the plaintiffs involved, obviously, again, it's the parents it's not literally the unborn child. But the idea, like I say, is that tackling climate change should protect future generations, and it's their– and it's their futures that will be affected if we don't do enough against climate change.Lizzie Gibney Yeah, it makes sense. What are the South Korean government doing or not doing that, you know, these families, including the babies want to happen?Nick Petrić Howe So currently, the South Korean government's targets are to reduce their emissions by 40% below their 2018 levels by 2030. Which sounds like a lot but if every country did that, that would still commit us to three degrees of warming by the end of the century. And you know, that's beyond the sort of limits that were agreed at Paris. And so, the argument here is that is insufficient, so they want to see more action. And this is done at a particular time as well, because this year, the Korean government will have to present their revised climate targets to the United Nations. And so, the people involved in this case, hope it will convince the government to, you know, be a bit more ambitious for the next 2035 target.Lizzie Gibney So, is this mostly a, you know, a public relations thing to get support for these kinds of changes to their targets? Or, you know, in the actual case, is there some kind of potential outcome that sees the government having to what I guess give a huge payout or something? Like what legally could happen if the families win?Nick Petrić Howe So, if there was a constitutional ruling that the South Korean government's targets were insufficient, they would have to enhance their climate ambition. So, there could be a very direct–Lizzie Gibney –it could force their hand to do something–Nick Petrić Howe –basically force their hand. And this has been seen, like across the world, as I said, like there have been other such cases, like in Switzerland, there was a famous one where similar things occurred. But the interesting thing about this one, as well, is this is the first case of its kind in East Asia — this really hasn't been done there. And the people involved are really hopeful that this will provoke more of these kinds of litigations against governments in East Asia, because really, we need everyone in the world involved. But in the past, in East Asia, people have seen litigation as a last resort, and this may make them reconsider how they use litigation.Lizzy Gibney We often think of with climate change, you know, there not been much we can do as an individual, but I guess this is one of the things you can do is sue your government.Nick Petrić Howe No, exactly, and the people involved in this case are quite optimistic as well. They say even if they lose this case, it's provoking a conversation is provoking social awareness and it could start change happening more and more.Lizzie Gibney Shall we talk about my story next?Nick Petrić Howe Yeah, let's do it. What have you been reading this week?Lizzie Gibney Well, it's literally my own story. Little bit cheeky. I bought my own story, so it's obviously by me in Nature. And this is about a new kind of nuclear power source, a heater based on the radioactive decay of an element called americium, which is actually a by-product of nuclear waste. And that's going on the European Space Agency's ExoMars mission, and Europe has never had its own one of these before. And no one's ever made one of these kind of nuclear heaters out of this particular element, americium, before either, so it's– it's a double first.Nick Petrić Howe Yeah, a lot of firsts going on here. But I guess, first of all, what is this heater going to be used for? Literally just heating the spacecraft? Or is there something more?Lizzie Gibney That right. So, it can get very, very cold in space, and to operate all kinds of components you need a heater. And this is very, very long lasting. That's the beauty of these radioactive decay-kind of heaters. So as the americium decays, it just releases heat. And in this case, it's actually going to be warming things within the landing platform. So, you have the kind of mothership that gets you out there to Mars, and then you have the lander comes out of that and lands and then that turns into a landing platform, that then ejects the rover out onto the surface. So that's the Rosalind Franklin rover. So there are going to be some similar kind of heaters made by NASA on the rover, but the ones made by Europe, these new pioneering ones are going to be on the landing platform itself. So it says slightly complimentary, it's not– it's not– it's not the big guns, they haven't put them yet on the rover, which is where they'd be really, really, really important. But they’re still doing an important job there on this landing platform. So they're keeping the landing platform going for much longer than it probably would do otherwise.Nick Petrić Howe And why would you need to have the landing platform I guess, sort of heated up? Mars is pretty cold, I gather, but what is the advantage?Lizzie Gibney Exactly, so it is cold there, so it will be going to Mars with its own batteries that only lasts a certain amount of time. This will keep the batteries warm and that means that the lander will have power for longer. So if there's a problem, say or there's some issue with unfurling the landing platform and getting the rover out, the rover derives all its power from the landing platform before it's deployed on the surface, and it gets out of solar panels. So this will mean basically that anything that goes wrong with the rover exiting out onto the surface, we have a little bit more of a window to save the mission. So it could turn out to be really important.Nick Petrić Howe And are there extra considerations they need to make sort of sending nuclear material into space? I mean, space missions are quite dangerous, at the best of time.Lizzie Gibney Hugely. So until now only NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian Space Agency have made these kinds of nuclear-powered heaters, and similar batteries. So, ESA is not quite ready to do the battery-kind where you turn the heat into electricity, but it's getting there as well. But so far, it's always been NASA or Russia. And they have made theirs from plutonium and they have supplied everyone else. So, in previous years, previous ESA missions, they've just use American or Russian heaters and batteries. What happened here with ExoMars, of course, is it was a collaboration with Russia. And then following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that partnership was severed. And so, ESA has had to go back to the drawing board on a lot of fronts and figure out how to make this mission work. So, this is one tiny glimmer of opportunity in there and that they've said, okay, you know, what we're gonna do, we don't have the Russian heaters anymore, we're gonna use our own new pioneering type.Now, I realised I’ve gone off your question which was about how difficult is to make these and that is to say that very, very difficult, so they've only had plutonium ones up until now. And they require a huge amount of safety checks and certification before you can fly them. Obviously, what you're doing is effectively putting something radioactive on the top of a massive rocket, which is just another kind of fancy word for a bomb, really, and shooting it up into space. Okay, so they have to be really, really well encased so that they could withstand almost anything happening during launch. So those processes are going on right now. There's been some research teams that have been working on this since about 2009 on, you know there are so many different stages, how do we get this the americium, how do we get it? Well, it comes from nuclear waste, but can you take it out nuclear waste, and convert it into little kind of fuel pellets? You know, how do you do that? Then how do you build a device around it, because it's a lot, you get a lot less power for your gramme than you do with plutonium, which is what they've used till now. So, you need to just redesign the whole thing around that you need a bigger volume. So, they've been doing that. And then now we're in the kind of final stages, which is making sure it's all really safe. And so, this is going to launch in 2028. So, it feels like a long way off but I think it's gonna go in the blink of an eye, isn't it. So, they've probably got a lot of work to do.Nick Petrić Howe Well, hopefully we can come back in four years and see where it's at, then and hopefully all goes well for them. But I think that's all we've got time for on the Briefing Chat today.

Human body lice could harbor the plague and spread it through biting ,"Study finds human body lice can transmit plague bacteria  In a recent study published in the journal PLOS Biology, researchers adapt a strain of human body lice to a membrane feeder to study its infection dynamics with Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of the plague. Study: Yersinia pestis can infect the Pawlowsky glands of human body lice and be transmitted by louse bite. Image Credit: PPK_studio / Shutterstock.comHuman body lice, otherwise known as Pediculus humanus humanus, are blood-feeding parasites that thrive in conditions of poor hygiene. They are known vectors for pathogens like Bartonella quintana, Borrelia recurrentis, and Rickettsia prowazekii; however, their role in transmitting Y. pestis is controversial.Although traditionally implicated fleas and rats are well-established vectors, recent studies suggest that human lice may also potentially transmit plague and, as a result, may have been involved in previous pandemics, including the Black Plague.Experimental evidence shows that lice can become infected with Y. pestis, especially at high bacteremia levels, and transmit the bacterium; however, their efficiency and survival rates post-infection are variable. Previous experiments have reported low transmission rates, whereas more recent studies using rabbit-adapted lice showed higher transmission but rapid louse mortality.Thus, further research is needed to clarify the role of body lice in plague transmission, including minimum infective doses, infection duration, and transmission mechanisms. To address this gap, researchers in the present study employed a standardized membrane feeder-adapted body louse model to evaluate the vector competence of lice for Y. pestis.The San Francisco strain of human body louse was used in the study. Direct and delayed transfer were both used to investigate body louse vector competence for Y. pestis. Lice infection rates, mortality, bacterial transmission, and fecal shedding were monitored for one week.Engineered strains of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, or Escherichia coli strains expressing mCherry were isolated on blood agar plates and cultured in brain-heart infusion broth. Fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to investigate the colonization sites of Y. pestis in body lice and underlying transmission mechanisms.The transmission efficacies of the bacterium with different feeding periods ranging from three to 20 hours were determined and compared in Pawlowsky gland (PG)-infected and midgut-only infected lice. Varying infectious blood doses ranging from 104 to 107 colony-forming units (CFUs)/ml were used to simulate human bacteremia for analysis.The minimum bacteremia level required for chronic infection in body lice and PG colonization was determined. The infectivity and transmission potential of various bacterial strains, including Y. pestis and E. coli, were also examined in human body lice.The delayed transfer group showed higher but non-significant infection rates, mortality, and transmission rates. Both scenarios demonstrated that body lice could become chronically infected and effectively transmit Y. pestis, with their transmission efficiency remaining stable or improving by the seventh day despite Y. pestis-induced mortality.Three localization patterns of Y. pestis were observed in the lice: no detectable bacteria, bacteria only in the midgut, and bacteria in the head with or without midgut presence. About 14% of infected lice developed head infections in PGs, with these structures speculated to assist in mouthpart lubrication. Y. pestis was found in PGs and their ducts through IHC, thus supporting their role in transmitting the bacteria.Only lice with PG infections transmitted Y. pestis during the three-hour feeding period, with a median of 68 CFU recovered. Comparatively, during the 20-hour feeding assays, PG-infected lice consistently transmitted higher CFUs with a median of 2,000 CFU/louse compared to midgut-only lice.Post-assay, all PG-infected lice remained infected, as compared to only 75% of midgut-only lice. Y. pestis was found in the heads of all PG-infected lice, thus indicating that PG infection enhances transmission efficiency.A minimum bacteremia level of 1.2 x 105 CFU/ml was required for Y. pestis to reliably cause chronic infection in body lice with subsequent PG colonization. While chronic infection was observed at a rate of 58% at 108 CFU/ml, PG infection, and transmission occurred at bacteremia levels above or equal to 107 CFU/ml. Fecal transmission potential was observed even at low bacteremia.Chronic infection of the body louse midgut occurred within a range commonly noted in clinical case reports, whereas PG infection occurred at the upper range of human plague bacteremia. However, all tested bacterial strains could colonize body lice midguts; only Yersinia spp. could infect PGs. Infection and transmission rates were comparable among all bacterial strains.The current study provides strong evidence supporting the role of human body lice as potential vectors for plague transmission. With their larger blood intake, frequent feeding, and lack of key immunity genes, human body lice are efficiently infected by and transmit Y. pestis.Historical outbreaks, which correlate with peak rodent flea activity, indicate that body lice may have contributed significantly to the transmission of the plague under specific conditions. Thus, the study findings emphasize the importance of considering multiple vectors in formulating disease control strategies.Posted in: Medical Science News   Medical Research News   Disease/Infection NewsTags: Assay, Bacteria, Blood, Borrelia, Brain, Chronic, E. coli, Fluorescence, Fluorescence Microscopy, Genes, Heart, Hygiene, IHC, immunity, Immunohistochemistry, Membrane, Microscopy, Mortality, Plague, Research, RickettsiaWritten byDr. Sushama R.

Extreme heat will put millions more older adults at risk in the future,"Extreme heat will put millions more older adults at risk in the future  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Acute heat exposures are expected to increase as temperatures and aging populations riseAn older man shields himself from the heat in Beijing in July of 2023. By mid-century, more adults age 69 and older will face extreme heat, especially those residing in Asia and Africa.Wang Zho/AFPBy Aimee CunninghamMay 14, 2024 at 11:00 amNearly a quarter of the global population of older adults at mid-century could face extreme heat, putting their health in danger.By 2050, as many as an additional 246 million adults age 69 and older could experience temperature extremes that exceed 37.5° Celsius, researchers report May 14 in Nature Communications. The new projection suggests that more than 23 percent of the global population of these older adults — largely concentrated in Africa and Asia — will encounter this intense heat, compared with 14 percent today.“Protecting our older population will be increasingly critical in the years to come,” says cardiologist-epidemiologist Andrew Chang of Stanford University and the University of California, San Fransisco, who was not involved with the research. “Older adults can be exquisitely vulnerable to the impacts of heat.”Exposure to hot temperatures is physiologically demanding, and there is a limit to how much heat the body can tolerate (SN: 8/6/2023; SN: 7/27/2022). Heat extremes are especially risky for older adults for many reasons. The aging body can’t cool off as efficiently. Older adults often have chronic illnesses that are worsened by heat, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. People in this age group commonly take medications that are dehydrating. And some older adults are socially isolated, are limited in their mobility or have cognitive impairments.“It’s this kind of perfect storm of biological aging, social loneliness and then cognition that make [heat] so much worse for older people,” says Deborah Carr, a sociologist of aging at Boston University.Carr and colleagues projected the population of those age 69 and up by 2050 and estimated the impact of climate change on the regions where these older adults will reside. The researchers assessed chronic heat exposure — prolonged exposure to uncomfortable heat — and acute exposures, which are short-lived but extreme, such as during a heat wave. The team found that chronic exposure, calculated by taking the average temperature across all days of a year and determining how many degrees each day exceed a threshold temperature of comfort, will increase worldwide by 2050.In terms of acute heat, there will be an increase worldwide in the number of days each year that exceed 37.5° C, from an average of 10 days to around 20. There will also be a greater upper bound to how high temperatures can reach during extreme heat, depending on the region. “Both the frequency and the intensity will increase as a result of climate change,” says Giacomo Falchetta, a climate change researcher at the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change in Venice, Italy.The team also looked at the contribution of the two factors, population aging and increasing heat, to understand which was driving the projected results depending on the region. In regions in the Global South, which have historically been hotter, a growing share of the population is aging. Regions in the Global North, which are “colder and older,” Carr says, “are experiencing more heat extremes.”There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to reduce the risks from increasing heat exposure to older adults, Falchetta says, but options include strengthening health care infrastructure, ensuring sufficient nutrition and hydration, implementing heat early warning systems, providing public cooling centers and expanding green spaces and tree cover to reduce urban heat island effects (SN: 4/3/2018).As for the study’s projections, there remains uncertainty on the climate, Falchetta says, depending on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding the demographic changes, “these people have already been born — they are people like me,” he says. Countries need to “start planning now on how to accommodate the needs of those people in the future.”Questions or comments on this article?

Irregular bone marrow cells may increase heart disease risk,"Irregular bone marrow cells may increase heart disease risk  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Genetic errors in bone marrow cells are passed to immune cells, which can ramp up inflammationIn the last decade, scientists have discovered that clonal hematopoiesis — when bone marrow stem cells acquire key genetic errors and pass them on to immune cells — is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The Good Brigade/Getty ImagesBy Aimee CunninghamApril 26, 2024 at 7:00 amLowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels, quitting smoking, managing diabetes: these evidence-backed approaches remain key ways to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (SN: 11/9/15).But an unexpected contributor to that risk has emerged in the past decade. Nothing can be done to specifically tackle this risk factor yet, but the discovery offers a new angle to understanding cardiovascular disease. And it might partly explain why some people develop the disease even when they don’t check the familiar boxes on the modifiable risk list. A 2021 Lancet study found that of just over 62,000 people who had had serious heart attacks from 2005 to 2018, 15 percent did not smoke and did not have high cholesterol, high blood pressure or diabetes.The newly found risk arises from specialized cells, called stem cells, that live in the bone marrow. These cells can make copies of themselves or transform into blood and immune cells. Over time, the stem cells acquire genetic mistakes, giving some an edge in terms of self-renewal. Eventually, those stem cells can outnumber others in the bone marrow, providing more opportunities to pass the genetic errors on to blood and immune cells. This state, called clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, or CHIP, is one step on the path to potentially developing blood cancer.But CHIP has also turned out to be linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. And in terms of that risk, “it’s up there,” says Amy Lin, a cardiologist and physician-scientist at the University of California, San Fransisco. High blood pressure, excessive cholesterol and current or former smoking each increase the risk by a factor of 1.2 to 1.4, while CHIP ups the risk by a factor of almost 2. (Diabetes and older age, especially at 70 years and older, contribute even more to risk.)Studies of CHIP in animals suggest what may be going on in people’s bodies to boost risk. In mice, CHIP increases inflammation and accelerates the buildup of fat-laden plaques in arterial walls, a process called atherosclerosis, which can lead to a heart attack.As scientists develop a better understanding of its impact on inflammation and atherosclerosis, it’s possible that CHIP could be a target for treatment. “We‘ve got 10 [or] 15 years of really new science to do,” says cardiologist and physician-scientist Peter Libby of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Studying clonal hematopoiesis and how it influences the development of cardiovascular disease, Libby says, “is going to open up many many doors.”The genetic errors connected to CHIP are not inherited. Instead, these mutations pop up over time. “As we age, we get mutations,” says oncologist and physician-scientist Kelly Bolton of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “It’s just by chance.” When this happens in particular genes in a bone marrow stem cell, “it can lead that cell to have an advantage” in its ability to renew itself. The copies have the errors, as do the blood or immune cells derived from these stem cells.Many people have CHIP by adulthood, “but it’s present at very low levels,” Bolton says. The degree of CHIP — and its overall prevalence — generally increases with age, as it can take time for a population of clones to grow. The larger the proportion of cells with errors in the genes tied to CHIP, the greater the risk of health issues, says Bolton. It’s a continuum.Of the genes connected to CHIP so far, those that are most commonly mutated regulate other genes or respond to genetic damage. It takes additional genetic errors beyond the ones that kick off CHIP to develop cancer. People can have CHIP and never get cancer.And it has turned out that there is more to CHIP than meets the eye. In 2014 in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers reported on an analysis of DNA data from past studies totaling more than 5,000 people. The likelihood of dying from any cause was higher, by a factor of 1.4, for people with CHIP compared with people without it, over a period of roughly eight years. In a twist, “it wasn’t cancer-related deaths that people were dying of most often when they had CHIP,” says physician-scientist Siddhartha Jaiswal of the Stanford School of Medicine. “It was actually cardiovascular causes.”“That was interesting to us,” Jaiswal says. In a follow-up study published in 2017 in the same journal, Jaiswal and colleagues analyzed DNA data from past studies of people with and without coronary heart disease, which occurs when plaques form in the arteries that provide blood to the heart. People with CHIP had a risk of developing coronary heart disease almost two times as high as those without. Forty of the 443 with coronary heart disease had CHIP compared with 37 of the 577 without the disease.In the same study, Jaiswal and colleagues also investigated the impact of CHIP on mice bred to be more susceptible to developing plaques in their arteries. The mice received bone marrow transplants that either would or would not initiate CHIP. Then the mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet. The mice with CHIP had larger plaques and more inflammation compared with the mice without CHIP.Molecular biologist Ken Walsh of the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville and his colleagues reported similar findings in their 2017 Science study on the impact of CHIP in atherosclerosis-prone mice. Walsh’s team’s work also nodded toward the possibility that something could be done about the increased risk of cardiovascular disease from CHIP. When the researchers blocked excessive inflammation that occurred in the CHIP mice, there was no longer a difference in the size of their plaques compared with the non-CHIP mice. “We could reverse the effect” that CHIP had on the development of atherosclerosis in the mice, Walsh says.Research over the last few decades has indicated that chronic inflammation is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In general, plaques start forming with the accumulation of “bad” cholesterol and immune cells in the arterial wall, including cells called macrophages that try to gobble up the cholesterol. Inflammation plays a role in the formation of the plaque, and as the plaque comes together, it kick-starts a series of cellular actions that further amplify inflammation.It looks like having CHIP adds even more inflammation, driven by the immune cells derived from the mutated stem cells. That’s suggested in the studies in mice, and in research on macrophages with errors in genes tied to CHIP, which has found the cells become “hyper-inflammatory,” Jaiswal says. “We think that having more immune cells in your blood vessel wall is bad. [CHIP] increases the amount of inflammation that the immune cells have. That leads to even more immune cells going to the area,” he says. “So it kind of just speeds the whole process” of plaque development.It might be possible to block extra inflammation that comes from CHIP in people. That hint came from a large clinical study that began before the link between CHIP and cardiovascular disease was reported. The trial enrolled more than 10,000 participants who previously had had a heart attack; some received one of three doses of a treatment that blocks an inflammatory protein. The participants on 150 mg of the treatment had a slight reduction, 15 percent, in the risk of developing another heart attack or stroke or dying from cardiovascular issues compared with those not on the treatment. There were close to four of these cardiovascular events per 100 people per year in the treated group versus 4.5 events per 100 per year in the group not given the treatment.However, the inflammatory protein targeted in the trial is also important for an effective immune response, and the treatment led to more fatal infections. In the end, the heart health benefit wasn’t enough to counter that infection risk. But when the clinical trial team learned of the effect of CHIP on cardiovascular disease, the group, which included Peter Libby, wondered: “If CHIP is involved in inflammation and we’ve got an anti-inflammatory, could we get a bigger bang in people who had CHIP?” Libby says.Although the clinical trial had concluded, the team had blood samples for nearly 4,000 participants. There were 338 with CHIP. Those who had errors in one of the main genes tied to CHIP, called TET2, had a 62 percent reduction in the risk of developing a heart attack or stroke or dying from cardiovascular issues, Libby and colleagues reported in 2022 in JAMA Cardiology. “Lo and behold,” Libby says, people with TET2 CHIP “had an outsized benefit” from the treatment.Figuring out how inflammation and CHIP are involved in cardiovascular disease “does not displace or demote” contributions from excessive cholesterol, high blood pressure or other modifiable risk factors, Libby says. “By no means do we think CHIP is the be–all and end–all or the only cause of atherosclerosis — it works together with the standard risk factors to boost your risk.”As of now, there isn’t a way to specifically temper CHIP’s impact on cardiovascular disease risk. So it would not be helpful for most people to learn whether they have CHIP. Nor is that testing widely available. CHIP tends to be discovered when people undergo genetic testing because they have cancer or symptoms suggestive of cancer. At this point, trying to prevent cardiovascular disease in those with CHIP relies on modifying the standard risk factors.Beyond the treatment potential, research into CHIP may also prove helpful in explaining two mysteries: why some people who don’t have the familiar risk contributors can still develop cardiovascular disease, and why the likelihood of developing the disease increases with age. “People have always thought that there’s still some sort of dark matter out there,” Walsh says. “So maybe what’s filling some of this void — some — is clonal hematopoiesis.”Questions or comments on this article?

A protein found in sweat may protect people from Lyme disease,"A protein found in human sweat may protect against Lyme disease   Suggestions or feedback?             Previous image Next image              Lyme disease, a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks, affects nearly half a million people in the United States every year. In most cases, antibiotics effectively clear the infection, but for some patients, symptoms linger for months or years.Researchers at MIT and the University of Helsinki have now discovered that human sweat contains a protein that can protect against Lyme disease. They also found that about one-third of the population carries a genetic variant of this protein that is associated with Lyme disease in genome-wide association studies.It’s unknown exactly how the protein inhibits the growth of the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, but the researchers hope to harness the protein’s protective abilities to create skin creams that could help prevent the disease, or to treat infections that don’t respond to antibiotics.“This protein may provide some protection from Lyme disease, and we think there are real implications here for a preventative and possibly a therapeutic based on this protein,” says Michal Caspi Tal, a principal research scientist in MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering and one of the senior authors of the new study.Hanna Ollila, a senior researcher at the Institute for Molecular Medicine at the University of Helsinki and a researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, is also a senior author of the paper, which appears today in Nature Communications. The paper’s lead author is Satu Strausz, a postdoc at the Institute for Molecular Medicine at the University of Helsinki.A surprising linkLyme disease is most often caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. In the United States, this bacterium is spread by ticks that are carried by mice, deer, and other animals. Symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a distinctive bulls-eye rash.Most patients receive doxycycline, an antibiotic that usually clears up the infection. In some patients, however, symptoms such as fatigue, memory problems, sleep disruption, and body aches can persist for months or years.Tal and Ollila, who were postdocs together at Stanford University, began this study a few years ago in hopes of finding genetic markers of susceptibility to Lyme disease. To that end, they decided to run a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a Finnish dataset that contains genome sequences for 410,000 people, along with detailed information on their medical histories.This dataset includes about 7,000 people who had been diagnosed with Lyme disease, allowing the researchers to look for genetic variants that were more frequently found in people who had had Lyme disease, compared with those who hadn’t.This analysis revealed three hits, including two found in immune molecules that had been previously linked with Lyme disease. However, their third hit was a complete surprise — a secretoglobin called SCGB1D2.Secretoglobins are a family of proteins found in tissues that line the lungs and other organs, where they play a role in immune responses to infection. The researchers discovered that this particular secretoglobin is produced primarily by cells in the sweat glands.To find out how this protein might influence Lyme disease, the researchers created normal and mutated versions of SCGB1D2 and exposed them to Borrelia burgdorferi grown in the lab. They found that the normal version of the protein significantly inhibited the growth of Borrelia burgdorferi. However, when they exposed bacteria to the mutated version, twice as much protein was required to suppress bacterial growth.The researchers then exposed bacteria to either the normal or mutated variant of SCGB1D2 and injected them into mice. Mice injected with the bacteria exposed to the mutant protein became infected with Lyme disease, but mice injected with bacteria exposed to the normal version of SCGB1D2 did not.“In the paper we show they stayed healthy until day 10, but we followed the mice for over a month, and they never got infected. This wasn’t a delay, this was a full stop. That was really exciting,” Tal says.Preventing infectionAfter the MIT and University of Helsinki researchers posted their initial findings on a preprint server, researchers in Estonia replicated the results of the genome-wide association study, using data from the Estonian Biobank. These data, from about 210,000 people, including 18,000 with Lyme disease, were later added to the final Nature Communications study.The researchers aren’t sure yet how SCGB1D2 inhibits bacterial growth, or why the variant is less effective. However, they did find that the variant causes a shift from the amino acid proline to leucine, which may interfere with the formation of a helix found in the normal version.They now plan to investigate whether applying the protein to the skin of mice, which do not naturally produce SCGB1D2, could prevent them from being infected by Borrelia burgdorferi. They also plan to explore the protein’s potential as a treatment for infections that don’t respond to antibiotics.“We have fantastic antibiotics that work for 90 percent of people, but in the 40 years we’ve known about Lyme disease, we have not budged that,” Tal says. “Ten percent of people don’t recover after having antibiotics, and there’s no treatment for them.”“This finding opens the door to a completely new approach to preventing Lyme disease in the first place, and it will be interesting to see if it could be useful for preventing other types of skin infections too,” says Kara Spiller, a professor of biomedical innovation in the School of Biomedical Engineering at Drexel University, who was not involved in the study.The researchers note that people who have the protective version of SCGB1D2 can still develop Lyme disease, and they should not assume that they won’t. One factor that may play a role is whether the person happens to be sweating when they’re bitten by a tick carrying Borrelia burgdorferi.SCGB1D2 is just one of 11 secretoglobin proteins produced by the human body, and Tal also plans to study what some of those other secretoglobins may be doing in the body, especially in the lungs, where many of them are found.“The thing I’m most excited about is this idea that secretoglobins might be a class of antimicrobial proteins that we haven’t thought about. As immunologists, we talk nonstop about immunoglobulins, but I had never heard of a secretoglobin before this popped up in our GWAS study. This is why it’s so fun for me now. I want to know what they all do,” she says.The research was funded, in part, by Emily and Malcolm Fairbairn, the Instrumentarium Science Foundation, the Academy of Finland, the Finnish Medical Foundation, the Younger Family, and the Bay Area Lyme Foundation.MIT researchers have discovered a protein found in human sweat that holds antimicrobial properties and can “inhibit the growth of the bacteria that causes Lyme disease,” reports Matt Fortin for NENC. The team believes this “type of protein could be put into a topical cream to make something called ‘Lyme Block’ – like sunblock, but for preventing Lyme.”  ""Ideally what we would love to do is give people more control over their own risk,"" says Principal Research Scientist Michal Tal. ""And really try to develop this into a possible preventative that you could put on repellant or sunblock to protect against other elements of the outdoors that you could also protect yourself against Lyme.""Researchers from MIT and elsewhere have isolated a “protein in human sweat that protects against Lyme disease,” reports Matthew Rozsa for Salon. The researchers believe that if “properly harnessed the protein could form the basis of skin creams that either prevent the disease or treat especially persistent infections,” writes Rosza.

Don’t use unsterilized tap water to rinse your sinuses. It may carry brain-eating amoebas,"What to know about another dangerous amoeba linked to neti pots and nasal rinsing    Associated Press                       Associated Press                  Leave your feedbackNEW YORK (AP) — For years, scientists have known people who use neti pots can become infected with a brain-eating amoeba if they use the wrong kind of water. On Wednesday, researchers linked a second kind of deadly amoeba to nasal rinsing.WATCH: Why does it hurt to get water up your nose?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report that for the first time connects Acanthamoeba infections to neti pots and other nasal rinsing devices. Officials also renewed their warning that extremely rare, but potentially deadly, consequences can come from flushing nasal passages with common tap water.“We published this study because we want people to be aware of this risk,” said the CDC’s Dr. Julia Haston.Neti pots are one of the better known tools of nasal rinsing. They look like small teapots with long spouts, and usually are made of ceramic or plastic.Users fill them with a saline solution, then pour the liquid in one nostril. It comes out the other, draining the nasal passage of allergens and other bothersome contaminants.Neti pot use in the U.S. has boomed in the last couple of decades, driven in part by the increasing prevalence of allergies and other respiratory diseases, market researchers say.There also are other methods of rinsing nasal passages, including specially shaped cups and squeezable plastic bottles.Tap water in the U.S. is treated to meet safe drinking standards, but low levels of microscopic organisms can still be found in it. It’s usually not a problem when people drink or cook with the water, but it can pose more of a danger when tap water is used for other purposes — like in humidifiers or for nasal irrigation.CDC officials, citing a 2021 survey, say about one-third of U.S. adults incorrectly think tap water was free of bacteria and other microorganisms. Nearly two-thirds say tap water could be safely used for rinsing their sinuses.The CDC recommends using boiled, sterile or distilled water.If tap water is used, it must be boiled for a minimum of one minute — or three minutes at higher elevations — before it is cooled and used, officials say.More than a decade ago, health officials linked U.S. deaths from a brain-eating amoeba — named Naegleria fowleri — to nasal rinsing. More recently, they started to note nasal rinsing as a common theme in illnesses caused by another microscopic parasite, Acanthamoeba.Acanthamoeba causes different kinds of illness but is still dangerous, with a 85% fatality rate in reported cases.“These infections are very serious and even life threatening,” said Haston who was lead author of the report published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.The new study focused on 10 patients who fell ill between 1994 and 2022, three of whom died. Researchers say they can’t be sure how the patients were infected, but they noted several commonalities: All had weakened immune systems and practiced nasal rinsing.Seven patients reported nasal rinsing for relief of chronic sinus infections, and at least two of them used neti pots. Two other patients did nasal rinsing as part of a cleansing ritual that is part of Indian tradition.This amoeba can be found naturally all over the environment — in lakes, rivers, seawater and soil.It can cause diseases of the skin and sinuses, and can infect the brain, where it can cause a deadly form of inflammation. The microorganism also been connected to non-fatal, but sight-threatening, eye infections, sometimes through contaminated contact lens solution.U.S. health officials have identified about 180 infections from the single-cell organism since the first one was diagnosed in 1956.In the vast majority of cases, researcher don’t know exactly how people became infected. But in reviewing cases in recent decades, CDC researchers increasingly received information that a number of the cases had done nasal rinsing, Haston said.Research also has indicated it’s common in tap water. A study done in Ohio in the 1990s found more than half of tap water samples studied contained the amoeba and similar microorganisms. “It’s very likely that we’re all exposed to Acanthamoeba all the time,” she said.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

The U.S. now has a drug for severe frostbite. How does it work?,"The U.S. now has a drug for severe frostbite. How does it work?  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Approved by the FDA in February, iloprost can prevent the need to amputate frozen fingers and toesBundled in layers of warm clothing, a pedestrian in Minneapolis braves a day that was so bitterly cold that officials warned of a heightened risk of frostbite. A newly FDA-approved drug, iloprost, can help to treat severe frostbite.STEPHEN MATUREN/AFP via Getty ImagesBy Saugat BolakheMarch 12, 2024 at 9:00 amIn the worst cases, frostbite can cause the tissues in fingers, toes, noses and other extremities to die and require amputation. Now doctors in the United States have a way to save patients from these life-altering effects.In February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the country’s first medication to treat severe frostbite. In a clinical trial, the drug, iloprost, greatly reduced amputations in nearly all the frostbite patients who received it.Although frostbite affects a relatively small number of people in the United States — a few thousand annually — it is a major concern for people who must spend a lot of time outside in the cold, such as mountain climbers, people in the military and people without housing.A synthetic drug first developed in Germany in 1980s, iloprost, also known by the brand name Aurlumyn, is given by injection. It works as a vasodilator, meaning it widens blood vessels, improves blood flow and prevents risk of blood clotting. It was primarily used to treat Raynaud’s disease, a disorder that causes blood vessels in the fingers and toes to narrow, as well as to treat blood pressure–related illnesses.A study published in 1994 was the first to test if the drug may also be able to open up jammed blood vessels as a result of frostbite. It was tested in five patients, successfully recovering their frostbitten digits in all cases.The drug subsequently showed promising results in studies done in England, France and Nepal. In the clinical trial cited by the FDA in its approval of iloprost, patients rescued from high altitudes were randomly assigned to treatment with either buflomedil (another vasodilator), iloprost or iloprost plus a drug that breaks down blood clots. Out of the 47 patients treated over 12 years, none of the 16 patients that received iloprost alone had to have digits amputated, researchers reported in 2011 in the New England Journal of Medicine. In comparison, nine of 15 patients in the buflomedil group needed amputations as did three of 16 patients in the iloprost combination group.Iloprost is already an approved treatment for frostbite for years in a number of European countries and elsewhere in the world. Science News talked with Chris Imray, a vascular surgeon at University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire in England who has been treating patients with this drug for more than a decade, about what frostbite does to the body, how the drug works and what it will mean for patient treatment in the United States. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.SN: What happens in the body during frostbite?Imray: Frostbite is a thermal injury that affects [the] hands, feet, nose, ears and occasionally external genitalia after a few hours of cold exposure. When the temperature of the tissue drops to around zero degree Celsius, the blood flow through the tissue slows down. Then you get thrombosis, clots forming within the blood vessels, which subsequently leads to loss of oxygen delivery to the tissue. Over a period of time, you then get gangrene and the tissue dies.SN: How did scientists realize that targeting blood clotting can be useful in frostbite treatment?Imray: If we’ve got a tissue that’s damaged from a thermal injury with poor blood supply, you could try to treat by warming the tissue. But the problem is that if there’s no blood supply, you may warm up the tissue but you won’t restore the oxygen delivery to the tissue, and that actually just speeds up the deterioration.We’ve known for some time in other situations, like stroke or acute coronary syndromes, that if you can restore the blood quickly, within four to six hours, you can restore the blood supply, clear the clots in the small blood vessels, and then oxygen is delivered to the tissues again. One of the treatments for acute coronary syndrome was thrombolytic agents to break down the clot. But if a patient had an accident and has soft tissue or bony injuries, giving them thrombolytic agents may cause more bleeding. Iloprost works as a vasodilator rather than as a lytic agent on the clot. That’s really sort of where it came from.SN: How has iloprost changed treatment of frostbite?Imray: We used to do something called a sympathectomy. Vascular surgeons would cut the sympathetic nerves to open up the blood vessels to the hands or to the feet. Once [iloprost] came out, it seemed to have a similar effect — it would cause the blood vessels to vasodilate. The beauty was you didn’t have to cut the nerves permanently.SN: How is iloprost administered?Imray: The drug is given intravenously and circulates all through the body. We often start at a low dose and then gradually increase the infusion rate, until the patient starts to get side effects — facial flushing, high heart rate or low blood pressure. At that point, we wind it back a very small amount — just enough to get rid of the symptoms. Then we run it for six hours [and repeat] the process for around five days. We can do imaging tests to see if there’s an improvement to the blood supply to the tissues. Then the surgeons will need to manage the tissues that have been almost dead and brought back to life. The overall effect is a dramatic limb and digit salvage rate, which is quite remarkable.SN: How does iloprost work?There are multiple mechanisms that have been put forward for it. One is vasodilation. One is that it seems to affect clotting slightly. And it changes the [ability] of the red blood cells to get through the small vessels.SN: What timing is crucial for treating frostbite?Imray: All tissues have different metabolic rates. The brain has a very high metabolic rate, which is why [there’s] a short window, about six hours, to [break down blood clots] in a stroke. The heart has a little bit longer. And if you don’t get there within that time, the person has permanent tissue damage.We’re not really sure about tissues in the hands, feet and muscles. We thought [within] 24 hours was the maximum time [after frostbite injury for using iloprost], but there have been reports of some people who have gone as long as five days. But the longer you go for the type of injury, the less impressive the effects will be.SN: Who will this new approval benefit most?Imray: We’ve had a number of high-profile climbers who have had [frostbite] injuries where they’ve been told there’s nothing that can be done. And they subsequently lost tissue. So, what we’re trying to do is to identify medical units [close to the big mountains] where iloprost can be given, so that if you have an injury, you can be flown there as quickly as possible.Frostbite also affects homeless people. Sadly, they don’t generate the same concern [as the high-profile climbers], but they can have serious frostbite injuries and end up with life-changing amputations.If you look at people who would be at risk of losing limbs, [the iloprost approval] will transform that. I’m delighted [the FDA has] approved it, but they’ve taken quite a long time to get there.Questions or comments on this article?

More than 1 billion people worldwide are now estimated to have obesity,"More than 1 billion people worldwide are now estimated to have obesity  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	The chronic disease affects roughly one-eighth of the global populationThe global prevalence of obesity has soared over the last 30 years. A new analysis suggests that more than 1 billion people worldwide now live with the chronic disease.miljko/Getty ImagesBy McKenzie PrillamanFebruary 29, 2024 at 6:30 pmIt’s no secret that global obesity rates have been rising over the past few decades. But a new analysis quantifies the upsurge.More than 1 billion people worldwide were living with obesity as of 2022, researchers report February 29 in the Lancet. That’s about one-eighth of the global population (SN: 11/15/22). For comparison, nearly 800 million people had obesity in 2016, according to the World Health Organization, or WHO.Obesity is “defined by the presence of excess body fat that impairs health,” says obesity expert Arya Sharma of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, who was not involved in the study. The chronic disease can raise the risk for conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, and can also limit mobility and negatively affect mental health (SN: 4/22/20).Global health researcher Majid Ezzati and colleagues examined more than 3,600 population-based studies published over the last several decades encompassing 222 million participants across nearly 200 countries and territories. The researchers divided each participant’s reported weight by their height squared to find their body mass index, or BMI.Analyzing the trends suggested that in 2022, almost 900 million adults worldwide had a BMI of 30 or above, classifying them as having obesity. In children and adolescents ages 5 to 19, nearly 160 million were estimated to have the chronic disease, defined as BMI above a certain point on the WHO’s growth reference curves, which account for age and sex.From 1990 to 2022, the prevalence of obesity roughly doubled in women, tripled in men and quadrupled in children and adolescents. At the same time, global rates of those who were underweight fell. “We shouldn’t be thinking about [underweight and obesity] as two separate things, because the transition from one to the other has been very rapid,” says Ezzati, of Imperial College London.The estimated obesity rates should raise alarms, he says. “Governments and societies need to deal with this” through prevention and medical care. Despite new anti-obesity medications like Wegovy showing incredible results, Ezzati adds, their high costs and lack of incorporation in worldwide medical guidance will make them inaccessible to most people for the near future (SN: 12/13/23).Ezzati notes that one of the biggest driving factors of obesity’s increased prevalence is limited access to and the unaffordability of healthy foods. Sharma adds that societal-level lifestyle changes — such as getting less sleep, increased stress levels and spending less time at home — can also lead to eating more processed foods and overconsumption (SN: 12/21/18; SN: 5/16/19).“When you look at appetite, there’s a complex biology behind it,” Sharma says. “And that biology is affected by environmental changes.”Questions or comments on this article?

A lab-made antibody that targets these toxins could be a step toward a universal antivenom.suebg1 photography/Moment/Getty Images PlusBy Meghan RosenFebruary 27, 2024 at 8:15 amThe antivenom for a black mamba’s bite could one day work for a slew of other snakes. Scientists have developed an antibody that shuts down paralyzing toxins in the venom of black mambas, king cobras and dozens of other sharp-toothed serpents. The antibody — a single protein manufactured in the lab — protected mice from otherwise lethal doses of venom, protein engineer Joseph Jardine and colleagues report in the Feb. 21 Science Translational Medicine. That antibody “will be a critical component of an eventual antivenom,” says Jardine, of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif.Venomous snakes generally rely on just a handful of toxin families. If scientists could mix together antibodies targeting each of those types, Jardine says, they could potentially create “one vial of antivenom that works against any snake in the world.” Such a universal antivenom might still be many years away, he says. But “theoretically, this is possible.”Scientists have tallied hundreds of venomous snake species across the globe. In North America, a person might stumble upon a western diamondback; in Africa, a puff adder; in South Asia, a saw-scaled viper. A bite from any one of these snakes can maim or kill. Venomous snakebites kill up to about 140,000 people each year, according to the World Health Organization. Lifesaving antivenoms exist, Jardine says, but they’re “built with 100-year-old technology.” That technology involves injecting animals like horses or sheep with snake venom and harvesting the venom-targeting antibodies that their immune systems churn out. A snakebit patient would then get an infusion of horse or sheep antibodies — if doctors have them in stock. The process has major drawbacks, Jardine says. Each animal produces antibodies for just one type of venom. Currently, bites from a yellow-bellied sea snake, cottonmouth or inland Taipan would all require different treatments. Another issue is the health effects of the antivenom itself. “You’re putting a whole bunch of horse antibodies into a person,” Jardine says. People can get sick or even go into anaphylactic shock. His team’s approach could glide past those problems. In a collection of more than 60 billion lab-made antibodies, the team hunted for ones that target a particularly vicious venom component used by some snakes: long-chain three-finger alpha-neurotoxins. These molecules look like a small hand with three fingers, says biotechnologist Andreas H. Laustsen-Kiel of the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. When delivered into a person’s bloodstream via snakebite, the hand literally gives victims the finger. The toxin’s middle finger pokes into a protein needed for movement, shutting down muscles and paralyzing the body. Antibodies that grasp the finger can block its toxic touch, Laustsen-Kiel says. Last year, his group reported several new antibodies, including a human antibody that neutralizes three-finger toxins like the one in Jardine’s study. But the new antibody “looks like it’s even better than ours,” Laustsen-Kiel says. It appears to grab a wider array of toxins and with a tighter grip, he says. In mice given venom from a black mamba and an Indian spitting cobra, injecting the antibody saved the rodents’ lives, Jardine’s team reports. The researchers are now working to develop antibodies that target other venom toxins. Still, the idea of creating a single, universal antivenom may not be entirely realistic, Laustsen-Kiel says. “It simply doesn’t make sense from a product perspective,” he says. Instead, Laustsen-Kiel envisions antivenoms that are tailored for use in specific regions. Whatever the formulation of these future antivenoms, research on snakebites — considered a neglected tropical disease — is underfunded, Jardine says (SN: 9/19/20). Though millions of cases occur in rural India and Africa, there’s relatively little money available for improving treatments, he says. (Jardine has funding from the London-based global health charity the Wellcome Trust.) Snakebites just aren’t considered a medical priority, Jardine says. But for people whose families and livelihoods depend on their ability to farm, he says, losing life or limb to snakebite is devastating.Questions or comments on this article?

Taking a weight-loss drug reduced a craving for opioids,"Opioid cravings were reduced by anti-obesity drug in small study   Home Don't miss outSubscribe to STAT+ today, for the best life sciences journalism in the industryBy Simar BajajFeb. 17, 2024DENVER — The GLP-1 medication liraglutide significantly reduced opioid cravings in a small analysis presented on Saturday. It is the first randomized controlled trial to test anti-obesity drugs against opioid addiction, which kills around 80,000 people in the U.S. each year.Among 20 patients for opioid use disorder, those on liraglutide experienced a 40% reduction in opioid cravings over the three-week study, with this effect evident at even the lowest liraglutide dose, according to data presented here at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference.advertisementAmong patients already on buprenorphine, a medication approved by the FDA to treat opioid use disorder, those also on liraglutide were more likely to report zero cravings than the placebo group. This effect became statistically significant from the tenth day of the study onward, as patients were titrated to increasingly higher doses of liraglutide. “It suggests there’s an additive effect of these two medications,” said Andrew Saxon, an addiction psychiatrist at the University of Washington who was not involved with this study, potentially because liraglutide and buprenorphine target different mechanisms.Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every dayFor the most part, there were no notable differences in side effects between patients on liraglutide and those on placebo, suggesting that this GLP-1 drug is safe in patients with opioid use disorder. Gastrointestinal distress, however, was twice as common in the liraglutide group and largely responsible for the study’s high dropout rate, with only nine patients completing the three-week trial.However, Scott Bunce, a clinical psychologist at Penn State and one of the trial’s principal investigators, noted that patients who received both liraglutide and buprenorphine had lower GI distress and dropout rates than participants on liraglutide alone, suggesting that the combination approach could alleviate some of these issues. Furthermore, the finding that cravings were significantly reduced at the lowest liraglutide dose suggests that many of these side effects could be mitigated by maintaining a low dose, although this merits further study.advertisementThe study was conducted at the Caron Treatment Center in Wernersville, Pa., and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a donor family, and the pharma company Novo Nordisk, which sells liraglutide as Victoza for diabetes and Saxenda for obesity. The patients were all residential, having just undergone medication-assisted withdrawal.About 80% of participants were white men, and everyone received a notification on their phones four times a day to assess self-reported cravings. “That allowed us to ask people how much they’re craving in the moment — not yesterday, not last week,” said Patricia Grigson, director of the Penn State Addiction Center for Translation and the trial’s other PI.This clinical trial is the culmination of seven years of animal studies in Grigson’s lab, showing that GLP-1s target three roads to relapse — environmental cues, stress, and the drug itself — as STAT has previously reported. While the FDA has approved three drugs for treating opioid addiction, a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health estimated that only 20% of patients received these medications in 2021.Beyond low uptake, these drugs are associated with significant relapse rates (around 50%), don’t work as well in patients who have used fentanyl, and, in the case of buprenorphine and methadone, are sometimes stigmatized as opioids replacing opioids. GLP-1s could thus be a promising alternative or, at the very least, an adjunct to existing treatments, Grigson and Bunce said.However, the small sample size, limited participant diversity, and relatively short trial means that “we have to be very cautious about interpreting these preliminary results,” said Heath Schmidt, a neuropharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with this study. An added limitation is that studying patients in a residential treatment facility might not be representative: “That’s very different than being at home or on the street, where you’re around a lot of cues that promote relapse and craving,” Schmidt added. Moreover, people in a treatment facility are likely a highly motivated subset of patients, more inclined toward treatment.But perhaps the most significant limitation of these data is the high dropout rate, which not only limits interpretation of the results but also highlights a potential barrier of using GLP-1s to treat drug addiction. “Nausea is one of the first withdrawal symptoms — and this patient population is severely anxious and fearful about withdrawal,” said Saxon. “So they could interpret nausea as ‘I’m getting into withdrawal, and I’ve got to get away from it, however I can.’ ”Despite these limitations, Christian Hendershot, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill psychologist who has been studying GLP-1s for alcohol use disorder and was not involved with the study, emphasized the importance of this data as a proof of concept and a stepping stone toward larger trials. “The reason these initial findings are nice is that they looked at this question in a really controlled environment,” said Hendershot. “We know that craving predicts relapses in many cases, so having established that reduction, the next question is whether drugs like liraglutide suppress craving and relapse in the natural environment.”Grigson and Bunce similarly emphasize the preliminary nature of their findings and the need for follow-up studies. They are planning a randomized controlled trial in 200 people on methadone or buprenorphine, half receiving semaglutide and half receiving placebo — across three outpatient sites in Pennsylvania, New York, and Maryland.“With one person dying every five minutes and people dying around the world due to opioid exposure, we feel a sense of urgency,” Grigson said. “I feel very hopeful; there may be a new treatment for opioid use disorder.”Clarification: Participants using liraglutide experienced a 40% reduction in opioid cravings in the study (as the researchers showed in a slide), not 30% reduction (as stated in the presentation).STAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

A new device let a man sense temperature with his prosthetic hand,"A new device let a man sense temperature with his prosthetic hand  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Ability to differentiate between cold, cool and hot objects advances efforts to restore touchA sensor on the index finger of a man’s prosthetic hand connects to a spot on his arm that stimulates nerves once destined for the missing limb. The device made it possible for him to ace a sorting task: separate as many stainless steel blocks that are either cold (20° Celsius) or hot (40° C) as he could in one minute.Jamani Caillet/EPFLBy Simon MakinFebruary 9, 2024 at 11:00 amA new device makes it possible for a person with an amputation to sense temperature with a prosthetic hand. The technology is a step toward prosthetic limbs that restore a full range of senses, improving both their usefulness and acceptance by those who wear them.  A team of researchers in Italy and Switzerland attached the device, called ”MiniTouch,” to the prosthetic hand of a 57-year-old man named Fabrizio, who has an above-the-wrist amputation. In tests, the man could identify cold, cool and hot bottles of liquid with perfect accuracy; tell the difference between plastic, glass and copper significantly better than chance; and sort steel blocks by temperature with around 75 percent accuracy, researchers report February 9 in Med.“It’s important to incorporate these technologies in a way that prosthesis users can actually use to perform functional tasks,” says neuroengineer Luke Osborn of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., who was not involved in the study. “Introducing new sensory feedback modalities could help give users more functionality they weren’t able to achieve before.”The device also improved Fabrizio’s ability to tell whether he was touching an artificial or human arm. His accuracy was 80 percent with the device turned on, compared with 60 percent with it off. “It’s not quite as good as with the intact hand, probably because we’re not giving [information about] skin textures,” says neuroengineer Solaiman Shokur of EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.Work to restore a sense of touch to prosthetic limbs has advanced greatly over the past decade (SN: 9/9/19). But the ability to detect temperature has lagged behind. “Temperature is almost the last modality that needs to be solved in order to then put all the results together and be able to make an artificial limb really feel as the biological one,” says EPFL engineer Jonathan Muheim.The study builds on work the group published last May, which found that people who have had amputations often have spots on their residual limbs that, when heated or cooled, generate temperature sensations in their missing hand. It’s caused by stimulating nerves originally destined for the missing hand. The researchers showed they could reliably elicit phantom temperature sensations over time in 63 percent of amputees.In the new study, Shokur, Muheim and colleagues first mapped Fabrizio’s phantom temperature sensations to match a spot on his arm to the corresponding sensation in the index finger of his missing hand. They then attached a temperature sensor to the fingertip of his prosthetic hand, which was connected via a controller unit to a device on Fabrizio’s arm that delivered appropriate temperature signals.Currently the device employs only one sensor at the end of the index finger, but the team plans to add sensor-stimulator pairs to create more temperature-sensitive locations on the prosthetic hand. They are also planning to develop a prosthesis that combines the ability to sense touch as well as temperature. “In the coming year or so, hopefully that’s where we’ll be,” says Shokur.The speed at which the device relays temperature may become an issue when combining multiple senses. Osborn and colleagues have developed a device as thin as a Band-Aid that delivers realistic cooling sensations nearly as quickly as natural responses, that team reported in Nature Biomedical Engineering last July. In the immediate term, the new device needs to be tested in larger groups of participants, as well as real world settings, to ensure it isn’t adversely affected by high air temperatures or humidity. “We still need to do those crash tests outside the lab,” says Shokur.Once it leaves the lab, Fabrizio already knows how he’d put it to use. “With these new technologies, I can understand better what I am touching,” Fabrizio said in a prerecorded video interview. “Certainly, my priority would be to use it in a kitchen to cook.”Questions or comments on this article?

Evolutionary virologist Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks out ancient pathogens,"Evolutionary virologist Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks out ancient pathogens  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	He has reconstructed two viruses brought to the Americas during European colonizationDaniel Blanco-Melo’s obsession with viruses bloomed in high school. Today he studies how they’ve shaped human evolution and history.Courtesy of D. Blanco-MeloBy Pratik PawarNovember 14, 2023 at 9:00 amSmallpox, measles, mumps. These are among the contagious diseases that European colonists likely brought to the Americas at the turn of the 16th century, prompting the collapse of Indigenous populations. But the exact viruses that caused the millions of deaths remain unknown.Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks to solve that historical puzzle. An evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, he uses cutting-edge tools to study ancient viruses and illuminate how they have shaped human evolution and history. In recent work, Blanco-Melo and colleagues reconstructed two viruses circulating in Mexico at the time of European colonization.“Our research on ancient viruses is really appealing to the curiosity of the people and how we can study history,” Blanco-Melo says. But this work also holds personal meaning for Blanco-Melo as someone who was born and raised in Mexico. Through genetic sleuthing, he is able to study “something that is very dear in my heart,” he says, “really understanding, with molecular biology, those historical events.”Blanco-Melo’s obsession with viruses bloomed in high school when he had a chance encounter with Matt Ridley’s book Genome. Blanco-Melo had bought it as a Father’s Day gift for his dad but ended up reading it himself. Later, with encouragement from his biology teacher, he enrolled in an undergraduate program in genomics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, campus in Cuernavaca.He had his first encounter with ancient viruses as a Ph.D. student at the Rockefeller University in New York City. His research focused on particular viruses called endogenous retroviruses, remnants of past infectious viruses that have become integrated into a host’s genetic instruction book.Blanco-Melo first cataloged the genetic remains left behind by an ancient retrovirus called HERV-T that spread among our primate ancestors tens of millions of years ago. Further analysis revealed that a gene responsible for producing the virus’s outer envelope stuck around throughout primate history; even modern humans retain an inactive version. This gene encodes the envelope protein that helps the virus enter and infect a cell by interacting with another protein on the cell surface.Why would such a viral gene be so well preserved, Blanco-Melo wondered. What kind of evolutionary advantage could it have offered? Based on studies of cells in a lab dish, he hypothesizes that ancient primates must have co-opted the viral gene and used the related protein to get rid of the cell surface protein, essentially blocking the virus’s entry into cells.This example highlights how a virus’s own genetic material, over the course of evolution, can be used against it. “This project not only satisfied my curiosity, but we were able to push it into a full-blown story of how a virus evolved, emerged, but also how that virus ceased to exist,” Blanco-Melo says.Perhaps today’s researchers can exploit similar strategies to combat current retroviruses — “the big goal being HIV,” Blanco-Melo says.More recently, Blanco-Melo has teamed up with María Ávila-Arcos, an evolutionary geneticist at UNAM and an old friend, to study viral epidemics that largely wiped out Indigenous populations in the Americas.Blanco-Melo, Ávila-Arcos and a team of researchers extracted and isolated viral DNA from skeletal remains that they dated to somewhere between the 15th and 17th centuries. These remains come from mass graves at a colonial hospital and a chapel in what is now Mexico City. Archaeological and hospital autopsy records suggest that the remains in the graves belonged to Indigenous people and enslaved Africans who were victims of epidemics that occurred during the 1540s and 1570s.Based on those findings, the team reconstructed the genetic instruction books of two viruses not previously known to be circulating at that time — human parvovirus B19 and a human hepatitis B virus.The study, published in 2021 in the journal eLife, is perhaps the first to obtain ancient viral sequences from the Americas, says Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutch who wasn’t involved in this work.“Knowing about the ancient viruses that were infecting people hundreds of years ago is of great scientific and historical interest throughout the world, but especially of interest in the Americas,” Bloom says.The team found that the ancient viruses were similar to contemporary African strains. They “seem to have arrived in Mexico shortly after the European arrival,” Blanco-Melo says, “but they did not come from Europe. They came from Africa, basically through the transatlantic slave trade.”Through the collaboration, Blanco-Melo has been careful to avoid helicopter research, where outsiders come to a place, get the data and take credit for the resulting work. “These samples should stay in Mexico, should be analyzed by Mexican researchers … and all those results are, of course, going to be communicated back into the communities. That’s our goal,” he says.Though the two viruses the team identified aren’t likely to have caused massive epidemics, they could have exacerbated some of the symptoms of other diseases. Ongoing projects based on the same samples from Mexico are looking for other viruses and even peptides to get a fuller picture of the viruses from that time — and perhaps pin down big culprits. “There’s a lot more research that needs to be done in order to capture those other causative agents,” Blanco-Melo says.Questions or comments on this article?

Newly identified stem cells can lure breast cancer to the spine,"Newly identified stem cells can lure breast cancer to the spine  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Stem cells in the vertebrae secrete a protein that acts as a tumor attractorScientists have discovered a new type of stem cell that forms spinal tissue (in mice, these stem cells and the cells they produce are shown in green).J. Sun et al./Nature 2023By Meghan RosenOctober 13, 2023 at 11:00 amWhen breast cancer spreads, it often targets the spine. Now scientists may have finally discovered why.A newfound kind of stem cell drives cancer cells to bones in the vertebrae, pathologist Matthew Greenblatt of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and his colleagues report September 13 in Nature. The find helps explain a long-standing mystery of metastasis: why some cancers break away from their site of origin, journey through the bloodstream and take up residence in the backbone.“This is a major advance in our understanding of bone metastasis,” says Xiang Zhang, a cancer biologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not involved with the new study.In people with metastatic breast cancer, some 70 percent experience subsequent bone cancer. And of the bones in the skeleton, cancer cells preferentially seek out vertebrae. For these patients, “spine metastases are one of the most common complications,” Greenblatt says, “and one of the most dreaded.” Tumors that take root in the spine can crush the spinal cord, which houses nerve bundles crucial for body sensation and movement. Such damage can hamper people’s ability to walk and control their bladder and bowels, and shorten their life spans.Doctors have known for decades that some cancers preferentially seek out the spine, Greenblatt says, but no one has had a good explanation for why. One idea proposed in 1940, that actions like coughing jolt blood off course and somehow send cancerous cells to the vertebrae, still hangs on today. It’s what Greenblatt learned when he was a medical student. But for him and his team, “that didn’t make sense to us scientifically.”What did end up making sense was stem cells. The researchers had a hunch that stem cells inside vertebral bones differed from those in other sites in the skeleton, like the long bones in the arms and legs. In the lab, that’s just what they found. Greenblatt’s team pulled out a population of stem cells from mice vertebrae distinctly unlike ones collected from long bones. These new stem cells switched on a separate set of genes and behaved differently in experiments, the researchers found.Until now, scientists didn’t know that these two types of bones held distinct populations of stem cells. “We assumed they were the same,” says Geert Carmeliet, a cell and molecular endocrinologist at KU Leuven in Belgium who was not involved with the work, but wrote an accompanying commentary. The team’s discovery raised the possibility that spinal stem cells might play a role in spinal disease.In one key experiment, Greenblatt’s team transplanted spinal stem cells into one hind leg of mice and long bone stem cells into the other. Each transplant formed miniature bones, or organoids, in the animals’ bodies — a tiny vertebra on the right, for example, and a bit of long bone on the left. Then, the researchers injected breast cancer cells into the mice and watched where they ended up.The cells traveled to the mini vertebra nearly twice as often as they did to the little long bone, as if lured by a cancer-calling Pied Piper. It’s an elegant way to show that “tumor cells preferentially come to the [vertebra] organoid and not to the organoid of the long bone,” Carmeliet says.The newly identified spinal stem cells, found in both mice and humans, secrete a protein called MFGE8 that acts as a tumor attractant, the team discovered, drawing cancer cells to spinal tissue. The protein may not be the only factor involved, Greenblatt says, “but it’s an important one in driving tumor cells to the spine.”It’s possible that blocking MFGE8 could prevent or treat spine metastasis. “I think it’s definitely worth further investigation,” Zhang says. But, he notes, it’s still too early to know what the therapeutic implications may be.Greenblatt’s team is now exploring whether the new stem cells can recruit other types of tumor cells to the spine. When prostate cancer spreads, for example, it also tends to travel to vertebrae over other types of bone. He and his colleagues are also curious whether our bones may be hiding anything else. “We’re starting to think about what other stem cells may be left to discover in the skeleton.”Questions or comments on this article?

Paired with the discovery that inflammation in the skull is disease-specific, these new findings collectively suggest the skull’s marrow could serve as a target to track and potentially treat neurological disorders involving brain inflammation, researchers report August 9 in Cell.Immune cells that infiltrate the central nervous system during many diseases and neuronal injury can wreak havoc by flooding the brain with damaging molecules. This influx of immune cells causes inflammation in the brain and spinal cord and can contribute to diseases like multiple sclerosis (SN: 11/26/19). Detecting and dampening this reaction has been an extensive field of research.With this new work, the skull, “something that has been considered as just protective, suddenly becomes a very active site of interaction with the brain, not only responding to brain diseases, but also changing itself in response to brain diseases,” says Gerd Meyer zu Hörste, a neurologist at University of Münster in Germany who was not involved in the study.Ali Ertürk of the Helmholtz Center in Munich and colleagues discovered this potential role for the skull while probing the idea that the cells in skull marrow might behave differently from those in other bones. Ertürk’s team compared the genetic activity of cells in mice skull marrow, and the proteins those cells made, with those in the rodent’s humerus, femur and four other bones, along with the meninges, the protective membranes between the skull and the brain.Cells in the skull, particularly a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, differed from those in other bones but were similar to those in the meninges, the team found. And brain injury widened those differences. In mice with stroke symptoms, the activity in skull cells of genes related to cell migration and inflammation was higher than in other bone cells, suggesting that the cells respond to whatever is happening in the brain.In another experiment, Ertürk and colleagues compared the profile of proteins in human skull cells with those in the pelvis or the vertebra. Skull marrow cells presented brain proteins while the other bones did not. “This tells us that the communication is two-way,” Ertürk says.Those discoveries seemed important, but only if the skull and brain had a way to send cells back and forth. A few years ago, researchers observed connecting “tunnels” between the skull and the meninges in mice and humans (SN: 8/31/18). More recently, another team showed that immune cells from the skull were actually getting into the brains of mice, an observation made again in the new study.To get a better look at the human tunnels, the team used a technique that makes tissue transparent, along with 3-D imaging, to inspect the bone and tissue of people who had died. That revealed a clear path to connect the skull and meninges, something “never been imaged in that much detail in humans before,” says Meyer zu Hörste.The study “shows the connections very beautifully,” he says, “but how functionally relevant they are still needs to be studied.”The team did track the location and levels of neuroinflammation in the skulls of people who have Alzheimer’s disease, stroke or multiple sclerosis using PET imaging. The pattern of skull inflammation was different with each disease. For example, in people with MS, there was a huge inflammation signal at the base of the skull, which was not present in people with stroke or Alzheimer’s.“The inflammatory signature was moving depending on the nature of the neurological disorder,” says Ilgin Kolabas, a neuroscientist in Ertürk’s lab. The signal even increased in specific regions in the skulls of people with Alzheimer’s, a possible sign of the progression of the disease.Because these signals might be mirroring what is happening in the brain, they could serve as a proxy for neuroinflammation, Kolabas says. The team anticipates these findings could help with both diagnosis and treatment of stroke, Alzheimer’s and other neurological disorders using less invasive methods than spinal taps or other alternatives.But the technology is still not sufficiently advanced for that yet; future studies need to address whether skull inflammation can actually be measured and targeted to attack brain diseases, Meyer zu Hörste says. “There is a lot of work left to be done.”Questions or comments on this article?

A new device can detect the coronavirus in the air in minutes,"A new device can detect the coronavirus in the air in minutes  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	The detector is about as sensitive as a PCR test but quickerA coronavirus detector (illustrated in a 3-D rendering of a proposed final design) can sense airborne SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in just five minutes.Joseph Puthussery/Washington Univ. in St. LouisBy Tina Hesman SaeyJuly 16, 2023 at 7:00 amIf you’ve ever thought it would be great to walk into a room and know whether the virus that causes COVID-19 is hanging around, scientists have a device for you. Researchers have created a machine a little bigger than a toaster that can detect airborne SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in minutes.It takes only five minutes to detect as few as seven to 35 viral particles per liter of air, researchers report July 10 in Nature Communications. That is about as sensitive as PCR nasal swab tests, says Rajan Chakrabarty, an aerosol scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. His team worked “nonstop” for three years to create the detector, he says.One of the main challenges when sampling airborne viruses is collecting enough air to concentrate viral particles at detectable levels. Previous attempts have sucked in between 2 and 8 cubic meters of air per minute. This detector pulls in 1,000 cubic meters of air each minute.To trap the virus, “we create an artificial cyclone inside of the sampler,” Chakrabarty says, by swirling liquid at high speed. Viruses get trapped in the wall of the cyclone and concentrated for analysis. Any viruses not captured in the liquid get filtered out of the air with a HEPA filter attached to the device. After five minutes of collection, the liquid is pumped to a biosensor.The biosensor consists of an electrode attached to a llama nanobody, a specialized immune system protein made by llamas and their relatives that fights infections much the way antibodies do but is smaller and perhaps tougher than human antibodies (SN: 9/14/20). The nanobody grabs any passing coronavirus by its spike protein. Electricity passing through the nanobody and spike protein causes tyrosine amino acids in the spike protein to oxidize, or lose electrons. Another device attached to the electrode detects that oxidation as a change in voltage, signaling that SARS-CoV-2 is in the air.  The biosensor is based on a detector for the amyloid-beta protein fragments that form Alzheimer’s disease plaques developed by Chakrabarty’s colleagues Carla Yuede and John Cirrito. To test the detector, the researchers sent the device to the apartments of two people who had COVID-19 infections. “The device was detecting even the trace amounts of virus being shed by the patients,” Chakrabarty says. Air collected from an empty, well-ventilated conference room showed no sign of the virus.“They’ve demonstrated that it works. It’s able to detect [the] virus at low levels that we would be concerned about in the air,” says Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who studies the spread of viruses. She was not involved in the study but is working on a detector, too.There are still some challenges to overcome. For instance, the device is about as noisy as a vacuum cleaner or a ringing phone. That’s probably too loud to use continuously in a classroom or office, Marr says, but could be tolerated if run for 10 minutes.Such detectors cost about $1,400 to $1,900 to build in a research lab, Chakrabarty says. Commercial versions may initially be too expensive for home use, Marr says, but could be used in hospitals, airports and other public areas to survey for the virus. The devices could be linked into HVAC systems, which could ramp up ventilation and filtration if the virus is found, Marr and Chakrabarty suggest.In the future, Chakrabarty hopes to add llama nanobodies that can detect other respiratory viruses as well, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus.Questions or comments on this article?

The first gene therapy for muscular dystrophy has been approved for some kids,"U.S. Food and Drug AdministrationFDA Approves First Gene Therapy for Treatment of Certain Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  The .gov means it’s official.Federal government websites often end in .gov or .mil. Before sharing sensitive information, make sure you're on a federal government site.The site is secure. The https:// ensures that you are connecting to the official website and that any information you provide is encrypted and transmitted securely.FDA News Release EspañolToday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Elevidys, the first gene therapy for the treatment of pediatric patients 4 through 5 years of age with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene who do not have a pre-existing medical reason preventing treatment with this therapy. “Today’s approval addresses an urgent unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a devastating condition with limited treatment options, that leads to a progressive deterioration of an individual’s health over time,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “The FDA remains committed to facilitating the development of innovative new therapies to reduce the impact of debilitating diseases and to improve outcomes and quality of life for those affected.”Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare and serious genetic condition which worsens over time, leading to weakness and wasting away of the body’s muscles. The disease occurs due to a defective gene that results in absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep the body’s muscle cells intact. As a result of this genetic defect, individuals with DMD may have symptoms such as trouble walking and running, falling frequently, fatigue, learning disabilities/difficulties, heart issues as a result of impact on heart muscle functioning, and breathing problems due to weakening of respiratory muscles involved in lung function. Symptoms of muscle weakness associated with DMD typically begin in childhood, often between 3 to 6 years of age. DMD mainly affects males and in rare cases may affect females. About one in every 3,300 boys are affected by this disorder. As the disease progresses, life-threatening heart and respiratory problems can occur. Although disease severity and life expectancy vary, patients often succumb to the disease in their 20s or 30s because of heart and/or respiratory failure. Most current treatment approaches address the symptoms of the disease, but not its underlying genetic cause. Treatments include corticosteroid medications to slow down the progression of muscle weakness, stretching and exercise programs, and use of equipment such as braces or a wheelchair as walking becomes more difficult. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) facilitate exon skipping for specific DMD gene mutations, but the ASOs can only address a minority of the gene mutations and require repeated administration.  Elevidys is a recombinant gene therapy designed to deliver into the body a gene that leads to production of Elevidys micro-dystrophin, a shortened protein (138 kDa, compared to the 427 kDa dystrophin protein of normal muscle cells) that contains selected domains of the dystrophin protein present in normal muscle cells. The product is administered as a single intravenous dose. Elevidys was approved through the Accelerated Approval pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases where there is an unmet medical need and the drug is shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to patients (improving how patients feel or function, or whether they survive longer), or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. This pathway generally provides patients earlier access to promising new drugs while the company conducts clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit.The FDA granted approval based on an evaluation of data submitted by the sponsor. In one study which involved two parts, individuals in part 1—which was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled—were treated with either Elevidys or placebo and followed for 48 weeks. In part 2 of the study, individuals who received placebo during part 1 were treated with Elevidys, and individuals treated with Elevidys during part 1 received a placebo. All individuals were followed for an additional 48 weeks. The accelerated approval of Elevidys was based on data from the randomized clinical trial that established that Elevidys increased the expression of the Elevidys micro-dystrophin protein observed in Elevidys-treated individuals aged 4 to 5 years with DMD. The FDA concluded that the data submitted by the applicant demonstrated that an increase in this surrogate endpoint (expression of Elevidys micro-dystrophin) is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in individuals 4 to 5 years of age with DMD who do not have significant pre-existing antibody titers against the AAV rh74 vector or have other contraindications based on the inclusion criteria of the clinical trials. In making this decision, the FDA considered the potential risks associated with the drug, the life-threatening and debilitating nature of the disease for these children, and the urgent unmet medical need. A clinical benefit of Elevidys, including improved motor function, has not been established. As a condition of approval, the FDA is requiring the company to complete a clinical study to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit. The required study is designed to assess whether Elevidys improves physical function and mobility in ambulatory DMD patients with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene. The study is ongoing and fully enrolled. The agency will review the data from this trial as quickly as possible to consider if further action, such as a revised indication or withdrawal of Elevidys, may be necessary.The most commonly reported side effects by individuals who received Elevidys were vomiting, nausea, acute liver injury, pyrexia (fever) and thrombocytopenia (abnormally low platelet count in the blood). Patients’ liver function should be monitored before treatment with Elevidys, and weekly for the first three months after treatment. Patients given Elevidys may also be at risk for severe immune-mediated myositis (muscle inflammation). Additionally, myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle) and elevations of troponin-I (a heart protein found in the blood after heart muscle injury) have been observed following use of Elevidys in clinical trials. Troponin-I levels should be monitored before administration of Elevidys and weekly for the first month after treatment. The FDA granted accelerated approval of Elevidys to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.###The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Deblina Sarkar is building microscopic machines to enter our brains,"Deblina Sarkar is building microscopic machines to enter our brains  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	She dreams of using the ultratiny devices to cure brain diseasesDeblina Sarkar wants to develop miniature machines that may one day help treat Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological afflictions.Jimmy Day, MIT Media LabBy Nikk OgasaMay 23, 2023 at 8:00 amDeblina Sarkar makes little machines, for which she has big dreams. The machines are so little, in fact, that they can humbly inhabit living cells. And her dreams are so big, they may one day save your mind.Sarkar is a nanotechnologist and assistant professor at MIT. She develops ultratiny electronic devices, some smaller than a mote of dust, that she hopes will one day enter the brain. She’s also a fan of Kung Fu movies and likes to dance her own twist on bharata natyam, a classical Indian dance form. Occasionally she goes hiking with her graduate students, once taking them as far as Yellowstone. Building camaraderie is vital, Sarkar says. But “I’m probably working day and night on my research,” she confesses. “There is an urgent problem at hand.”That problem is Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological afflictions that assault the minds of millions of people worldwide. Sarkar’s solution: Employ minute machines to detect and reverse these disorders.“She was always interested in applying … electronics to biological systems,” says collaborator and bioengineering researcher Samir Mitragotri of Harvard University, who has known Sarkar for about a decade and was on her thesis committee. She envisions using her tools to “transform how people are conducting biology,” he says, “bridging the worlds.”Born in Kolkata, India, Sarkar credits both of her parents as early inspirations. Her boldness as a researcher comes from her mother, who as a young woman defied social norms in her village by working to fund her own education and speaking out against the dowry system. Meanwhile, Sarkar’s father sparked her fascination for engineering.At the age of 15, he abandoned his dreams of becoming an engineer to find other jobs; he needed to support his parents and the rest of his family after his father, an Indian freedom fighter, was shot in the leg and could no longer work. Still, Sarkar recalls her father finding time for his passion, fashioning devices to make home life more convenient. These included an electricity-free washing machine and vehicles that could freight hefty loads down local byroads to their house.“That got me very, very interested in science and technology,” Sarkar says. “Engineering specifically.”After earning a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Dhanbad, Sarkar moved to California to study nanoelectronics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. There, she tested new ways to create nanodevices that could reduce the amount of power consumed by computers and other everyday electronics.One standout device Sarkar developed during her graduate work was a transistor that reduced the amount of power lost as heat by 90 percent compared with some of today’s most common silicon transistors (SN: 3/18/22). For the breakthrough, UC Santa Barbara awarded Sarkar’s Ph.D. dissertation the Lancaster Award for its impact in advancing math, physical sciences and engineering.Along the way, Sarkar became fascinated with the brain, which she calls “the lowest energy computer.” A project imaging amyloid-beta plaques as a postdoc at MIT opened the door to fusing her dual interests, and she stayed on as an assistant professor to found the Nano-Cybernetic Biotrek group. Her group develops nanodevices that can interface with living cells, and “neuromorphic” computing devices, which have architectures inspired by the human brain and nervous system.  So far, the group’s most innovative device may be the Cell Rover, a flat antenna that could monitor processes inside cells. For a study reported in 2022, Sarkar and her colleagues used magnetic fields to finesse a Cell Rover, roughly the size of a tardigrade, into a mature frog egg cell. The team demonstrated that when stimulated by a magnetic field created by an alternating current, molecules in the nanodevice vibrated at frequencies safe for living cells. Using a wire coil receiver, the researchers were able to detect how those vibrations affected the device’s own magnetic field, thus showing it could communicate with the outside world. Cell Rovers could be outfitted with films that latch onto and detect select proteins or other biomolecules.Sarkar envisions using the device to spot misfolded proteins in the brain that may be early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Today, memory loss is the only way to know a living person has Alzheimer’s, but by then, the damage is irreversible, Sarkar says. Cell Rovers could also be paired with nanodevices that harvest energy from and electrically stimulate cells, opening the door for new types of brain electrodes and subcellular pacemakers. Or fleets of remotely controlled devices could replace invasive surgeries — detecting a small tumor growing in the brain, for example, and maybe even killing it.She’s essentially establishing a new field of science, at the intersection of nanoelectronics and biology, Mitragotri says. “There are many opportunities for the future.”One day, Sarkar hopes to insert nanodevices between human neurons to boost the computing speed of the fleshy processor already in our skulls. Our brains are remarkable, she says, but “we could be better than what we are.”Deblina Sarkar is one of this year’s SN 10: Scientists to Watch, our list of 10 early and mid-career scientists who are making extraordinary contributions to their field.

Scientists may have found an antidote for death cap mushrooms,"Scientists may have found an antidote for death cap mushrooms  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Indocyanine green dye stopped a toxin from killing human cells and mice in lab testsIngesting a death cap mushroom can result in kidney and liver damage, and even death. A dye used in some medical procedures seems to counteract the fungi’s most lethal toxin, lab tests show.syaber/iStock/Getty Images PlusBy Tina Hesman SaeyMay 16, 2023 at 11:00 amDeath cap mushrooms get their name for a reason: The poisonous fungi can kill if ingested in even small amounts. But researchers may have found an antidote for one of the mushroom’s most deadly toxins.A dye already used in medical procedures can block damage from the mushroom’s alpha-amanitin toxin, researchers report May 16 in Nature Communications. The work was done with human cells grown in lab dishes and with mice. If the finding holds up in trials with people, the antidote has potential to save lives.Death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are responsible for the majority of deaths from mushroom poisonings worldwide. Symptoms may appear as soon as six hours after ingestion and include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. If a person isn’t treated immediately, the toxins can cause liver and kidney damage that can lead to death within 48 hours after ingestion. There is no antidote currently available, but people can be treated with fluids, activated charcoal and other therapies.How alpha-amanitin kills isn’t fully understood. A team of researchers in China and Australia used the gene editor CRISPR/Cas9 to determine which human genes the toxin triggers to cause cell damage and death (SN: 10/7/20). One of those genes makes a protein called STT3B, which helps attach sugars to proteins. Scientists hadn’t known that that process was important for mushroom toxicity.The team then screened a library of more than 3,000 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for molecules that could inhibit STT3B’s action. The team found that the dye indocyanine green could stop the protein from doing its job and prevent human cells in lab dishes from dying after being treated with alpha-amanitin.In tests with mice poisoned with alpha-amanitin, the dye reduced liver and kidney damage and increased survival rates if given one to four hours after poisoning. Waiting eight to 12 hours to administer the antidote reduced its effectiveness, the team found, probably because irreversible organ damage had already occurred.Questions or comments on this article?

A successful demonstration on a minipig suggests the device could be a less invasive way to place sensors directly on the brain, which currently can require removal of a large section of skull.The device is known as a soft robot: soft, because unlike traditional mechanical devices, it’s made of flexible materials, and robot, because its sensory apparatus moves, opening like a flower once implanted (SN: 3/3/21).“Of all the soft robotics that I’ve seen, it’s kind of the one that you say, ‘Wow, this is really going to change, potentially, the way we do things in neurosurgery,’” says Joseph Madsen, a neurosurgeon at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study. “The idea of a robot that kind of internally unfolds and goes over the brain is just very elegant.”The robotic device consists of a central hub surrounded by six flat, petal-shaped sensors made of a soft, flexible material. At first, the petals are inverted into the hub. “It’s a bit like a glove where … you flip it outside in,” says Stéphanie Lacour, a bioengineer at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Geneva.Once inside the skull, a flow of saline solution through the hub gently forces the petals open, where they then lay flat against the surface of the cerebral cortex. Sensors in each petal signal when they’re in place and then start monitoring the brain, sending information back to a monitor via electrical wires.Lacour and colleagues tested a prototype in the brain of a minipig, successfully deploying the roughly daisy-sized sensor array inside the skull and recording electrical activity. The technology could be sized up to cover a larger area for human use, Lacour says. Future versions could be bidirectional, she says, not only sensing brain activity but also stimulating it. That might allow the device to stop seizure activity before it begins, stimulate brain areas damaged by stroke or act as a brain-machine interface to allow people to control devices (SN: 2/11/21).The researchers have created a company to further develop the technology and conduct the additional testing that will be required to gain approval for use in human patients.Questions or comments on this article?

Paris 2024 Olympics: Leon Marchand makes history with golden double,"Paris 2024 Olympics: Leon Marchand makes history with golden double   Subscribers Only Have you subscribed yet?Buy Print Published : Aug 01, 2024 11:19 IST , PARIS - 3 MINS READ  Comments Follow UsSHAREREAD LATER Paris 2024 Olympics: France’s Leon Marchand celebrates after winning men’s 200-meter breaststroke gold medal in Nanterre on Wednesday.   Photo Credit: AP France’s Paris Games poster boy Leon Marchand went where no swimmer has gone before by winning the 200 metres breaststroke and butterfly golds on the same night - and both in Olympic record times - at his home Olympics on Wednesday.The breaststroke gold was his third at the La Defense Arena but the 22-year-old rewrote the script on what was previously thought impossible by becoming the first to medal in both of the demanding disciplines.Even US great Michael Phelps, whose coach Bob Bowman now works with the Frenchman, did not achieve that with his mighty wingspan.With the crowd chanting his name at every stroke -- “Leon, Leon” echoing around the rafters -- Marchand led every metre of the breaststroke before touching out in two minutes 05.85 seconds.The world record, set by China’s Qin Haiyang last year, stands at 2:05.48 and Marchand was set to beat that up to the 150 metre mark.READ   Sjostrom turns back the clock to win 100m freestyle goldAustralia’s Zac Stubblety-Cook, the 2021 champion in Tokyo, had to settle for silver while Caspar Corbeau of the Netherlands took the bronze.“It was pretty crazy to have the chance to be in the final in both races,” said Marchand. “And then I just loved it, it was huge.“I’ve fulfilled a lot of dreams since I’ve been here. Doing this double was also something I felt capable of, but to really do it in the real world is something else.”The youngster, who lit the touchpaper when he won the Individual Medley on Sunday, sent sound levels off the scale from the moment he stepped onto the pool deck.In the butterfly race he beat Hungary’s world record holder and reigning champion Kristof Milak into second place, with Canada’s Ilya Kharun finishing third.Unlike in the later breaststroke, Marchand was behind until the final length when he overpowered Milak and surged past to win.He returned for the podium ceremony, saluting the cheering crowd as the “Marseillaise” national anthem sounded, and then made a quick exit.Such was the sense of anticipation ahead of the later event that the poolside volunteers removing the athletes’ clothing boxes left more hurriedly than usual, sprinting even, to catch the race on television.All over town crowds waited and watched history unfold, the bars spilling over.Spectators at the table tennis venue broke into the anthem after Marchand’s first gold of the night.To win both titles was a simply astonishing achievement. To do it at a single Games even more remarkable. To take double gold on the same night, with a medal ceremony in between, truly the stuff of fiction.“I had a lot of doubts, because everyone was telling me it wasn’t possible,” said Marchand.“I had the shivers all through the race, and at the end I really tried not to breathe, to hit the wall as quickly as possible, and then I see I’m first, it was a pretty crazy emotion,” he said“I really enjoyed every moment of these two finals. It was really amazing for me to swim both. I’m really proud of everything.” Comments  Swimming  /  Leon Marchand  /  Paris 2024 Olympics  /  Michael Phelps BACK TO TOPTerms & conditions     Institutional SubscriberComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

India led 4-2 after the third series and extended their lead to 8-2 after the fifth. Although South Korea narrowed the gap to 10-6 after the eighth series, the Indian duo maintained their composure to secure a comfortable victory.This marks Sarabjot’s first Olympic medal. Manu, meanwhile, became the first Indian to win multiple medals at a single Olympic Games, having already opened India’s account at the 2024 Paris Olympics with a bronze in the women’s 10m air pistol event. Bhaker also became only the fourth Indian after Norman Pritchard (athletics), Sushil Kumar (wrestling) and PV Sindhu (badminton) to win multiple medals for India at a Summer Games. However, no Indian has won multiple medals at a single edition - until Bhaker at Paris 2024.Paris Olympics 2024: India Schedule   Full Coverage   Medal TallyIn the 10m Air Pistol mixed team qualification, Manu and Sarabjot finished third with 580 points and 20 perfect shots.

Angela Carini abandons Olympic fight after 46 seconds against Imane Khelif,"Angela Carini abandons Olympic fight after 46 seconds against Imane Khelif  The Italian boxer Angela Carini broke down in tears after she abandoned her bout against the Algerian Imane Khelif after 46 seconds in a fight that sparked huge controversy at the Olympics.Khelif is one of two boxers permitted to fight at the Olympics despite being disqualified from the women’s world championships last year for failing gender eligibility tests.In highly charged scenes at the North Paris Arena, a first punch from Khelif dislodged Carini’s chinstrap and a second smashed against her chin and bloodied her shorts. After multiple punches Carini returned to her corner and raised her hand. She fell to her knees sobbing and refused to shake Khelif’s hand after the Algerian was declared the winner.Carini said she had pulled out after being hit harder than she had ever been hit and feared her nose was broken. “I am heartbroken,” Carini said. “I went to the ring to honour my father. I was told a lot of times that I was a warrior but I preferred to stop for my health. I have never felt a punch like this.”The 25-year-old, from Naples, added: “I got into the ring to fight. I didn’t give up, but one punch hurt too much and so I said enough. I’m going out with my head held high.“After the second punch, after years of experience, I felt a strong pain in the nose. I said enough, because I didn’t want. I couldn’t finish the fight after the punch to the nose. So it was better to put an end to it.“I am in pieces because I am a fighter, they taught me to be a warrior. I have always tried to behave with honour, I have always represented my country with loyalty. This time I didn’t manage to because I couldn’t fight any more. Regardless of the person I had in front, of me, which doesn’t interest me, regardless of all the row, I just wanted to win. I wanted to face the person that I had in front of me and to fight.”Asked if it would have been better to pull out beforehand, Carini said: “I am not one that gives in easily. No, even if they had said that we wouldn’t fight, I would never have accepted it. I have a warrior’s mentality. This time I didn’t manage. I felt too much pain on my nose. I said enough.“It’s not a defeat for me – for me if you go in the ring you have already won, regardless of everything else. I’m not here to judge. It’s not up to me to say if it’s fair or not fair. I just did my job. I managed to leave with my head held high. I’m a mature woman; when I feel I cannot continue, its not giving in, it’s having the dignity to say enough. I was convinced I would win, I was concentrated, serene. But these punches to the nose hurt, I said enough.”Carini said it was “not up to me to judge” whether Khelif should have been barred from the competition. “I did my job.”Khelif stopped briefly to speak to the BBC: “I am here for gold,” the Algerian said. “I will fight anybody, I will fight them all.”Reem Alsalem, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, expressed her concern about what had happened. “Angela Carini rightly followed her instincts and prioritised her physical safety, but she and other female athletes should not have been exposed to this physical and psychological violence based on their sex,” she tweeted.Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, weighed in, saying: “I think that athletes who have male genetic characteristics should not be admitted to women’s competitions … from my point of view it was not an even contest.”Before the fight The International Olympic Committee (IOC) came under fire for permitting Khelif and Lin Yu‑ting of Taiwan to compete in the women’s category at these Games. Lin is due to face Uzbekistan’s Sitora Turdibekova in a featherweight bout in Paris on Friday.Last year both fighters were disqualified from the world championships, with the International Boxing Association (IBA) president, Umar Kremlev, saying that DNA tests had “proved they had XY chromosomes and were thus excluded”. XY is the combination of chromosomes in males, while XX is the combination in females, with exceptions where rare conditions are present.Sign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefingOur daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics after newsletter promotionBut last night the IOC issued a statement that confirmed that said both boxers had “complied” with its entry regulations and “have been competing in international boxing competitions for many years in the women’s category”.“As with previous Olympic boxing competitions, the gender and age of the athletes are based on their passport,” it added.The IOC also accused the IBA of changing its gender rules in the middle of the 2023 world championships. “The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure – especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years,” it said. “Such an approach is contrary to good governance.”However, concerns have been raised among the boxing and wider sporting community. On Wednesday Australia’s boxing captain Caitlin Parker expressed her fears that one of her teammates is fighting in the same 66kg weight category as Khelif. “I don’t agree with them being allowed to compete in sport, especially combat sports,” Parker said. “It can be incredibly dangerous.”Agence France-Presse reported that Khelif claimed to be the victim of a “big conspiracy” after being disqualified just before the final at last year’s world championships.The Algerian Olympic Committee (COA) said on Wednesday it “strongly condemns the unethical targeting and maligning of our esteemed athlete, Imane Khelif, with baseless propaganda “from certain foreign media outlets”, adding: “Such attacks on her personality and dignity are deeply unfair, especially as she prepares for the pinnacle of her career at the Olympics. The COA has taken all necessary measures to protect our champion.”Luca Anna Hamori, a Hungarian boxer who is due to face Khelif in the next round, said she was prepared. “I will go to the ring and I will get my win. I trust my coaches and I trust myself.” This article was amended on 14 August 2024 to reflect there are exceptions to XY and XX chromosome combinations where rare conditions are present.",True,True,True
Nadal drops retirement hint after exiting Olympic men’s doubles with Alcaraz,"Nadal drops retirement hint after exiting Olympic men’s doubles with Alcaraz  Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz’s dreams of an Olympic medal in the men’s doubles were ended by a quarter-final loss to the American fourth seeds Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram.The Spanish duo have been one of the star attractions of the tennis event at Roland Garros and another packed crowd cheered them on under the roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier. But they met their match as Krajicek and Ram, two of the best doubles players in the game, showed their prowess to claim a 6-2, 6-4 victory.Nadal has been tight-lipped about his future but this could be the 14-time French Open champion’s farewell to Paris. Afterwards he revealed he is unlikely to play the US Open, dropping the strongest hint yet that his career could soon be at an end.Asked whether he would head to the United States, where events building up to the US Open are already under way, the 38-year-old said: “It looks like not but I’m going to let you know soon. For me now, I can’t give you a clear answer, I need some time. But for me it looks difficult.”Answering a question about his relationship with Alcaraz, Nadal cast even more doubt on his future. “If my age will be 10 years less, we’re going to create a beautiful relationship on court and we’re going to share a lot of beautiful moments together,” he said.“But that’s not going to happen. We’ll see if I keep playing the normal tour. But of course I will be supporting him from home and wishing him all the very best every single time. Even if I keep playing or not, I love tennis.”Nadal has signed up for the Laver Cup in Berlin in September and, two years after Roger Federer bade farewell at the Ryder Cup-style event, there is a possibility his great rival may follow suit.“It was disappointing to not bring back a medal for Spain but that’s it,” said Nadal. “I tried my best in every single minute that I was on court, but it was not enough to achieve our goals. If that’s the last time, it’s an unforgettable feeling and emotions.”Alcaraz had earlier stayed on course for a gold-medal clash with Novak Djokovic in the men’s singles after both reached the quarter-finals.Djokovic faced Germany’s Dominik Koepfer and defied the hot and humid conditions to claim a 7-5, 6-3 victory. He is the first player in the modern era to reach the quarter-finals in singles at four different Olympics but he is yet to make a final and has only one bronze medal.“Bringing a medal to Serbia is always a big goal of mine; has been since my first Olympic Games in Beijing, where I managed to get my only medal so far,” said Djokovic. “I had actually some really good Olympic Games but that semi-final hurdle was, three out of four times, tough for me to go through.”Alcaraz, meanwhile, became the youngest man since Djokovic in 2008 to reach the last eight, beating Roman Safiullin 6-4, 6-2.Djokovic next faces eighth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas while Alcaraz will play American Tommy Paul in a rematch of their Wimbledon quarter-final. Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti, meanwhile, conjured up a repeat of his SW19 upset by knocking out the seventh seed, Taylor Fritz, 6-4, 7-5.Andy Murray may be clinging on but it was the end of the road for another retiring three-time grand slam title winner, with Angelique Kerber enduring a heartbreaking 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (6) defeat by China’s Zheng Qinwen in the women’s quarter-finals.Sign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefingOur daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics after newsletter promotionKerber’s run to the last eight in Paris was her best result this year. The 36-year-old had already announced she would retire following the Olympics, having returned from maternity leave in January.“I’ve achieved everything I dreamed of,” Kerber said. “I was No 1, won grand slams, won a silver medal in Rio, so what more could you want in the end? I’m proud of everything I’ve achieved in my career, of what I’ve achieved here, what I did on the court.”Zheng is now guaranteed a shot at a medal, as is Anna Karolina Schmiedlova, the most surprising success story here. The 29-year-old is ranked 67 but followed her upset of the Wimbledon finalist Jasmine Paolini by taking out the SW19 champion Barbora Krejcikova, 6-4, 6-2.The Slovakian’s run is causing quite a stir back home and she said: “I still can’t believe that I’m in the semi-finals and the top four players in the world. The best game of my life is for the Olympics and for my country and for people around me, so it’s a big deal. It’s amazing.”The top seeds Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula were knocked out of the doubles in the second round, the Americans losing 2-6, 6-4, 10-5 against the Czechs Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova, but there was better news for Britain’s Katie Boulter and Heather Watson.The Team GB pair were impressive 6-3, 6-4 winners against the No 6 seeds, Brazil’s Beatriz Haddad Maia and Luisa Stefani, and will face Italy’s No 3 seeds, Paolini and Sara Errani in the quarter-finals.",True,True,True

The Dutchman in the end finished second, behind first-time F1 winner Oscar Piastri for McLaren, with Lando Norris finishing third. After sealing the long-awaited title, the Dutchman becomes just the fifth man in the sport’s 73-year history to win three championships on the spin. He also becomes the first driver in 40 years to win the championship on a Saturday.Since winning the opening race in Bahrain, Verstappen has been borderline unstoppable. While Perez triumphed in Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan – either side of Verstappen winning in Australia – the Dutchman displayed a statement of intent by winning from ninth on the grid in Miami in May.From that moment on, the 26-year-old was indomitable, storming to a startling 10 victories on the spin, breaking Sebastian Vettel’s record of nine consecutive victories from 2013.Highlights include a terrific pole-snatching qualifying session in Monaco, denying Fernando Alonso, as well as impressive drives to first in Montreal, Austria and Budapest. He also tasted victory at July’s British Grand Prix at Silverstone – a race he had not previously won.And while his win streak ended surprisingly with a weekend to forget in Singapore last month, Verstappen soon returned to form a week later with a simple lights-to-flag win in Japan.Now, Verstappen will be eyeing four titles on the spin and the omens look good: out of the four drivers (Juan Manuel Fangio, Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton) to have won three in a row, all have gone on to make it four on the spin.This year, too, he can break his own record for most wins in a single season, set last year at 15.

Carlos Sainz signs two-year F1 deal to drive for Williams from 2025,"Carlos Sainz signs two-year F1 deal to drive for Williams from 2025  Carlos Sainz said an “exceptionally complex” Formula One driver market delayed his decision to sign a two-year deal with Williams from next season. The Spaniard will leave Ferrari at the end of 2024 after the seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton was announced as his replacement earlier in the year.Sainz has won three F1 races in his career to date, the latest of which came at the Australian Grand Prix in March. For the first time in F1 history, the 2024 season saw all teams on the grid stick with the same driver lineup from the year before but there is much more upheaval ahead of 2025.Having previously driven for Toro Rosso, Renault and McLaren, Sainz had been linked with a number of seats for the 2025 season including Alpine, Sauber and Mercedes. However, his immediate future was decided on Monday when it was confirmed he has agreed an initial two-year deal with Williams.“I am very happy to announce that I will be joining Williams Racing from 2025 onwards,” the 29-year-old said. “It is no secret that this year’s driver market has been exceptionally complex for various reasons and that it has taken me some time to announce my decision.“However, I am fully confident that Williams is the right place for me to continue my F1 journey and I am extremely proud of joining such a historic and successful team, where many of my childhood heroes drove in the past and made their mark on our sport.“The ultimate goal of bringing Williams back to where it belongs, at the front of the grid, is a challenge that I embrace with excitement and positivity. I am convinced that this team has all the right ingredients to make history again and starting on 1 January I will give my absolute best to drive Williams forward alongside every single member of the team.”Sainz will replace Logan Sargeant at Williams, where he will partner Alex Albon. Williams have struggled in recent seasons and last took a podium finish in 2021, with their last win coming courtesy of Pastor Maldonado’s shock victory at the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix.“Carlos joining Williams is a strong statement of intent from both parties,” said the Williams team principal, James Vowles. “Carlos has demonstrated time and again that he is one of the most talented drivers on the grid, with race-winning pedigree, and this underlines the upwards trajectory we are on.“Carlos brings not just experience and performance, but also a fierce drive to extract every millisecond out of the team and car; the fit is perfect. In Alex and Carlos we will have one of the most formidable driver lineups on the grid and with huge experience to guide us into the new regulations in 2026.”",True,True,True

But her passion for parmesan has also gained attentionThree years ago Italian gymnast Giorgia Villa was cruelly denied her first shot at Olympic glory when she injured her ankle less than two weeks before getting on the plane for Tokyo. On Tuesday, the 21-year-old from Brescia helped Italy to their first medal in artistic gymnastics since 1928, teaming with Angela Andreoli, Alice D’Amato, Manila Esposito and Elisa Iorio to win a historic silver behind the United States.The Italian quintet have become overnight celebrities back home, where they have been dubbed le fate d’argento (the silver fairies). But Villa’s profile has managed to transcend gymnastics in the days since her landmark medal thanks to a viral tweet which unearthed her endorsement deal with parmesan cheese.The images speak for themselves. There’s Villa posing in her leotard next to a wheel of parmesan. There’s Villa seated proudly with three wheels of parmesan, performing an aerial cartwheel over a wheel of parmesan, doing the splits on four wheels of, yep, parmesan. There’s Villa giving a warm embrace to her “best friend” – you guessed it – a wheel of parmesan. More than 20 sponsored posts across Villa’s social media channels have featured her showing off wheels, blocks and bite-size packets of the hard cheese.Olympic silver medalist and Italian gymnast Giorgia Villa is sponsored by parmesan cheese and takes many of her photos while posing with large wheels of cheese pic.twitter.com/klx8PEuFPNThree months before the Tokyo Olympics, Villa signed a sponsorship deal with the Parmigiano Reggiano Consortium (PRC), the association which oversees production and unites all producers of the cheese. A press release hailed the partnership as “confirming how the combination of Parmigiano Reggiano and the world of sport is indissoluble in terms of authenticity, quality and energetic value, both in sporting activity and in correct nutrition”.She is not the first athlete to get in bed with Big Parma. According to the Italian marketing agency Impresa e Sport, Parmigiano Reggiano has also partnered with current world No 1 men’s tennis player Jannik Sinner, former NBA point guard Nico Mannion and Paralympic swimmer Giulia Ghiretti and the fencer Matteo Neri. The association boasts that Parmesan cheese, which is made through a manufacturing process dating to the 13th century, is “suitable for a sports diet”. Some health experts agree, describing it as “easy digested, for the presence of ready to use proteins and lipids, lactose free, rich in calcium, with possible prebiotic and probiotic effect”.Villa’s mother signed her up for gymnastics lessons “before I destroyed her whole house” due to her high energy and activity level. “I had just started nursery school, but I immediately understood that I would love that sport with all my being,” she said. “I left school and, still wearing my pink apron, I couldn’t wait to enter that gym and jump and run feeling free and happy.”Since the age of 11 she has been schooled at the Italian Gymnastics Federation’s International Academy of Brescia, training six days a week. Villa no doubt caught the eye of the PRC’s power brokers after the 2019 world championships where she competed on all four apparatus to lead Italy to a surprise bronze, the country’s first team medal since 1950.No longer able to compete in the all-around due to a recurring back injury, Villa’s clean uneven bars routine on Tuesday played no small part in Italy’s historic medal. But it’s Villa’s magnetic enthusiasm that has enamoured the throngs of media who have packed the Bercy Arena over the past week. She could hardly contain her excitement after Sunday’s qualifying round, where she performed before a celebrity-flecked crowd that included Tom Cruise, Lady Gaga, Jessica Chastain, Ariana Grande and Anna Wintour.“Biles and her teammates are fabulous gymnasts, what can I say?” Villa said. “Simone is from another planet. Seeing her vault and all her acrobatics from so close up is a unique privilege.”It was unclear at time of writing which cheese variety Biles prefers.",True,True,True
"Spain wins Euro 2024, defeating England 2-1 in a dramatic final to claim record fourth European Championship","Spain wins Euro 2024, defeating England 2-1 in a dramatic final to claim record fourth European Championship                    Spain won a record-breaking fourth European Championship, defeating England 2-1 following a drama-filled second half in the Euro 2024 final on Sunday in Berlin.                  Nico Williams – one of Spain’s breakout performers at the tournament – gave La Roja the lead minutes into the second half when he smartly finished in the bottom corner from a perfectly-weighted pass from the team’s other emerging star, freshly turned 17-year-old Lamine Yamal.                  England equalized midway through the second half through a brilliantly placed left-footed effort from Cole Palmer from outside the box to restore parity at the Olympiastadion in the German capital.                  But with just under five minutes remaining in regulation time, Spain took a late lead when Mikel Oyarzabal tapped home an inch-perfect pass from Marc Cucurella to cap off a victory and a terrific tournament for La Roja.                  It is Spain’s fourth Euro title – having previously won in 1964, 2008 and 2012 – while for England, it is heartbreak for a second straight European Championship having been beaten by Italy on penalties at Euro 2020.                  The game began in tight fashion befitting a major final, with both teams feeling one another out as the players overcame any pre-match nerves. As predicted by many, Spain enjoyed the majority of the possession in the opening 30 minutes, however, it did so without producing any real goalscoring opportunities.                  While La Roja dominated the ball as it strived to create an opening, it was England which had the first shot on target on the stroke of halftime with a Phil Foden snapshot from close range, but it flew straight at Unai Simón in the Spanish goal.                  Spain was delt a major blow at halftime when one of its most important players, Manchester City midfielder Rodri, was forced off through injury. He was replaced by Real Sociedad’s Martín Zubimendi.                  But the Iberians didn’t seem dismayed by the loss of their star midfielder when a sweeping move two minutes after the break was expectedly finished by Williams to give La Roja a deserved lead. At the age of 22 years and two days old, Williams became the second youngest player to score in a Euro final.                  The goal seemed to kick Spain up a gear, with Dani Olmo coming inches away from extending the lead a minute later, but his effort flew wide of the post.                  England was on the ropes in the aftermath of Williams’ goal, first with captain Álvaro Morata’s deft dink being cleared away by John Stones before the Athletic Bilbao man fired just wide as he searched for his second of the game.      Related article ‘Orange madness:’ Meet the man behind the viral dance craze sweeping Euro 2024              As the Three Lions sought a way back into the game, manager Gareth Southgate made the bold decision to bring off captain and all-time record goalscorer Harry Kane and replace him with Ollie Watkins, fresh off scoring a last-gasp winner in the semifinal against the Netherlands to book the team’s spot in the final.                  The substitution seemed to galvanize the English, with the team playing with more verve and pace. Jude Bellingham fired an effort wide of the post which had the England fans on their feet for the first time in a while.                  But just when England was building a head of steam, Spain almost got a second through Yamal – who became the youngest player ever to feature in a Euro or World Cup final when he stepped onto the field on Sunday night – but Jordan Pickford stuck out a big hand to deny the Barcelona prodigy.                  England did eventually get its goal – and it came from one of Southgate’s substitutes. Chelsea midfielder Palmer, who had been introduced into the game for 19-year-old Kobbie Mainoo just minutes before, latched onto a neat set-up from Bellingham and caressed an inch-perfect effort into the bottom corner to level the score.                  Spain built itself back into the game and came close to retaking the lead with 10 minutes remaining after some intricate build-up play left Yamal one-on-one with Pickford, but the 17-year-old’s effort was parried away by the England goalkeeper.                  As time ticked away and extra-time loomed, Spain finally got its deserved late goal through another flowing move which ended with Cucurella sliding in an appealing cross for Oyarzabal to steer home and spark wild celebrations.                  England had become renowned for late heroics at Euro 2024, and the squad needed yet another moment of magic if it had any hopes of getting back into the game.                  As the clock hit 90 minutes, a corner was headed towards goal by Declan Rice, with Simón parrying it out to Guehi whose effort was cleared off the line by RB Leipzig man Dani Olmo as Spain’s defense celebrated thwarting another English attack.                  The Three Lions threw everything they could to take it to extra time, but after four additional minutes, referee François Letexier blew the final whistle and Spain’s players dropped to the ground before joining the sea of fans clad in red and yellow inside the stadium in celebration.                  Ahead of the lifting of the trophy, Rodri was named the Euro 2024 player of the tournament, while Yamal was named the young player of the tournament.                  Yamal, who turned 17 the day before the final, appeared in every one of Spain’s seven games in Germany, providing a tournament-high four assists and scoring one goal: a stunning, record-breaking effort in the semifinal against France which made him the youngest ever scorer in Euro history.                  For England, its 58-year search for a major men’s international trophy goes on after winning the World Cup in 1966.                  Afterwards, King Charles III released a message of support for the England players on X, formerly known as Twitter.                  “Although victory may have eluded you this evening, nevertheless my wife and I join all my family in urging you and your support team to hold your heads high. All those who have participated in sporting activities at any level will know how utterly despairing such a result can feel when the prize was so near – and will join me in sending heartfelt sympathy, even as we congratulate Spain.                  “But please know that your success in reaching the European Championship final is a really great achievement in itself, and one that brings with it the pride of a nation which will continue to roar for the Three Lions today – and in the many triumphs which I have no doubt lie ahead.”        This story has been updated with additional information. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Lionel Messi inspires Argentina to second consecutive Copa América final,"Lionel Messi inspires Argentina to second consecutive Copa América final        Lionel Messi helped guide Argentina to this year’s Copa América final after scoring in his nation’s 2-0 win against Canada in the semifinals on Tuesday.                  The 37-year-old scored early in the second half to double Argentina’s lead after Julián Álvarez had given La Albiceleste a first-half lead.                  It means Argentina has now reached the Copa América final in six of the previous eight tournaments, with this being its second in row – the South American side won the 2021 title.      Related article Lamine Yamal: Spain beats France to reach Euro 2024 final after historic goal from 16-year-old              “Let’s enjoy what we are experiencing as a national team, as a group. It is not easy to be in a final again, to compete again to be champions,” Messi told TyC Sports after the match, per Reuters.                  “I’m living it as I have been living everything lately: enjoying it very much and being aware.”                  Argentina will face either Uruguay or Colombia in Sunday’s final which will be held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.                  Canada head coach Jesse Marsch told reporters before the semifinal that he was aware just how difficult it would be to play Argentina, but his side started well against the reigning world champion.                  Canada winger Jacob Shaffelburg, though, was made to rue two missed opportunities in the early stages as Argentina striker Álvarez opened the scoring with a composed touch and finish in the 22nd minute.                  The goal was a sign of the quality that Canada, the world No. 48, was up against.                  Messi, possibly playing at his final Copa América for Argentina, then started finding his stride and went close twice before the end of the first half.                  The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner eventually got his goal shortly into the second half as Enzo Fernández’s shot deflected off the Inter Miami forward, catching Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau off guard.                  Canada is now the 38th team that Lionel Messi has scored against while playing for his country, per Opta.                  Despite not reaching the final, Canada impressed at this year’s tournament and showed promising signs for the upcoming World Cup in 2026, which it’s co-hosting alongside Mexico and the US.                  “[The tournament] has gone way better than any of us could have scripted,” Marsch told reporters after the game.                  “There is still a lot of work to do, but we’ve built a really good foundation and I’m really optimistic about what the future can look like.”                  Canada will now play the loser of the other semifinal in the third-place playoff on Saturday.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

US men’s soccer team dealt heavy defeat by host France in opening Olympic matc,"US men’s soccer team dealt heavy defeat by host France in opening Olympic match       Follow:             The US men’s soccer team suffered a brutal return to Olympic action as it was beaten 3-0 by host nation France in its opening match of the Paris Games on Wednesday.                  The soccer tournament at this year’s Olympics kicked off two days before the Opening Ceremony, with teams consisting predominantly of under-23 players. Each nation, though, is allowed three overaged players.                  Playing in its first Olympic Games since 2008, the young US men’s team knew an opening match against the host would be a tough test but, for the first hour at least, it looked more than capable of causing an upset.                  Led by coach Marko Mitrović, the Americans looked threatening in attack and could have scored in the first half as France struggled with the occasion.                  In truth, though, wastefulness in front of goal led to the US’ downfall as France’s quality eventually shone through, much to the enjoyment of fans inside the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille.                  Moments after Djordje Mihailović struck the crossbar for the US, France captain Alexandre Lacazette broke the deadlock with a fine strike in the 61st minute.      Related article Argentina coach slams ‘circus’ as chaos descends on Olympic soccer opener              The US didn’t fold, though, and came close to equalizing just minutes later, but defender John Tolkin saw his header cannon off the crossbar.                  France weathered the storm once again and doubled its lead through new Bayern Munich star Michael Olise in the 69th minute.                  Defender Loïc Badé then dealt the final blow with a header in the 85th minute, giving France the perfect start to its campaign.                  “I’m very pleased with the result. I feel we managed to overcome some of the stress we had. It was a tough game,” France manager Thierry Henry said after the game.                  “They could have scored. They hit the post, but we managed to correct some things and, after our first goal, we played better.”                  The US now sits bottom of Group A and will face New Zealand in its next match on July 27. It will then play Guinea in the final group match on July 30. Elsewhere in Group A on Wednesday, New Zealand beat Guinea 1-0.                  Meanwhile, Spain beat Uzbekistan 2-1, while Japan thrashed Paraguay 5-0 in some of the other standout scores of the soccer tournament so far.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Andy Murray confirms he will retire after the Paris Olympics,"Andy Murray confirms he will retire after the Paris Olympics        Andy Murray has confirmed that he will retire from professional tennis after the Paris Olympics, saying it will be his “last ever tennis tournament.”                  The 37-year-old, a three-time grand slam champion, will be appearing at his fifth Games and is the only man in history to win two Olympic singles gold medals.                  Murray was unable to play in the singles competition in the final Wimbledon tournament of his career earlier this month after undergoing surgery on a spinal cyst, but got an emotional farewell playing doubles with his brother Jamie on Centre Court.                  He previously said he wouldn’t rule out participating at other tournaments this season if he was unable to be competitive at Wimbledon and the Olympics.                  “Arrived in Paris for my last ever tennis tournament. Competing for Team GB have been by far the most memorable weeks of my career and I’m extremely proud to get do it one final time!” he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.                  Murray won the first Olympic gold of his career at London 2012 after beating Roger Federer in straight sets just weeks after a heartbreaking defeat to the Swiss in the Wimbledon final.                  That victory proved to be the catalyst for Murray’s first triumph in SW19 the following year as he became the first British man in 77 years to lift the Wimbledon trophy.                  Murray then defended his Olympic title four years later in Rio, defeating Juan Martín del Potro in the final. He also has a mixed doubles silver medal from London 2012.                  “5th Olympics. Final tournament,” Murray’s mother Judy posted on X.                  Murray carved out a remarkable career in the greatest era in men’s tennis history, claiming three grand slams – two Wimbledons and a US Open – two Olympic golds, the 2016 ATP Finals title, 14 Masters 1000 titles and a year-end world No. 1 ranking.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Oscar Piastri wins his first ever F1 Grand Prix in Hungary,"Oscar Piastri wins his first ever F1 Grand Prix in Hungary in tense race highlighted by McLaren team drama                    Australia’s Oscar Piastri won his maiden Formula One Grand Prix on Sunday, but probably not in the circumstances he would have dreamed.                  The McLaren driver qualified second and snatched the lead at the start of the Hungarian Grand Prix from teammate Lando Norris and looked set to take claim victory after driving a commanding race.                  However, Norris came in for his second pit stop earlier than Piastri, ‘undercutting’ his teammate and eventually emerging ahead after the Aussie had pitted three laps later.                  McLaren’s plan appeared to be to allow Piastri to pass Norris and retake the lead that he had earned once he caught up him using his fresher tires, but he was unable to close the gap. Norris meanwhile resisted calls from his race engineer to slow down and let Piastri past, knowing that he had the pace advantage in the latter stages of the race.                  It seemed as though McLaren was headed towards an embarrassing intra-team conflict that likely would have been avoided by simply pitting Piastri first, but Norris eventually eased up to let Piastri through on lap 68 of 70 to give McLaren its first one-two finish since 2021.                  Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton crossed the line in third to claim a record-extending 200th career podium.                  Though the celebrations felt somewhat subdued, it was still a career milestone for Piastri.                  “It’s very, very special,” said the 23-year-old. “This is really the day I dreamed of as a kid, standing on the top step of an F1 podium.                  “Obviously, a bit complicated at the end, but I put myself in the right position at the start, and thank you to the team for an amazing effort and amazing car.”                  Piastri won a sprint race in Qatar last season, though Sunday marked his first official Grand Prix victory, becoming the fifth Australian to achieve the feat. He is also the first driver born in the 2000s to win a race.                  He admitted that the last few laps made him “nervous” and lamented his lack of pace in the latter stages of the race, but said that he “was still in the right position to make it happen, so well-executed from the team.”                  It was a frustrating day for Norris, who saw the lead slip away at the start of the race after qualifying on pole position, before being forced to hand P1 over to his teammate.                  His race engineer, Will Joseph, pleaded with him over team radio for multiple laps, urging him to “do the right thing” before Norris eventually gave in.                  “It’s tough, but I know what Oscar’s done for me in the past,” said the Briton. “I think this is a little bit different but, yeah, at the same time, I got told to let him past and I did. It’s always tough when you’re fighting for a win, and a win means so much to me and also to him.                  “Yeah, I just had to try put myself in his shoes and understand it that way. Every driver’s selfish and you have to be selfish in this game, but when you’re just thinking of your own benefits, you’re only thinking of the good things. But, of course, I put myself in his shoes and I realized I had to do what was right.”                  Norris – who also congratulated Piastri on his win – won his first Grand Prix in Miami earlier this year and closed the gap on championship leader Max Verstappen, who was involved in one of the race’s most dramatic moments.                  Chasing Hamilton for third, he made contact with his long-time rival after locking up and going too deep into turn one, briefly vaulting the rear of his car into the air.                  This came after several heated radio exchanges of his own, with the Dutchman expressing his frustration at his lack of pace and what he believed was a poor strategy from his Red Bull team. He eventually finished fifth behind Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc.                  Verstappen said after the race that he had no intention of apologizing to his team for his rant and that the group should focus on improving.                  “I don’t think we need to apologize,” he said. “We just need to do a better job. I don’t know why people think that you cannot be vocal on the radio. This is a sport, you know? If some people don’t like that, then stay home.”                  F1 next heads to Spa this weekend for the Belgian Grand Prix.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

F1 history-maker Zhou Guanyu becomes the sport’s first Chinese driver,"F1 history-maker Zhou Guanyu achieved the ‘impossible’ by becoming the sport’s first Chinese driver  There have been 776 drivers in the 74-year history of the Formula One World Championship, but the sport had never had a Chinese racer until the arrival of Zhou Guanyu.After getting his chance in 2022, the Kick Sauber (formerly Alfa Romeo) driver has blazed a trail for his nation across three seasons in F1, even if he had to wait to achieve his dream of racing in front of his home fans.The Chinese Grand Prix, which had been a fixture of the F1 calendar since 2004, was suspended between 2020 and 2023 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and its restrictions.F1 did eventually return to Shanghai earlier this year, and Zhou took to the track in front of an adoring home crowd. His 14th place finish in the grand prix was almost secondary on a weekend that he described on social media as “unforgettable.” Around 60,000 fans packed the stands on each day of the race weekend.“For me, it’s more about bringing a sport (to China) that is probably not relevant to us or not so popular for us,” Zhou told CNN at a recent Zero Petroleum’s Fuel Reinvented event.“And when it looks like it’s impossible, to get a drive on the grid and then to make that breakthrough to be the first one, in China it basically gives a lot of hopes for the younger generations.”Zhou began his motorsport career in karting, getting into racing at eight years old. He left China four years later, moving to Sheffield, England to continue his development with the Strawberry Racing Karting team.He enjoyed success in the UK, winning multiple titles before being signed to the prestigious Ferrari Driver Academy.He then progressed into open-wheel racing and competed in various junior series, such as Formula Three, before joining the Alpine (then Renault) academy in 2018 ahead of his jump to Formula Two.A third-place finish in the F2 championship in 2021 caught the eye of F1’s Alfa Romeo, who signed Zhou to a multi-year deal and gave him his opportunity on the biggest stage as part of an overhaul of its driver lineup partnering the incoming Valtteri Bottas.An arduous journey – that began with Zhou moving all the way across the world as a child in pursuit of his dream – was finally complete“All these achievements, sacrifice, anticipating we’ve done as a family, as a group of people in my team – I’ve just been really grateful to have them there,” he said. “We finally achieved the goal that looked like it was impossible at the beginning.”At the opening of the 2022 season in Bahrain, Zhou scored points at the first time of asking, coming home to finish 10th on debut.However, Zhou has had an up-and-down two and a half seasons in F1. He finished in the points on a further five occasions and came within two places of scoring on several occasions, despite the Sauber car often being uncompetitive. He also has two fastest laps to his name.‘Obviously, (it’s been) only three years but time flies,” said the 25-year-old Zhou. “It feels like I’ve been through a lot of things, first year scoring points on debut and then having that big incident at Silverstone. Then having multiple technical issues that put me out of points.“So all these things, it’s a bit more challenging, but I went through it all. I’m quite happy with the achievement we did.”Zhou might have only mentioned his 2022 incident at Silverstone in passing, but it is impossible to forget the horrific crash he sustained.At the start of that year’s race, he made contact with Mercedes’ George Russell, causing his Alfa Romeo to flip over, skid across the track and gravel upside-down for several seconds before flipping over the tire barrier and catch fencing, which is there to protect fans.It was one of the most terrifying crashes in recent years, but Zhou escaped unscathed and said afterwards that the halo protection device on his car saved his life.Having never been one to shy away from adversity, Zhou did not let the incident affect his rookie campaign or his career as a whole, looking back on what he has achieved positively.“I’m proud of the opportunity given by the Sauber group, who gave me the opportunity to reach my dream, to get on this grid,” he said.“There’s still plenty of things I can improve on, so hopefully I’ll be continuing for many more years on this grid.”Away from the racetrack, Zhou is known for his fashion sense and frequently turns heads with his outfits on race weekends, often sporting designer attire.He has drawn comparisons to seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton for his sartorial tastes, with Zhou crediting the Briton for helping drivers feel comfortable about expressing themselves in different ways in the paddock.His colorful helmet designs are just as eye-catching as his black and neon green Kick Sauber liveried car, which is emblazoned with the number 24 on it.Zhou explained that he was unable to use his favorite number three upon arriving in F1 as it was already being used by Daniel Ricciardo, while 33 had been used the season prior by Max Verstappen – numbers have to be out of use for two whole seasons before they become available again.As a result, he opted to pay tribute to one of his heroes, the late Kobe Bryant, who wore 24 on his jersey during the second part of his Hall of Fame NBA career.“I wanted to have a number that means something to me,” he said. “Kobe was an athlete I grew up watching him all the time, playing for the (Los Angeles) Lakers.

The longest delay was two minutes and 46 seconds for the start of the final game of the season against West Ham last season, when City clinched a fourth successive title.The club has apologised for the accepted breachesThe statement added: “Rules relating to kick-offs and restarts help ensure the organisation of the competition is set at the highest possible professional standard and provides certainty to fans and participating clubs.“It also ensures the broadcast of all 380 League matches around the world is kept to schedule.”City have not commented directly but the ruling stated: “The club has apologised for the accepted breaches… and confirmed that it has reminded the club’s players and football management teams of their responsibilities in complying with Rule L.33.”PA WirePA WireWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Female boxers Lin Yu-ting and Imane Khelif both previously failed a gender eligibility test but have been cleared to compete at Paris 2024,"Boxing's gender row - what's going on and are Russia involved?  Lin Yu-ting and Imane Khelif are guaranteed a medal at Paris 2024Boxing at Paris 2024 has been overshadowed by a row about the eligibility of two fighters in the women's competition.Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwanese fighter Lin Yu-ting will fight for gold on Friday and Saturday respectively.But last year they were disqualified from the World Championships.The body that oversaw that 2023 event is the International Boxing Association (IBA), and it says both fighters failed gender eligibility tests.On Monday the IBA held a news conference which it had said would provide a ""detailed explanation of the reasons for the disqualification"".However the chaotic media event left more questions than answers.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has cast doubt on the reliability of the tests and suggested what is happening is a ""sometimes politically motivated cultural war"".In June 2023, the IOC stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's amateur world governing body over concerns over how it was run.So, what is going on?IBA holds chaotic news conference on Olympic boxing rowThe IBA, formerly known as AIBA, was formed in 1946 as a worldwide governing body for amateur boxing. The IOC recognised the IBA as the sport's governing body until 2019.The IOC suspended the IBA in 2019.This was because of governance issues and alleged corruption.It led to the threat that boxing would be removed from the Olympics altogether from 2028.In 2018, the IBA issued life bans to ex-president CK Wu and former executive director Ho Kim after a report documented ""gross negligence and financial mismanagement of affairs and finances"". Wu had been in charge for 11 years before being provisionally suspended in October 2017.Wu was replaced as AIBA president by Gafur Rakhimov, who was described by the US Treasury Department as ""one of Uzbekistan's leading criminals"".In 2020, Russian Umar Kremlev was elected president.In 2022, an independent investigation said boxing needed to take action on ethical issues to secure its Olympic future, having found a ""historical culture of bout manipulation"" - including at the 2016 Rio Games.In his final report, Professor Richard McLaren detailed decades of financial mismanagement and deception, rule-breaking in the ring, and inadequate training and education programmes for referees, judges and officials. Kremlev pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the country's newly opened international boxing centre in September 2022Kremlev is seen as having close ties to the Kremlin. Under his leadership, the IBA has had Russian state-backed energy giant Gazprom among its chief sponsors.In May 2022, Kremlev was re-elected unopposed after Dutch boxing federation president Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible.The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) later said Van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing, but a proposal to stage a new election was rejected by IBA delegates.The IOC said it was ""extremely concerned"" by the result, and Van der Vorst said he feared for the sport's Olympic future.The 2023 World Championships were held in two countries. The women's event was in India in March, and the men's in Uzbekistan in April and May.A total of 19 countries, including Great Britain and the USA, boycotted the events after the IBA allowed Russian and Belarusian boxers to compete under their countries' flags, contravening IOC guidance following the invasion of Ukraine.Kremlev said those boycotting the championships were ""worse than hyenas and jackals"" because of their violation of the ""integrity of sport and culture"".At the time, GB Boxing said of its decision to boycott the championships that the flag issues had ""put further distance between IBA and the Olympic movement in addition to the significant, longstanding issues over sporting integrity, governance, transparency and financial management which the IOC has asked IBA to address to protect boxing's place on the Olympic programme"".Russian athletes such as boxer Azalia Amineva are prevented from competing at Paris 2024 for their country. No Russian boxers are at the Games as neutral athletes.At the 2023 World Championships, Khelif was competing in the welterweight category and Lin at featherweight.Hours before Khelif's gold-medal match against China’s Yang Liu, the IBA said the Algerian had failed a gender eligibility test.Khelif had beaten Janjaem Suwannapheng from Thailand in the semi-final, Uzbekistan's Navbakhor Khamidova in the quarter-final and Russia's Azalia Amineva in the round prior to that.As a result of Khelif's disqualification, 21-year-old Amineva had the only loss in her now 22-fight career removed from the record.At the same 2023 World Championships, Lin was stripped of a bronze medal by the IBA.The IBA said the fighters had ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations"".The BBC has, as yet, been unable to determine what the eligibility tests consisted of. It is not known how tests were overseen.In an interview with BBC sports editor Dan Roan last Thursday, IBA chief executive Chris Roberts said male XY chromosomes were found in ""both cases"".Roberts said there were ""different strands involved in that"" and therefore the body could not commit to referring to the fighters as ""biologically male"".He said the unspecified eligibility tests had been conducted as a result of “ongoing concerns” raised by other fighters, coaches and the IBA’s medical committee.At Monday's media event Roberts said Khelif and Lin were first tested at the 2022 World Championships in Istanbul, Turkey but no action was taken as the results were ""inconclusive"".Of the fighters' 2023 disqualifications, he said: ""The results of the chromosome tests demonstrated both boxers were ineligible.""But while Roberts said the pair had ""chromosome tests"", Kremlev appeared to suggest the tests were to determine the fighters' testosterone levels.Testosterone is a hormone that can increase muscle mass and strength. Chromosomes carry genetic information including a person’s sex.""We got the test results that they allowed us to make and these test results show they have high levels of testosterone, like men, said Kremlev.He added that if boxers ""want to prove they were born women, they have to do it by themselves"".The IBA said the tests were sent to two different laboratories that are accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).However, Wada has told BBC Sport it does not oversee gender tests and its work only relates to anti-doping matters.The IOC has previously raised doubts over the accuracy of the tests.""We don't know what the protocol was, we don't know whether the test was accurate, we don't know whether we should believe the test,"" said IOC spokesperson Mark Adams.""There's a difference between a test taking place and whether we accept the accuracy or even the protocol of the test.""This video can not be playedImane Khelif: IOC responds to boxing gender controversyIn a statement lastThursday, the IOC said Khelif and Lin had been ""victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA"".""Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process,"" the IOC said.""According to the IBA minutes available on their website, this decision was initially taken solely by the IBA secretary general and CEO. The IBA board only ratified it afterwards and only subsequently requested that a procedure to follow in similar cases in the future be established and reflected in the IBA regulations. The minutes also say that the IBA should 'establish a clear procedure on gender testing'.""The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure - especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years.""Such an approach is contrary to good governance.""The IBA insisted its decision was ""necessary to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition"".It said in a statement last week: ""The athletes did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test, whereby the specifics remain confidential. This test conclusively indicated that both athletes did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors.""The IBA said Lin did not ultimately appeal against the IBA's decision to Cas, while Khelif withdrew an appeal, ""thus rendering the decisions legally binding"".In June 2023, 69 of 70 Olympic federations voted to strip the IBA of its status.Before the vote, IOC president Thomas Bach said: ""We do not have a problem with boxing. We do not have a problem with boxers.""The boxers fully deserve to be governed by an international federation with integrity and transparency.""In response, the IBA accused the IOC of making a ""tremendous error"" and compared the move to Germany's actions in World War Two.An IBA statement read: ""We have successfully implemented all recommendations outlined by the IOC in its roadmap.""Despite the challenges, the IBA remains committed to the development of boxing and the organisation of official tournaments and world boxing championships at the highest level.""We cannot conceal the fact that today's decision is catastrophic for global boxing and blatantly contradicts the IOC's claims of acting in the best interests of boxing and athletes.""Cas rejected an appeal by the IBA against the decision.A new body, World Boxing, was set up in April 2023. Among five pledges, the new organisation says it will ""keep boxing at the heart of the Olympic movement"" and ""ensure the interests of boxers are put first"".One of its key goals is maintaining boxing as an Olympic sport after it was provisionally dropped from the 2028 Games over the IBA issues.However, it remains in discussions with the IOC to get recognition as the worldwide governing body for the sport.It is backed by representatives from Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Sweden and the United States.The IBA has previously said it ""strongly condemns"" the establishment of a ""rogue"" organisation, adding it has ""initiated a series of actions to protect its autonomy as the official worldwide governing body"".Unlike previous Games, boxing at the Tokyo Olympics was organised by the IOC rather than the IBA.In 2019, the IOC delegated responsibility for the organisation and management of doping control at the Olympics to the International Testing Agency (ITA).The IOC said it took a ""zero-tolerance policy"" to anyone found using or providing doping products.Tests include, but are not excluded to, determining an athlete's levels of testosterone.In late 2021 the IOC issued new guidance on transgender athletes in women’s sport.This placed the responsibility on individual federations to determine eligibility criteria in their sport.The framework came in the aftermath of Tokyo 2020 when weightlifter Laurel Hubbard became the first transgender athlete to compete at the Olympics in a different gender category to that in which they were born.While the IOC said there should be no assumption that a transgender athlete automatically has an unfair advantage in female events, it issued a 10-point document that it expected every sport to apply before Paris 2024.Since then many sports have banned transgender women from taking part in women's sport, such as athletics, aquatics and both rugby codes.However, the rules have been applied differently so there are sports in which transgender women or athletes with differences of sex development (DSD) can compete.Boxing is one of those as the IOC, which has been overseeing Olympic boxing, has not updated the eligibility criteria rules since Tokyo 2020.In boxing the IOC said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female.The IOC said it ""supports the participation of any athlete who has qualified and met the eligibility criteria to compete in the Olympic Games as established by their IF (international federation). The IOC will not discriminate against an athlete who has qualified through their IF, on the basis of their gender identity and/or sex characteristics"".Both cases had been reported on last year around the World Championships, although not widely in Europe or the US given the boycotts of the event.The IOC included the details on the media information portal before Paris 2024, although that was later removed.Given heightened scrutiny around women's sport and transgender athletes or people with DSD, media picked up on the IOC saying athletes who had failed the tests were due to compete in the women’s division.Since then the IOC has insisted the fighters were ""born women and raised women"", but the IBA has continued to insist its tests suggest their eligibility for women’s boxing is in question.Khelif will fight for gold on Friday after victory in her semi-final on Tuesday, with Lin's final the following evening.Today's Olympics guideFull Paris Olympics scheduleBBC's Paris Olympics TV schedulePremier League predictions 2024-25: BBC Sport pundits pick their top fourConference League qualifying: Kilmarnock take early lead in Norway, St Mirren trailingThe air crash and the underdogs -  a triumph for a lost generationChloe Ayling was the victim no-one believedThe unbelievable true story of Chloe's kidnapping and the media frenzy that followedCan a werewolf, a vampire and a ghost live together?Comedy-drama starring Aidan Turner, Russell Tovey and Lenora CrichlowA dark web of secrets is about to be untangledWatch every episode of the tense thriller starring Jenna ColemanThe story of Manchester United's legendary Busby Babes.

Keely Hodgkinson becomes sixth fastest woman in history with stunning 800m win,"Keely Hodgkinson becomes sixth fastest woman in history with stunning 800m win at pre-Olympic London Diamond League  Keely Hodgkinson ran a huge personal best to win the London Diamond League and become the sixth fastest women in history over 800m.Hodgkinson’s time of 1:54.61 was also a British record and the best time in the world this year, and cemented her status as the women to beat at the Paris Olympic Games, which open on Friday.She led throughout the race and streaked away from fellow Briton Jemma Reekie in the final 100m, with Georgia Bell coming in third to complete a British one-two-three. Both Reekie and Bell also recorded personal bests.Hodgkinson glanced at the clock as she crossed the line and smothered her face with her hands in shock at her achievement.“I felt really good today, I just wanted to go for it and see what was there,” she told the BBC. “It was a little bit of bravery and fearlessness with a great atmosphere like this, I didn’t want to waste the opportunity.“It’s so nice when you’re walking through and you hear people shouting your name. The Brits know how to put on an athletics meet, I wish there were more in this country because it’s the best crowd I’ve ever run in front of.“I’m feeling really good and confident ahead of Paris. Obviously the main aim is just to get to the final first and then once we’re there we can discuss getting medals.”Matt Hudson-Smith set another British record and another world lead time as he won the men’s 400m in 43.74s, laying down a huge marker ahead of Paris.“It was an amazing crowd, it’s always good to perform in front of them and it’s a great send off,” Hudson-Smith said. “It’s a long time coming and I’m actually healthy. Now I’m putting in a lot of work. The proof is in the pudding. I’m excited.”Olympic favourite Noah Lyles came from behind to comfortably win the men’s 100m, after Dina Asher-Smith had finished third in the women’s 200m, won by the fast-finishing American Gabby Thomas.Lyles has developed into the biggest personality in athletics and, having taken the 100m world title in Budapest last year to add to three, and an Olympic bronze, over the 200m, he is becoming the man to beat in the blue riband event.“That was fun,” he said after running a personal best time of 9.81s. “I could have had a better start. I wanted a faster time but I had the wind.”South African Akani Simbini took second in 9.86 and Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo was third in 9.88 as the first five broke 10 seconds.Briton’s rising sprint star Louie Hinchliffe finished fourth. “I’m not happy with the result but it’s not bad, it wasn’t my worst run,” the 22-year-old said. “I can work on the start, I looked well out of it. Maybe some nerves, it’s my first time here. I’ve got some way to go.”Jamaica’s Nickisha Pryce also looked very impressive in running a world-leading time of 48.57s to win the women’s 400m, while Femke Bol of the Netherlands easily won the women’s 400m hurdles in 51.30s, cementing her status as another gold-medal contender in Paris.The 24-year-old world champion, who won bronze in Tokyo, dominated the race from the start and sent a message to biggest rival Sydney McLaughlin as the pair prepare to square off in one of the most eagerly-anticipated Olympic showdowns.In the men’s 400m hurdles, Brazil’s former world champion Alison dos Santos won in 47.18s, while Italy’s Leonardo Fabbri caused a surprise in the shot put, throwing 22.52m to beat heavy favourite Ryan Crouser of the USA.Britain’s Molly Caudery finished third in the pole vault competition, having won world indoor gold earlier this year. “I am a little bit disappointed, I feel like it was a lost opportunity,” she said. “I’m kicking myself. [But] it’s not the place where it matters too much and I’m looking forward to Paris.”Marner took questions from the media following the unveiling of Auston Matthews as the 26th captain in franchise history on Wednesday.Scottie Scheffler showed up for the FedEx St. Jude Championship in Memphis this week with his Olympic gold medal but he wasn’t exactly showing it off. “It's a bit heavy around the neck,” he told members of the meYou've probably seen the viral photo of Sha'Carri Richardson from the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Ralf Schumacher comes out as gay in social media post,"Ralf Schumacher comes out as gay in social media post                    Former Formula One driver Ralf Schumacher, younger brother of seven times world champion and Ferrari great Michael, announced on Sunday he was in a same-sex relationship.                  “The most beautiful thing in life is when you have the right partner by your side with whom you can share everything,” he wrote below an Instagram photograph of himself and another man with their arms around each other, watching a sunset over the ocean.                  The only other known male gay driver in the history of Formula One was the late Briton Mike Beuttler, who raced from 1971 to 1973 and died in 1988.                  Ralf Schumacher, 49, won six grands prix in an 11-year career that ended in 2007. He was previously married to Cora, with whom he has a son, David, 22.                  “I am very happy that you have finally found someone with whom you really feel that you feel very comfortable and secure…I am 100% behind you dad and wish you all the best and congratulations,” David wrote on Instagram.                  German actress Carmen Geiss, a close friend, named Schumacher’s partner as Etienne and published a photograph of the couple on her own Instagram account.                  “Today he (Ralf) confessed his homosexuality,” she said. “This step was an act of liberation and self-acceptance for him. It was a courageous decision that has matured in him for a long time and one he is now full of pride and confidence.                  “His outing is not only a personal triumph but a sign that he is finally able to live and love his true identity without fear or shame.”     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton to leave Mercedes and join Ferrari ahead of the 2025 season,"Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton to leave Mercedes and join Ferrari ahead of the 2025 season                    Seven-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton will leave Mercedes and join Ferrari for the 2025 season, the teams announced on Thursday.                  In a statement on X, formerly Twitter, Mercedes said that Hamilton, who was contracted with the team until the end of 2025, “has activated a release option in the contract announced last year.”                  Ferrari, meanwhile, announced that the British driver would be joining the team on a “multi-year contract.”                  In a statement on the Mercedes website, Hamilton said: “I have had an amazing 11 years with this team and I’m so proud of what we have achieved together.                  “Mercedes has been part of my life since I was 13 years old. It’s a place where I have grown up, so making the decision to leave was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make.                  “But the time is right for me to take this step and I’m excited to be taking on a new challenge.”                  The 39-year-old, who shares the record for the most F1 world titles with Michael Schumacher, joined Mercedes in 2013 after starting his career with McLaren in 2007.                  A glittering period followed for the British driver, during which he won six titles over the course of seven years.                  Mercedes has struggled to maintain its dominance in recent seasons, but Hamilton, who finished third in last year’s driver standings, signed a contract extension in August, keeping him at the team until the end of the 2025 season.                  However, in a shock move first reported by Sky Sports and Spanish media on Thursday, Hamilton will now join one of the Silver Arrows’ great rivals.                  “We knew our partnership would come to a natural end at some point, and that day has now come,” said Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff.                  “We accept Lewis’s decision to seek a fresh challenge, and our opportunities for the future are exciting to contemplate.”                  Mercedes finished second in last season’s constructor standings, three points ahead of Ferrari in third, but both teams were well behind a superior Red Bull team.                  Hamilton will join Charles Leclerc at Ferrari in 2025, replacing Carlos Sainz. Writing on X, the Spanish driver confirmed that he will leave the team at the end of 2024 and make an announcement about his future “in due course.”                  Speaking to CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies on Thursday, Phil Duncan, a CNN contributor and F1 correspondent with Press Association, said: “Lewis Hamilton’s gone two years without winning [a grand prix], which for him is basically unprecedented, something he’s never had to deal with in his career.                  “At the age of 39, he’s probably thinking this is his last big chance, his last big move, and his last chance to drive for Ferrari – a team that’s always appealed to him … This is probably the biggest transfer in Formula One history and it really does breathe new life in the sport.”        This story has been updated with additional information. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Katie Ledecky untouchable in 1500m freestyles and wins 2024 Paris Olympics gold,"Katie Ledecky still untouchable in 1500m freestyle as she wins 2024 Paris Olympics gold  Medal table   Olympic schedule   How to watch   Olympic newsPARIS — Katie Ledecky was all alone, in a pool here at the 2024 Olympics, crawling ahead of helpless competitors.Katie Ledecky is all alone, still, atop her field, as she has been for more than a decade.She did not need another gold medal to cement her place in the pantheon of Olympic greats. But here, on an unforgettable Wednesday night at Paris La Défense Arena, she won medal No. 12, gold No. 8.She sailed to victory in the 1500-meter freestyle, finishing in an Olympic record time of 15:30.02, 10.33 seconds ahead of the silver medalist, France's Anastasiia Kirpichnikova (15:40.35). Germany's Isabel Gose took bronze (15:41.16).But before they could even finish, Ledecky slapped the water. Famously even-keeled, she unleashed an atypical scream.She screamed because, over the past few days, she had doubted herself. She doubted in the aftermath of Saturday's 400-meter freestyle, when an atypical 4:00.86 yielded an atypical medal: bronze. She doubted whether she had a 15:30 in her, because her first three swims here at the Paris Games ""felt faster than the time,"" she said.On Wednesday, in the face of that doubt, which has nagged her throughout the past year, she ""finally put together a swim that matched how I felt, [that] was in line with what I thought I was capable of.""There was never any doubt about the place or the color of the medal. Ledecky won it by resuming a time-honored Olympic tradition. She wrote another chapter in her picture book of dominance. She spent much of the race swimming in a TV camera frame of her own, no peers in sight — until they appeared, in Ledecky’s peripheral vision and from the wrong side of the screen, headed in the other direction.Such was Ledecky’s superiority yet again in the 1,500, her signature race. Such was her lead that she was often swimming north while seven other women were still swimming south. Such is her supremacy that an Olympic race seemed boring, and the result a foregone conclusion — which, of course, no Olympic medal event is.""It’s not easy,"" Ledecky assured.That it felt that way is a credit to her commitment, to her love affair with the monotonous, arduous work that this sport requires.“I pride myself on that consistency,” she said. “I challenge myself to stay consistent.”“Sometimes,” she added, “it can be tough feeling like you're not having a breakthrough.” She is now 27, well past the prime age for most of her distance swimming predecessors. She has not lowered her own world-record times since 2018; she has not set a new personal best in three of her four events since she was a teen.“But to be really consistent is something that I'm really happy with,” she said last month.It’s the longevity, and the permanence, that makes Ledecky one-of-a-kind.DOMINANCE. pic.twitter.com/E1dpCl9QUD— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) July 31, 2024On Wednesday, she became the oldest woman to ever win Olympic gold at a distance longer than 200 meters. She did it because of her rhythmic, unfailing, perhaps even compulsive devotion to the grind. She never takes time off. In recent years, she has added solo Sunday swims to the sport’s typical six-days-a-week schedule. She seems immune to burnout; impervious to ever feeling mentally fried.It’s the type of dedication most would view as “sacrifice.” But not Ledecky. She genuinely loves the training.“Really,” she said this spring, “if the competitions didn't exist, I think I would still love it.”She loves how she feels in the water. It puts her mind at ease. On Wednesday, she said, as she inched ahead of seven other women, stroke by stroke, into the clear, she kept repeating in her head the names of the men with whom she trains at the University of Florida. ""Just thinking of all the practices that we’ve done,"" Ledecky explained, ""and all the confidence I get from being next to them.""After her bronze in the 400 on Saturday, she teared up when asked about them.“That's why I love this sport,” she said, her voice cracking. “Because I get to spend every day with people like Bobby [Finke], and Kieran [Smith], my coaches, and everyone that believes in me, and pushes me.”Such is her talent and endurance that she trains with some of the best male distance freestylers in the world at Florida. And yes, she hangs with them. Finke, when asked how much he typically beats Ledecky by in practice, said: “I mean, there's definitely times she's beaten me. It’s not much.”So of course she eased ahead of the field Wednesday. Of course she won a race that she has not lost in 14 years, since she was a middle-schooler. Of course she was going to win an eighth Olympic gold, which brings her level with fellow American Jenny Thompson for the title of most decorated female swimmer ever.The only question, and the source of doubt, was the number on the scoreboard.The answer, when she saw it, delighted Ledecky. ""I just wanted to swim a time that I could be really happy with,"" she said. ""And that was one.""It was the eighth fastest time in history. Ledecky now owns all of the top 20. Kirpichnikova, the silver medalist, became the fourth-fastest woman in history — and was still more than 10 seconds back.Katie Ledecky, at the longest of long pool distances, remains untouchable.There will be a new generation of veterans, a new generation of alphas to challenge them and a new generation of fresh blood behind them.Daley, who was a flag bearer for Great Britain, won silver in the synchronized dive in Paris, marking his fifth Olympic medal in his final Olympics.Of Team USA's 40 gold medals, 26 were won by women, who won more than half of USA's medals in an Olympics marked by historic gender parity.Team USA was perfect in the shootout, pushing longtime rival Hungary off the medal stand.Team USA men won their fifth straight Olympic gold medal.Day 15 of the Paris Olympics was big for Team USA with women's soccer, men's basketball, and track and field earning several gold medals.It is the men's volleyball team's sixth medal and first since claiming bronze at Rio 2016.Between some huge moments at the Stade de France to Stephen Curry's comeback win for Team USA, Thursday at the 2024 Paris Olympics provided some incredible photos.France moved to the gold medal game via a tight 73-69 victory over Germany.Grant Holloway had won everything there is to win as a superstar hurdler except this, an Olympic final, a gold medal on the grandest stage in sport.

Ex-F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone spared jail after admitting tax fraud,"Former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone spared jail after admitting tax fraud  Ecclestone pleaded guilty to a fraud charge over his failure to declare millions of dollars held in a trust in Singapore to UK’s government.Former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone was spared an immediate prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to misleading The United Kingdom’s tax authority about overseas assets worth more than 400 million pounds ($492m).Ecclestone has also agreed a civil settlement with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), under which he will pay 652.6 million pounds ($798.4m) covering tax, interest and penalties for 18 tax years between 1994 and 2022, prosecutor Richard Wright said on Thursday.The 92-year-old appeared at London’s Southwark Crown Court and pleaded guilty to one count of fraud by false representation, just more than a month before he was due to stand trial.Ecclestone admitted giving a misleading answer to HMRC at a July 2015 meeting, when he said he had established only a single trust in favour of his daughters and was not a beneficiary or settlor of any other trust.He was, in fact, the settlor and beneficiary of various trusts, including one which held a company that sent 416 million pounds ($509m) to a bank account in Singapore in 2010, HMRC said.Judge Simon Bryan gave Ecclestone a 17-month prison sentence suspended for two years, meaning he will only go to jail if he commits another criminal offence during that time.Ecclestone’s lawyer Clare Montgomery told the court Ecclestone “did not know the true position” about whether he was the beneficiary or settlor of any other trust, saying his answer to HMRC was an “impulsive lapse of judgment”.Ecclestone gave an unintelligible response to reporters as he left the court.Andrew Penhale, chief crown prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service, said in a statement, “All members of UK society, regardless of how wealthy or famous they are, must pay their taxes and be transparent and open with HMRC about their financial affairs.”Richard Las, chief investigation officer and director of the Fraud Investigation Service at HMRC, said Ecclestone had “lied to HMRC”.“This conviction demonstrates no one is above the law and HMRC will work tirelessly to ensure the tax system is fair to all and pays for our vital public services,” he added.⚖️ Billionaire businessman Bernie Ecclestone has admitted fraud following a lengthy, complex and worldwide investigation into his tax affairs by HMRC and prosecution by the CPS.He has paid more than £652m and was sentenced to 17 months' imprisonment, suspended for two years.— Crown Prosecution Service (@CPSUK) October 12, 2023Ecclestone had attempted to stop the prosecution earlier this year, with his lawyers arguing that putting him on trial posed a serious risk to his life.A cardiologist gave evidence that the stress of the trial meant that Ecclestone was “more likely to die than not during the trial”, according to a June ruling.However, Bryan said there was “no real and immediate threat to the life of Mr Ecclestone by reason of the trial process”.The decision also states that Ecclestone paid approximately 250 million pounds in income and capital gains tax to HMRC between 1999 and 2017.His lawyer Montgomery had noted at a previous hearing in January that Ecclestone was charged shortly after he made “unpopular” comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin.Follow Al Jazeera English:",True,True,True
Carles Falcón dies aged 45 following Dakar Rally Motorbike crash,"Motorbike rider Carles Falcón dies aged 45 following Dakar Rally crash                    Spanish motorbike rider Carles Falcón has died from injuries he sustained in a crash while competing at the Dakar Rally more than a week ago, race organizers announced on Monday. He was 45.                  “It was with great sadness that we learned of the death of Spanish rider Carles Falcon from his family,” Dakar Rally organizers said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.                  The statement added: “The Dakar Rally organizers and competitors offer their most sincere condolences to his family and friends.”                  Falcón was 448 kilometers (278.37 miles) into the second stage of the iconic race in Saudi Arabia when he crashed and was airlifted to hospital for urgent medical care.                  His Twin Trail Racing team wrote on Instagram on Monday: “Carles has left us. The medical team has confirmed that the neurological damage caused by the cardiorespiratory attack at the moment of the accident is irreversible.”                  Following the crash, Twin Trail said that the Spaniard was “unconscious and without a pulse” following the incident but had been resuscitated by doctors.                  After being airlifted to a hospital in Al Duwadimi and then transferred to a hospital in Riyadh, Falcón was repatriated to Spain, according to race organizers.                  Born in the Spanish city of Tarragona, Falcón was “surrounded by motorbikes” throughout his life, Twin Trail’s online profile of the rider said. He was previously a finisher at the Dakar Rally in 2022.                  “Carles was a smiley person, always active, who enjoyed with a passion everything that he did, especially on motorbikes,” Twin Trail added in its Instagram post.                  “He has left us doing something which was his dream, racing in the Dakar. He was enjoying it, he was happy on top of his bike. We should remember him for his smile and for the happiness he generated in others.”                  Falcón worked as an IT engineer and was also a motorbike instructor and tour guide in his spare time.                  “There are many who have learned by his side,” said Twin Trail.                  “He taught with patience, energy and happiness; he made everyone enjoy motorbikes. This is what he has left us and we will always keep within ourselves, all of us who have been close to him, family, friends, teammates and fans.                  “From his family and the team, we please ask that you respect the privacy of the farewell events that will be held in the coming days.”                  The Dakar Rally is one of the world’s longest and most demanding endurance races and this year covers 7,891 kilometers (more than 4,900 miles) from AlUla to Yanbu in Saudi Arabia, concluding on January 19.

"Former Kansas City Chiefs defensive lineman Isaiah Buggs has been found guilty in an Alabama court of animal cruelty charges, ","Former Kansas City Chiefs defensive lineman found guilty of animal cruelty                    Former Kansas City Chiefs defensive lineman Isaiah Buggs has been found guilty in an Alabama court of animal cruelty charges, Tuscaloosa County court records show.                  Buggs was arrested in May and charged with two counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty.                  He was sentenced on July 19 to “365 days of hard labor for Tuscaloosa County” and ordered to serve 60 days with credit from July 16, 2024, court documents show.                  “It is hereby ordered and adjudged that the execution of the remaining 300 days be suspended for 2 years, pending the behavior of the defendant,” the judge’s order states.                  Buggs cannot possess or be around firearms and shall not own dogs or cats, it adds.                  He has appealed the sentencing.      Related article Kansas City Chiefs’ Isaiah Buggs arrested for second time this offseason              “There was no guilty plea in the dog abuse case. Per District Court rules, he pled not guilty but stipulated to the underlying facts so the judge could find him guilty and he could appeal for the right to have a jury trial. He was released from jail on bond. The trial will be set in the future,” Buggs’ attorney Greg Gambril told CNN.                  Buggs’ agent Trey Robinson said he had no comment at this time.                  Buggs also has a pending domestic violence case in the county stemming from an arrest in June. At the time of that arrest, his agent told the NFL Network that Buggs “vehemently denies” the animal cruelty allegations, adding that the dogs didn’t belong to him. Robinson also said his client was being targeted as part of an ongoing “subversive campaign” to force the closure of a hookah lounge he owns in Tuscaloosa.                  The domestic violence case is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in August.                  Buggs was drafted in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was also a member of the Las Vegas Raiders and Detroit Lions before signing with the Kansas City Chiefs, where he was on the practice squad. He received a ring after the team won Super Bowl LVIII earlier in 2024. He was later released and is currently a free agent.

Tristan Wirfs agrees to five-year extension with Buccaneers,"Tampa Bay Buccaneers               Tristan Wirfs, Bucs Agree to Five-Year Extension               Senior Writer/EditorOn Monday morning, just after the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' fifth training camp practice, Tristan Wirfs said his contract talks with the team were ""moving good."" Turns out that was an understatement.By Thursday morning, those talks were complete and Wirfs had agreed to a new five-year extension that runs through the 2029 season. Though the Buccaneers typically do not share salary information publicly, Wirfs' deal has been confirmed as the most lucrative one ever for an NFL offensive tackle. It also made him the highest paid player in franchise history.The Buccaneers obviously feel that Wirfs is worth it after he put together a first four seasons that ranks among the best by any player at any position in team annals. In those four campaigns, Wirfs has already won a Super Bowl championship ring, earned both first and second-team Associated Press All-Pro accolades and made the Pro Bowl at both right tackle and left tackle. After two all-star seasons on the right edge, Wirfs moved over the left side in 2023 and immediately ranked as one of the best players at that position in the NFL, earning another Pro Bowl invitation.""From the day he walked in the door, Tristan has brought a work ethic and a commitment to greatness that has elevated everybody in the building,"" said Buccaneers General Manager Jason Licht. ""He has established himself as a premier offensive linemen in the league and has become an unquestioned leader inside the locker room. Tristan is pivotal to our success as a team, and we are ecstatic to retain a player and a person of his caliber. We are proud to have him as a cornerstone of our team and we look forward to achieving more great things together.""Tampa Bay selected Wirfs with the 13th overall pick in the 2020 draft after trading up one spot in the first round. He won the starting right tackle job to open his rookie season and opened all 20 games, playoffs included, as the Buccaneers won the second league title in franchise history. He has since started all 71 games in which he has played, missing just four contests in 2022.As a first-round pick, Wirfs' initial contract was the standard four-year structure with a team option for a fifth season, which the Buccaneers picked up in the spring of 2023. He is now headed into that fifth season and his new contract will kick in in 2025.Wirfs chose not to hold out during his contract negotiations and has instead attended every training camp practice and meeting. Given the possibility of injury, he hasn't been taking part in full-team drills during practice but has been on hand to get mental reps. He couldn't bear the thought of being away from his teammates during a very important part of the preparations for the upcoming season, in which the Bucs will try to win a fourth straight division title. Now Wirfs can get fully back into the mix with his teammates.""I think that's just part of who I am,"" said Wirfs of his decision to stay with the team. ""Like I said, it was hard enough sitting out those OTAs, so [I am] just wanting to be out there with the guys and not let them down. Just knowing what's at stake almost. We got close last year, so every rep counts, being out there as much as I can, building that camaraderie, building the continuity with everybody, with the line. We've got a new guard competition, center competition, so it's like wanting to get all our communication down and be on the same page. So [I'm] just trying to be out there with my guys as much as possible.""Since the end of the 2023 campaign, the Buccaneers have done a significant amount of work to keep the core of a team that has made four straight playoff appearances intact. Potential free agents Mike Evans, Lavonte David, Baker Mayfield and Chase McLaughlin all were re-signed, and Antoine Winfield Jr. got the franchise tag and later a long-term deal making him the highest paid defensive back in NFL history. The new deal for Wirfs is another enormous step in that direction.Tampa Bay now has two punters on its preseason roster after Monday's signing of Nolan Cooney, who played four games for Arizona in 2023Youngstown State guard Ryan Johnson, originally signed by the Patriots in May, has signed with the Bucs to take the spot of first-year guard Silas Dzansi, who suffered a season-ending knee injury on SaturdayVeteran guard Sua Opeta will miss the 2024 season due to a knee injury he sustained in Tuesday night's practice, and the team has added former Chattanooga standout Jay Person to its edge rush groupCurrently down a tight end with Tanner Taula injured, the Buccaneers bolstered the spot on Thursday by signing Auburn product Sal Cannella, who has played in multiple other professional leaguesThe Bucs placed rookie QB Zack Annexstad and first-year TE Tanner Taula on the active/non-football injury list on Wednesday, but both players are eligible to return to action at any timeThe Buccaneers now have all of their 2024 draft picks under contract after first-round center inked his first NFL deal on Thursday after minicamp practiceSecond-round OLB Chris Braswell inked his first NFL contract during the Bucs' minicamp on Wednesday, leaving just one 2024 draft pick still unsignedThe Buccaneers, whose receiving group behind Mike Evans and Chris Godwin is mostly inexperienced players players, have signed former Giants WR Sterling Shepard, who previously played with Baker Mayfield at OklahomaWR Cody Thompson joins the Buccaneers after spending most of the past four years in Seattle, where he appeared in a total of 12 regular season gamesOn Thursday, the Buccaneers waived/injured third-year wide receiver Deven Thompkins, whose primarily role the last two seasons has been as a punt and kickoff returnerThe Bucs have just two remaining unsigned draft picks after former Washington standout Jalen McMillan signed his first NFL contract on Wednesday after practiceThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers celebrated Creamsicle Day on August 14th, 2024.Tampa Bay Buccaneers Quarterback Baker Mayfield finds WR Mike Evans in the back of the endzone during Bucs-Jags joint practice.Tampa Bay Buccaneers Linebacker K.J.

India beat South Africa by 7 runs to win ICC T20 World Cup 2024,"India beat South Africa by 7 runs to win ICC T20 World Cup 2024  Virat Kohli’s 59-ball-76 and Hardik Pandya’s three crucial wickets take India to their second ICC T20 title in Barbados.India ended their 13-year wait for an ICC Cricket World Cup trophy when they beat South Africa by seven runs to lift the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 in a thrilling final at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados.South Africa were left heartbroken after coming close to winning their maiden world title but were eventually unable to get over the line against a strong Indian bowling lineup in a match that swayed from end to end on Saturday.Chasing 177 to win, the Proteas seemed in control when they needed 71 runs off 45 balls with six wickets in hand and the pair of Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen leading their chase.India, however, had not given up on their chance of winning their second T20 World Cup.All-rounder Hardik Pandya stepped up to remove Klaasen in his first over and followed it up with the crucial wicket of David Miller, courtesy of a stunning catch on the long off boundary by Suryakumar Yadav.Bumrah, too, lived up to his reputation of answering his captain’s call and breaking partnerships at the most crucial moments in the match.While Pandya may have removed the dangerous Klaasen, it was Bumrah’s in-swinging delivery to bowl out Marco Jansen that opened the gates for India.But long before the match reached its thrilling finale, it was India’s limited-overs batting hero who helped his side post a challenging target for South Africa.When India’s captain and their leading run scorer in the tournament Rohit Sharma was dismissed in the second over, South Africa looked quite pleased with their efforts. And when they sent back the dangerous Rishabh Pant and Suryakumar Yadav before five overs were completed, the Proteas were prancing around the Kensington Oval with joy.What they did not account for, though, was the man who has pulled India out of countless occasions in ICC World Cups over the past 10 years.After all the talk about Virat Kohli’s lack of runs in the tournament, it was the 35-year-old who stood up when it mattered the most.He began with two fours, thanks to Jansen’s nervous start to the innings, and never looked back. As wickets fell around him in the first five overs, Kohli kept the scoreboard ticking over with singles and doubles.At the other end, Axar Patel took on the South African bowlers after being promoted in the batting order to introduce a left-hand right-hand batting combination and take on the bowlers.The tall all-rounder hit four sixes and one four in his 31-ball-47 that brought India’s run rate back on track. But when Patel was dismissed to peg India’s boundary count, Kohli stepped out of the shadows and took on the South African bowlers. He went from 50 in 48 balls to 76 in 59 and helped India post a formidable total for a World Cup final.Shivam Dube played a quick hand of 27 from 16 balls before being dismissed by Anrich Nortje, who was the pick of the pace bowlers for the Proteas.Jansen gave away 49 runs in his four overs, while Kagiso Rabada had a below-par day with the ball as well and finished with figures of 36-1 from his four overs.Maharaj picked up two wickets from his three overs, while his spin-bowling partner Tabraiz Shamsi went wicketless.Kohli, who was named player of the match for his rescue act with the bat, confirmed his T20 international retirement after the match.“This is my last T20 World Cup, and this is exactly what I wanted to achieve,” he said after accepting the award.The former India captain, who won the 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2011, said was “grateful to get the job done for the team on the day it mattered the most.”“It was now or never. This is my last T20 game for India, so I wanted to make the most of it. It is time for the next generation to take over. They will take the team forward in this format.”Kohli admitted that the 13-year wait for a world title had been a long one for a team that reached several semifinals and finals.“It’s been a long wait and not just [for] me alone. You can look at Rohit who has played nine T20 World Cups, and this is my sixth. He deserves it as much as anyone in the squad.“It is hard to explain the emotions I felt after the game.”Follow Al Jazeera English:",True,True,True
Australia stunned hosts India in Ahmedabad to win the men's Cricket World Cup for a sixth time.,"Cricket World Cup 2023: Australia stun hosts India to win sixth title as Travis Head hits century  This video can not be playedAustralia beat India to win their sixth Cricket World CupICC Men's Cricket World Cup final, Ahmedabad:India 240 all out (50 overs): Rahul 66 (107), Kohli 54 (63); Starc 3-55Australia 241-4 (43 overs): Head 137 (120), Labuschagne 58 (110)Australia won by six wicketsScorecardAustralia stunned hosts India in Ahmedabad to win the men's Cricket World Cup for a sixth time. Australia quietened the wild support from the 100,000-strong home crowd by dismissing their previously unbeaten opponents for 240 before Travis Head's sensational century meant they romped to victory with seven overs to spare.After their bowlers expertly took advantage of a slow pitch, Australia were themselves reduced to 47-3 as India hit back in an electric new-ball spell.But Head and Marnus Labuschagne calmly weathered the storm with a stand of 192 as Indian hope drifted away from the world's largest cricket stadium.Head was caught for 137 from 120 balls with just two runs needed, but Glenn Maxwell flogged the winning runs a ball later while Labuschagne ended 58 not out from 110.The superb victory means Australia extend their record as the most successful side in 50-over World Cup history and now sit four titles clear of the rest of the pack.It also caps a six-month period in which they beat India to win the World Test Championship and retained the Ashes in England.India, meanwhile, were left crestfallen as their bid for a first white-ball title since 2011 - an achievement which looked unstoppable as they made rampant progress through the semi-final and group stage - fell at the final hurdle.Pat delivers again to join Australia's all-time greatsAustralia win 'one of the great World Cup victories'Reaction to Australia's victory against IndiaThis video can not be played'Outstanding' Head's 137 guides Australia to World Cup winThis was supposed to be India's day in front of an enormous home crowd with their prime minister Narendra Modi, who this stadium is named after, up in the stands.Instead, it ended in crushing disappointment as Head produced one of the great World Cup knocks and Australia ran out surprise and comfortable winners.By the time 29-year-old Head reached his century, some in the vast stands had already made their exit, while seamer Mohammed Siraj was in tears at the end.Australia were contenders when this tournament began, without being tipped by many to go all of the way, just like when they won the 2021 T20 World Cup.Their campaign hit serious jitters early on with defeats in their opening two games, first by India and then South Africa, but they have won the title with nine consecutive victories, beating every team in the tournament in a row.At the end, their players, including England's old foes David Warner and Steve Smith, charged onto the field in celebration.Australia may have won it all before, but this ranks as one of their greatest nights.This video can not be playedKohli takes a good catch to dismiss Warner for sevenHead did not play in the first four games of Australia's campaign because of a broken hand, but Australia kept him in their squad, knowing the match-winning quality he possesses.He scored 109 in his first appearance against New Zealand but this innings was on another level as he first dealt with intense pressure before punishing the bowling.After his opening partner Warner nicked the first ball of the chase through the slips, Head crashed two boundaries to settle Australian nerves. Warner then edged a wide ball to slip for seven off Mohammed Shami, while Mitchell Marsh and Steve Smith both fell to the brilliant Jasprit Bumrah.The crowd was alive again at that stage, although Smith's lbw decision would have been overturned had he reviewed.Those wickets came in a manic opening period in which India took the upper hand but also gave up 15 extras in the powerplay alone, those in blue seemingly too eager to defend their low score.Batting became easier on a slow pitch that had offered more turn in the day, and Head took advantage. He cracked 14 fours and four sixes, with the sixes all pumped high over mid-wicket.On 99 he would have been run out as he scampered to three figures, had Ravindra Jadeja's throw hit from cover.He was finally out for 137, caught at deep mid-wicket attempting to finish in style. As he left the field he was embraced by Labuschagne and was congratulated by the Indians with the result already decided.This video can not be played'Stunned into silence' Kohli goes for 54 to CumminsHead's innings will take the headlines, but this victory was built on a sensational performance with the ball and a brave decision to bowl first at the toss by Pat Cummins.Captain Rohit Sharma gave India a rapid start with 47 from 31 balls, but from 76-1 in the 10th over, Australia applied a stranglehold on India's star-studded batting line-up and did not let go.Head played a crucial hand too, brilliantly catching Rohit as he ran back from cover, before Shreyas Iyer was caught behind off Cummins four balls later to leave the hosts 81-3.That left Virat Kohli and KL Rahul to attempt a rebuild, but the canny Australia bowlers kept the scoring to a crawl through a mix of short, slower balls and athletic fielding, all while captain Cummins mixed his pack to great effect.Kohli and Rahul put on 67 in 109 balls before the former captain played on to Cummins for 54 in the 29th over to leave the vast stadium stunned in silence. Rahul then nicked a beauty from Starc, ending any real hope of a significant India score.India's lower order had hardly been needed in this tournament, and when finally called upon, Ravindra Jadeja managed only nine and Suryakumar Yadav 18 with just four boundaries coming after the first 10 overs.India's worst performance with the bat came at the worst possible time in the tournament, but huge credit must go to Cummins and his champion attack.Australia captain Pat Cummins: ""We saved our best for last and a couple of big-match players stood up and we're pretty chuffed.""We were desperate in the field, I thought it all started against South Africa last week. The boys were fantastic. We've got an ageing squad but we are still throwing ourselves around. We were really chuffed with 240 because we were happy with anything under 300.""India captain Rohit Sharma: ""We were not good enough today but I'm really proud of the team and how we played from game one. We tried everything we could from our side but it wasn't supposed to be.""We were looking at 270 or 280 but then we kept losing wickets. We couldn't get a partnership together and that is exactly what Australia did to win the game, they stitched a good partnership after they lost three wickets.""Player of the match, Australia's Travis Head: ""Not in a million years did I think that would happen [being man of the match today and in the World Test Championship final]. What an amazing day. I'm just thrilled to be a part of it.""It is a lot better than being sat on the couch at home! I'm very lucky that everything went well and I was able to get back and the support that the boys showed, I didn't think this would happen. I was nervous in the first 20 balls but Marnus [Labuschagne] batted brilliantly and it is great to bat with him. It was an amazing partnership.""Former England bowler Steven Finn on BBC Test Match Special: ""Everything, from start to finish, that Australia did was outstanding.""They were truly outstanding in the field again. Australia were just on top from that moment that Travis Head caught Rohit Sharma and they never let India off the hook.""Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserPremier League predictions 2024-25: BBC Sport pundits pick their top fourConference League qualifying: Kilmarnock lead in Norway, St Mirren trailingThe air crash and the underdogs -  a triumph for a lost generationChloe Ayling was the victim no-one believedThe unbelievable true story of Chloe's kidnapping and the media frenzy that followedCan a werewolf, a vampire and a ghost live together?Comedy-drama starring Aidan Turner, Russell Tovey and Lenora CrichlowA dark web of secrets is about to be untangledWatch every episode of the tense thriller starring Jenna ColemanThe story of Manchester United's legendary Busby Babes.

Lyles wins sensational 100m gold by 0.005 seconds,"Lyles wins sensational 100m gold by 0.005 seconds  This video can not be playedLyles wins 100m gold for USA in thrilling finishUS sprint star Noah Lyles won the Olympic 100m title by five-thousandths of a second from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish at Paris 2024.Showman Lyles overhauled his rivals in the second half of the race to triumph by the finest of margins in a personal best 9.79 seconds.That was the same time as Olympic debutant Thompson, who led for most of the race, but Lyles produced a spectacular late charge to kick-start his bid for a potential four golds at these Games.The United States' former world champion Fred Kerley took bronze in 9.81, edging out South Africa's Akani Simbine for the podium.After a lengthy wait behind the start line to a backdrop of dramatic music in a frenzied atmosphere at Stade de France, all eight finalists finished within 0.12secs of Lyles in a remarkable race.Such was the standard of the final - which GB's Zharnel Hughes and Louie Hinchliffe failed to reach - Italy's reigning champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs was run out of the medals and another Jamaican rising star, Oblique Seville, finished last in 9.91.In the end it was Lyles, an athlete who thrives on the sport's grandest stages and who won three golds at last year's World Championships, who sprinted away in celebration once the official result appeared on the big screen.The 27-year-old repeatedly rang the victory bell by the side of the track after establishing himself at the pinnacle of the sport, before he targets further success in the 200m and relay events.""You couldn't have asked for a bigger moment,"" Lyles, who was seventh at the halfway stage, told BBC Sport.""I had to take every round as it was and I was a little upset after the first round, so I came with the aggression and... I ran 9.83 [in the semi-final].""I hope you guys like Noah because I've got a lot more coming!""Where the greatest Olympic 100m final was wonThis video can not be played'Couldn't have asked for a bigger moment' - Lyles reacts after 100m winLyles has remained outspoken and unflinching in his belief that he has the on-track ability and off-track aura to replace Usain Bolt as the new superstar of men's athletics.The American has talked the talk but he continues to back it up when it matters most.Lyles last year became the first man since Bolt in 2015 to win a 100m and 200m world double, before completing a golden treble in the 4x100m relay. Lyles claimed in the build-up to the Paris Games that he would look to add the 4x400m to that haul in the French capital, and he hinted at his form when running a 100m personal best at the London Diamond League last month.But repeating such success on these stages, under intense pressure - much of it self-imposed - is another thing entirely.He has now become the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004, and asserted himself as the dominant male sprinter of the current generation.A three-time reigning world 200m champion, he will look to maintain his grip on the sport's major titles in that event, which starts on Monday.Should he do so, he will move a step closer to sporting immortality in his pursuit of a historic four golds at these Games.This video can not be played'One of the greatest races ever' - Johnson, Lewis & Ennis-Hill react to 100m finalHinchliffe's fairytale rise from obscurity less than three months ago to an Olympic 100m debut was already a stunning achievement in its own right.But the 22-year-old and his coach Carl Lewis both said their goal was to make the final in Paris. When the Briton beat Lyles in a statement introduction in his heat on Saturday that appeared a realistic target.Even Lewis, with his vast experience as both a nine-time Olympic champion and coach at the University of Houston for the past decade, has been surprised by the remarkable rate of Hinchliffe's progress during their 12-month partnership.Unfortunately the final proved a step too far, with Hinchliffe run out of the non-automatic qualifying spots after finishing third behind Seville and Lyles in his semi-final.""It's obviously not the result I wanted but I can't be too hard on myself,"" Hinchliffe, already the sixth-fastest British man in history, told BBC Sport.""I'll definitely use this experience and I'll learn from my mistakes, so it is back to the drawing board and we'll work on it and come back stronger next year.”It also was not to be for Hughes, who could not set up the opportunity to replicate the breakthrough first global medal he achieved last year - or for Olympic redemption following his false start in the Tokyo final three years ago.The 29-year-old has not been able to hit the same heights of a 2023 season in which he broke two long-standing British records over 100m and 200m, after this campaign was disrupted by a hamstring injury.""Obviously I'm disappointed but I know where I am coming from. This is my third 100m. Not making any excuses. Today just wasn't my day,"" Hughes, who will also contest the 200m, said.""To try to get through the rounds of the Olympics after injuring my hamstring with a grade two tear last month wasn't that easy, but I dug deep to give myself a chance and that's what I came here to do.""This video can not be played'He has great speed endurance' - Johnson analyses Lyles' epic 100m winToday's Olympics guideFull Paris Olympics scheduleBBC's Paris Olympics TV scheduleComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserPremier League predictions 2024-25: BBC Sport pundits pick their top fourConference League qualifying: Kilmarnock lead in Norway, St Mirren trailingThe air crash and the underdogs -  a triumph for a lost generationChloe Ayling was the victim no-one believedThe unbelievable true story of Chloe's kidnapping and the media frenzy that followedCan a werewolf, a vampire and a ghost live together?Comedy-drama starring Aidan Turner, Russell Tovey and Lenora CrichlowA dark web of secrets is about to be untangledWatch every episode of the tense thriller starring Jenna ColemanThe story of Manchester United's legendary Busby Babes.

"Bobby Finke sets world record, wins gold in 1500-meter freestyle","U.S. swimmer Bobby Finke wins Olympic gold, sets record in 1,500-meter freestyle  Watch CBS News Updated on:  August 4, 2024 / 6:50 PM EDT           / AP         Bobby Finke won gold and set a world record in the 1,500-meter freestyle Sunday, giving the United States a huge boost on the final night of swimming at the Paris Olympics. But the giddiness was quickly erased when the Americans lost the men's 4x100 medley relay at the Summer Games for the first time.China stunned the U.S., which had won gold in the event at every Olympics other than the boycotted Moscow Games in 1980. The medley relay was added to the program in 1960.The winning team included Qin Haiyang and Sun Jiajun, who were both among the nearly two dozen swimmers who tested positive for a banned substance at the Tokyo Games but were allowed to compete. The result is sure to stir more hard feelings from other nations that feel the Chinese got away with cheating.But the real star of the Chinese team was Pan Zhanle, who had previously set a world record while winning the 100-meter freestyle and powered away from American Hunter Armstrong on the anchor leg to touch in 3 minutes, 27.46 seconds.The Americans had to settle for silver in 3:28.01, with France taking bronze in 3:28.38 to give Léon Marchand his fifth medal of the games to go along with four individual golds.Finke was under record pace the entire race and really turned it on coming to the finish. He touched in 14 minutes, 30.67 seconds to break the record of 14.31.02 set by China's Sun Yang at the 2012 London Games.The silver went to Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri in 14.34.55, while race favorite Daniel Wiffen of Ireland couldn't follow up his triumph in the 800 freestyle. He was never a factor and settled for the bronze in 14:39.63, barely holding off Hungary's David Betlehem for the final spot on the podium.Finke set the third swimming world record of these Olympics and provided a much-needed jolt for the mighty American team, which leads the overall medal count but had endured a series of disappointing results from some of its biggest swimmers.Finke's gold was the seventh for the U.S., pulling them into a tie with Australia for the top spot in that column.The two nations were expected to battle for the decisive gold in the final event at La Defense Arena, with Australia coming in as the defending Olympic champion.Sarah Sjöström of Sweden claimed her second gold medal of the Paris Olympics, furiously dashing from one end of the pool to the other to easily claim the 50-meter freestyle title on the final night of swimming Sunday.The 30-year-old Sjöström, competing in her fifth Summer Games, had already won the 100 free — an event in which she holds the world record but only decided to swim at the urging of her coach.She was more surprised than anyone with that victory, which had her overflowing with confidence heading into the 50 free.Sjöström touched in 23.71 seconds, just shy of the world record of 23.61 she set at the 2023 world championships in Fukuoka, Japan. In a race that's usually decided by a hundredths of a second, the Swedish star turned this into a relative blowout. She was fastest off the block and clearly in control by the midway point of the single lap.Meg Harris of Australia took the silver in 23.97, while the bronze went to China's Zhang Yufei in 24.20. For Zhang, one of the swimmers implicated in a Chinese doping scandal, it was her fourth bronze of the games to go with a silver.Gretchen Walsh of the United States just missed out on her fourth medal of the games, touching fourth in 24.21. © 2024 The Associated Press.

Holding the South Korean flag, with Ben Davies and Archie Gray by his side, he walks into a lightning storm of camera flashes, fascination and love.Son Heung-min is home.Three days on from Son and Tottenham Hotspur’s arrival in Seoul, club legend Ossie Ardiles reflects on the forward’s fame here.“The only one thing I can compare it to was when Diego arrived in Argentina,” says Ardiles, who is on Tottenham’s summer tour in his role as a club ambassador. “Not just Argentina, but anywhere when he was at the top of his game. That’s the only comparison that I can make.”Diego, of course, is Diego Maradona and there is something in that comparison, despite the wildly different personalities. Son’s fame has different energies to it, but — as with Maradona before him — there is deeper affection felt for him than is typically true for professional athletes.Son’s image is not really overbearing in Seoul. His face is not plastered on every billboard nor does it lean out from the plasma screens at the top of the city’s high-rises. He is a brand and you do not have to walk far to find his likeness, but there is never a sense of being pummelled by those endorsements. Nor, actually, do the streets of Seoul swim in replica shirts bearing his name; on matchdays there are plenty, but you can go days without seeing one.A short walk from Gangnam, one of the wealthiest areas in Seoul, Son recently opened a new branch of NOS7, his lifestyle brand. It is not in a part of town with much footfall, nor are small armies of fans leading pilgrimages towards it. The shop itself is like something down a Knightsbridge side street. There is no feverish devotion to be found when The Athletic visits, only shoppers musing thoughtfully under fashionable downlighting.AdvertisementIt is a useful experience because it corrects some of the assumptions about Son and the way he is viewed in his home country. The expectation was for an orgy of merchandise and fistfights over whatever happened to be left on the shelves. Maybe there are places like that, but the ambience of Son’s store seems to better reflect how he is regarded. Son is not a cult. He is cherished, clearly, and his arrival at the airport made that point. But the dynamic is less urgent, more sincere.Shoot for Love is a South Korean football YouTube channel that took part in an event Tottenham staged with the Make A Wish foundation during the tour. Babamba, one of its hosts, described the country’s relationship with Son, depicting it as more than just fan worship.“His talent, of course, is just fantastic,” he tells The Athletic. “But then so is the way he deals with the press and how he interacts with his fellow players. He has this energy that reaches out to fans and so he is a source of national pride beyond football.“He is something more to us than a player. Even if you are not a football fan, you do know who he is and the impact he’s making. So yeah — he means a lot.”Son is the finest footballer in South Korean history and the finest player Asia has ever produced. That his star has shone so brightly in the Premier League, which is so globally significant, makes him a figure of great national significance. South Koreans take pride in that prominence, but — certainly in every conversation The Athletic has had here — his qualities as a person are given as much weight as his talents as a football player.He is humble. He is seen as intelligent and respectful. His private life is truly private and without scandal. That is a rare combination in any athlete or celebrity. For one from South Korea, where few stars graduate to the world stage, it is especially potent. In a way, it is something of a virtuous popularity cycle.AdvertisementSon is loved for who he is and then admired for how he copes with that attention. The fiercer the attention becomes, the deeper the respect gets.At the Seoul World Cup stadium, the day before Tottenham’s friendly against Team K-League, a select side from the domestic league, Son was the star attraction at the pre-match press conference. It really is something to watch him in that environment. As he took his seat alongside Ange Postecoglou, dozens of cameras flashed, bathing him in a fierce strobe that would have left most of us shielding our eyes. Son barely blinked. This was normal. As were the photographers who jostled for position, or clicked their cameras any time he laughed or smiled or showed a particular side of his face.He is handsome, that does not hurt, either. The Korean media does not seem aggressive or disrespectful with their questioning — there was no prying into his personal life. But there is still a quiet grace to Son in those moments and in the way he bears the spotlight. He says the right thing, always. He is respectful, always.Most people find that a challenge during their everyday life. There are coaches in the Premier League currently unable to navigate an interview without a surly comment or flash of ego. Son never so much as dips a toe in those waters — and it would only be human to sometimes feel that strain or the expectation that comes with his identity.During the tour, different team-mates talk about those challenges. Ben Davies, to whom Son is closest, tells stories about sneaking him out in public wearing baseball caps.“That must be so tough,” Davies told The Athletic. “We probably can’t even relate to how challenging it is.”GO DEEPERFrom Godfather Son to never being late - Ben Davies' lessons from 10 years at SpursLedley King, the former Tottenham captain who is now a club ambassador, has been on the tour, too. He is getting used to the spectacle, but it is still unique.“When we came out two years ago, we had our first real look at what it’s like for Sonny in his home country. You got used to it a little bit, but I can’t imagine what it would be like.Advertisement“I compare it to when I played for England and we had David Beckham. That was probably the closest thing.”While there is certainly a clamour around Son, the mania is not the same as it often was for Beckham. It is not as aggressive, nor as grabby. Nor does it have the same energy as exists around Korean K-Pop stars, whose likenesses seem more common around Seoul. It’s not that they are more famous, more that they are famous in a different way.The girl group TWICE performed during half-time of the game against Team K-League. When they stormed onto the pitch at the break, surrounded by an accompanying band and a rainbow of lighting effects, the noise from the crowd was quite different to anything heard at any other point of the night.They are idols. Son is something else, even if none of the South Koreans The Athletic speaks to in Seoul can quite agree on the appropriate word. Role model. Example. Icon. Hero. Those words come up several times. In the hours before that Team K-League match, fans crowd around the stadium and into the pop-up shops Tottenham have erected for the occasion. There’s an inflatable cockerel, too, and after posing in front of it with her son, a woman briefly stops to talk to The Athletic.“I like how he is with the children,” she says, showing a video on her phone of Son interacting with mascots before Premier League games.“He is so good. We are so proud.”Like her son, she is wearing this season’s Tottenham shirt. Both have Son’s name and number on the back.Fans in Seoul celebrate Son Heung-min’s first goal last night. pic.twitter.com/gO1plhoKSL— Seb Stafford-Bloor (@SebSB) August 1, 2024And what is Tottenham’s role in this? Have they become entwined with a nation’s affections or will that change once Son’s playing career finishes? Different people have different perspectives. Some have real affection for the club and want to talk about new signings and hopes for the season. A quirk of Son’s fame is that even British journalists who cover him are extremely well-known in South Korea and are frequently stopped for pictures and conversations. Others cheerfully acknowledge that they buy shirts and come to games purely to watch Son. And there are many in-between, too, who do not seem in a hurry to sort out what they think about Spurs, or who have plenty of interest in Lee Kang-in’s Paris Saint-Germain or, in greater numbers, Kim Min-jae’s Bayern Munich.AdvertisementSimon Chadwick is professor of sport and geopolitical economy at Skema Business School in Paris. He sees Son’s off-field value as a “happy accident” for Spurs.“Son was signed because he represented good value for money and not because someone inside the club believed he would become a highly lucrative, global superstar,” Professor Chadwick tells The Athletic.“It could easily have been the case that he failed to settle, went on loan or headed back to German football. Instead, there was a serendipitous alignment of a player who developed better than people imagined, a guy who proved to be eloquent and well-behaved, brands who saw that he could potentially engage new audiences, and a stable home nation reporting healthy economic growth figures.”It might be impossible to say what the permanence of that situation is, but has it created long-term bonds that will survive beyond Son’s career?“Son has been instrumental in building some engagement with South Korean fans and hence it seems that in, say, 2050, there will still be a hardcore of Tottenham fans across the country.“However, by then, attempts to cultivate the market and generate long-term value are likely to have long gone. Football clubs tend to lurch from one short-term opportunity to another. It could be South Korea, but it could also be Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Brazil or wherever else in the world that is proving to be lucrative at any given point in time.“As for what Son leaves behind, deeper and broader engagement with the Premier League is likely to become apparent. However, this competitive advantage can be transient, as European clubs are increasingly aggressive in their competition for overseas markets. Neither Tottenham nor the Premier League should make any assumptions about the long-term sustainability of their current positions.”AdvertisementIn January 2025, the brightest footballing light in Asia, Yang Min-hyuk will also join Tottenham. He has an uncannily similar technical profile to Son. He is a two-footed, dynamic forward, who potentially represents something of a transfer coup for the club.There will be plenty of interest in him, of course, much of it from Asia. But at just 18, he has nothing like the status in the game enjoyed by Son, nor is there any certainty that his personality will enrapture people in the same way.It would be fine if it does not because Son Heung-min is rare. And that is really the detail to pause on. He is more than a footballer, in his home country and well beyond its borders. It will take more than a footballer to replace him at Tottenham, too, and that really does emphasise what a happy union this has been.And how unlikely it is to happen again.(Top photo: Han Myung-Gu/Getty Images)Subscribe to The Athletic for in-depth coverage of your favorite players, teams, leagues and clubs.

Taiwan-China's uneasy rivalry spills to badminton court,"Political rivals. Badminton adversaries. What to know about Taiwan-China  PARIS − Badminton is a hugely popular sport in both Taiwan and China. At the Paris Olympics, two incidents in as many days involving the sport's spectators reflects those place's uneasy rivalry on the world stage.A Taiwan badminton supporter who was holding up a sign that read, ""Let’s go Taiwan,"" had it ripped from her hands and torn up Sunday during the men's doubles badminton final. Wang Chi-Lin and Lee Yang of Taiwan beat China's Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang in a three-game thriller to win the gold medal in the event. A towel with a similar sentiment was also stolen off a Taiwan fan during the match, according to reports.The incidents prompted Taiwan’s government on Monday to call on French authorities to launch an investigation. It followed a separate report on Friday that saw a spectator who was holding up a green banner that read, ""Taiwan go for it,"" removed from a Paris badminton venue during Taiwan player Chou Tien Chen's match against India’s Lakshya Sen.Here's what to know about Taiwan and China at the Olympics.China's government has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since a civil war in China in the 1940s, when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists lost to Mao Zedong’s Communists and rebased their government in Taiwan. Beijing uses its global clout today to require that the International Olympic Committee let Taiwan, known internationally as an island-territory, join Olympic events only as ""Chinese Taipei"" because the label implies a link to China.2024 Paris Olympics: Follow USA TODAY’s coverage of the biggest names and stories of the Games.Instead of Taiwan's official banner, its Olympic athletes wear a white-colored Chinese Taipei flag on their uniforms. It features a five-petal flower encircled by the Olympic rings. Taiwan's flag anthem is banned from Olympic Games. On Sunday, for only the second time in Olympic history − the other time was at the Tokyo Summer Olympics − Taiwans's flag anthem was played during the medals ceremony. Crucially, however, the anthem's lyrics were changed for the performance so as not to upset China. It's not clear if the ceremony was broadcast in China.Yes, Taiwan is in the Olympics:What that means for island's Winter GamesInternational Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said in a press conference Monday that there were ""clear rules,"" drafted in 1981, governing Taiwan's participation as Chinese Taipei. He also noted that spectators are not permitted to bring banners to Olympic events. ""You can see how this can lead into: 'If that's allowed then why not this?' That is why the rules are quite strict. We have to try to bring 206 national Olympic committees together in one place. It is quite a tough ask,"" he said. The Badminton World Federation did not respond to a comment request.Green, the color of the stolen towel, is associated with Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party. The DDP has sought to transition Taiwan toward full independence from China, leading to increasing military threats from Beijing.",True,False,False

A slip on the balance beam and penalties on the floor cost Simone Biles another gold medal,"A slip on the balance beam and penalties on the floor cost Simone Biles another gold medal                    Simone Biles slipped off the balance beam and incurred costly penalties on the floor as she failed to win a gold medal for the first time at these Summer Olympics in Paris – which have been serving as an emphatic comeback from disappointment three years ago in Tokyo.                  In the individual beam final, Biles lost her balance and fell off the apparatus, costing her a chance to make even more history here in France. Alice D’Amato of Italy took home the gold, Zhou Yaqin of China took silver and Italian Manila Esposito took the bronze.                  Later in the floor final, Biles appeared to have put together another stunning performance on an apparatus on which she has excelled here in Paris. But two moments of landing out of bounds cost Biles six-tenths of a point, enough to bring her score down to 14.133 behind gold medalist Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, who scored a 14.166.      Related article Simone Biles says this gymnast ‘scares’ her the most out of all her competitors              It’s a slightly disappointing end to an incredible Games for the American legend. Biles, already the most decorated gymnast of all time, put her name next to a few more records last week when she won the gold in the team event with Team USA, the individual all-around competition and the vault final.                  With those wins, Biles became the most decorated American Olympic gymnast of all time – now with 11 total Olympic medals, including seven gold – and also became the oldest American gymnast to win a gold medal at 27.                  While it wasn’t the result she wanted, Biles is not walking away from Paris disappointed.                  “I accomplished way more than my wildest dreams – not just at this Olympics, but in this sport,” Biles told reporters afterward. “So I can’t be mad at my performances. A couple years ago, I didn’t think I’d be back here at an Olympic Games, so competing and then walking away with four medals, I’m not mad about it. I’m pretty proud of myself.”                  She had a chance to tie another incredible mark if she had won both the beam and the floor exercises on Monday. The only two women to ever win nine Olympic gold medals are American swimmer Katie Ledecky and Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina. Biles will have to wait until Los Angeles in 2028 if she wants to try and reach that mark.                  It was a tough day on the beam overall for many as multiple competitors fell, including Biles’ Team USA teammate Sunisa Lee.                  Lee lost her footing during her routine and slipped, landing with the beam between her legs before tipping over onto the mat on her side. She would end up finishing in sixth place, one spot behind Biles.                  Unlike Biles, the 2020 gold medalist in the all-around won’t get another chance on Monday to redeem herself. The beam was Lee’s last competition here in Paris.                  “It was a lot of pressure. It was just crazy to see how everybody was going down like that,” Lee said after. “You could feel the tension in the room. The crowd shushing us for cheering. We didn’t like that as it was just so silent in there. I love hearing my teammates cheer for me.”                  Biles added that it was a weird beam final and that the silence in the arena – marked by some shushing from the crowd when the gymnasts tried to cheer on their teammates – was a little unsettling. She said she and other gymnasts have previously asked for music to be piped in during the beam finals, but have been denied.                  “I don’t know. It was really weird and awkward,” Biles said. “And we’ve asked several times if we can have some music or some background noise, so I’m not really sure what happened there. But yeah, not our favorite. None of us liked it.”                  The moment marked a massive test for Biles later on Monday when she took on the floor final.                  Throughout these Olympics, Biles has emphasized what a key role her mentality has played in bouncing back from disappointment in Tokyo. She acknowledged after the team final that thoughts of her withdrawal from those events three years ago were lingering as she began her vault for Team USA.                  Biles, who has talked about the importance of taking care of her mental health during these Games after each of her golden performances, has said she’s speaking with her therapist every morning before competition and religiously every Thursday.                  “After all these years of putting in the mental work in, it’s paid off,” Biles said Saturday after winning her latest gold.                  She added, “The Olympics is such a draining process for the athletes. It’s multiple days of competitions, so you definitely have to be on top of your mental as well as your physical [health].”                  Her routine was full of the power and grace that Biles has made her trademark. Her speed and the torque on her spins were incredible and her flips made her appear to be floating on air. But all that power and speed had a side-effect as the American on two occasions had to step out of bounds in order to catch her footing, incurring those costly penalties.                  When she finished, Biles looked to have done more than enough to pip Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade to the gold medal. Andrade’s total score was far below the performances that Biles had been turning in on the floor during her appearances earlier in the competition and, if the American performed to her usual standard, then she was a shoo-in for gold.                  But those few tiny stumbles were just enough to give the Brazilian her second Olympic gold medal. Andrade had pushed and pushed Biles throughout these Paris Games, in the individual all-around competition and the vault final in which the American took home the Olympic title.                  After Thursday night’s all-around final, Biles said she loved competing against the Brazilian, but Andrade was getting “too close.”                  “I don’t want to compete with Rebeca no more. I’m tired,” Biles said at the time. “She’s way too close. I’ve never had an athlete that close, so it definitely put me on my toes, and it brought up the best athlete in myself, so I’m excited and proud to compete with her but … it was uncomfortable, guys. I was stressing.”                  Biles seemed to take the disappointment in stride – her and bronze medalist Jordan Chiles bowed before the Brazilian after the competition, hailing her as the new queen of the floor.                  “She’s so amazing. She’s queen,” Biles said of Andrade on Monday. “And first it was an all-Black podium, so that was super exciting for us. But then Jordan was like, ‘Should we bow to her?’ And I was like, ‘Absolutely.’ So we’re like, ‘Are we gonna do it now?’ And then, that’s why we did it.                  “But she’s, she’s such an excitement to watch. And then all the fans in the crowd always cheering for her. So it was just the right thing to do. She’s sweet.”                  Chiles said she wanted to make sure that Andrade got the praise that she felt the Brazilian deserved and that the new gold medalist is one of the kinder competitors to go up against.                  “You know, she’s an icon, a legend herself,” Chiles said. “So I feel like being recognized is what everybody should do when it comes to somebody who’s put in the work, put in the dedication. So yeah, in that moment, I was like … first off, again, yes, it was an all-Black podium. Second off, why don’t we just give her flowers? She’s given, you know, not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us on, in the United States our flowers as well, so giving it back is what makes it so beautiful. So I felt like it was needed.”                  Chiles herself only just got on the medal stand in another dramatic twist. After her routine, she was awarded a score of 13.666, putting her in fifth place. But then she challenged the judges’ score and her difficulty marks were increased by .1 points, enough to move her over Romania’s Ana Bărbosu for the final spot on the podium.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beaten in Wimbledon quarterfinals by Daniil Medvedev after needing medical assessment in third set,"World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beaten in Wimbledon quarterfinals by Daniil Medvedev after needing medical assessment in third set                    World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has been knocked out of Wimbledon after losing his quarterfinal match against Russian Daniil Medvedev in five sets Tuesday.                  Medvedev, the No. 5 seed, advances to his second Wimbledon semifinal with a 6-7 (9-7) 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 2-6 6-3 victory and is aiming to win his second grand slam after his success at the 2021 US Open.     A new generation of tennis stars has begun to emerge over the last couple of years, and Italy's Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner is one of them. He recently made it to the top of the ATP rankings, and he told CNN's Amanda Davies how it feels.  Related video ATP Tour: Jannik Sinner ascends to top of world rankings              Sinner, who rose to the top of the men’s tennis rankings after the French Open, had previously won the five past meetings against Medvedev. That included the Australian Open final earlier this year, when Sinner won his first grand slam title after coming back from two sets down.                  Play was paused during their quarterfinal when Sinner, who looked unwell and had his pulse taken, left the court for a medical assessment when he was down a break in the third set after three games. The pair had split the first two sets.                  There was what appeared to be a look of concern on the face of Sinner’s coach, Darren Cahill.                  Following Sinner’s return after the timeout, the Italian would go on to break back, but it was Medvedev who took the third set tiebreak and a two-sets-to-one lead.                  Sinner refused to go quietly, forcing a fifth set, but an early break by Medvedev gave the momentum back to the Russian.                  Meanwhile, reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz won his 12th consecutive match at the grass court grand slam, defeating Tommy Paul in four sets.                  The American Paul took an early lead over the world No. 3 - earning the opening set 7-5 and went up a break in the following set - but was ultimately pegged back by the Spaniard.                  The 21-one-year old Alcaraz grew stronger as the match carried on - a staple of his success – winning the match 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-2.                  “I had to stay strong mentally at the beginning when I lost the first set,” Alcaraz said afterwards.                  “It was kinda difficult for me a little bit but I know it is a really long journey. I am really happy to find the solutions and the good path.”                  With his victory, Alcaraz advanced to the tournament’s semifinals and will face Medvedev on Friday. The pair played each other in the same round last year at Wimbledon with Alcaraz winning in straight sets.                  Alcaraz, who won the French Open in June, advances to his sixth semifinal in his last seven majors.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

No last hurrah for Andy Murray at Wimbledon after Emma Raducanu withdraws from mixed doubles competition,"No last hurrah for Andy Murray at Wimbledon after Emma Raducanu withdraws from mixed doubles competition                    There will be no last hurrah for Andy Murray at Wimbledon after his playing partner and fellow Briton, Emma Raducanu, withdrew from the mixed doubles event.                  Murray and Raducanu had been scheduled to play their first match together on Saturday, but the 2021 US Open winner said she was withdrawing after waking up with “some stiffness” in her right wrist.                  “I’m disappointed as I was really looking forward to playing with Andy but got to take care,” the 21-year-old Raducanu said in a statement.                  It means that 37-year-old Murray has played his last match at Wimbledon after announcing earlier this year he will retire from tennis this season.                  Raducanu, who has dealt with her own share of injuries since winning the US Open three years ago, is set to face qualifier Lulu Sun in the women’s singles for a place in her first quarterfinals at Wimbledon.                  After recently undergone a surgical procedure to address a spinal cyst, Murray was unable to play in the singles tournament at Wimbledon, though he did compete in the doubles alongside his brother, Jamie, with the pair losing in straight sets to John Peers and Rinky Hijikata on Thursday.                  Following the defeat, Murray – a two-time winner at Wimbledon – was moved to tears after a short ceremony on Centre Court in which a montage of his career played out on big screens.                  “It is hard because I would love to keep playing, but I can’t. Physically, it’s just too tough now,” Murray said in his interview on court, after watching the video.                  “I want to play forever, I love the sport. It’s given me so much, taught me loads of lessons over the years that I can use in the rest of my life. I don’t want to stop, so it is hard.”                  Grand slam champions Novak Djokovic, Iga Świątek, Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe were just some of the famous faces in attendance for the short ceremony, and they joined thousands of fans in giving Murray a standing ovation.                  Murray’s family, including his two young daughters, also watched on from the stands.                  Murray has become a legend at Wimbledon ever since making his debut at the tournament as a teenager in 2005.                  Murray made his first Wimbledon singles final in 2012 where he lost to Roger Federer – a defeat which moved the British star to tears and somewhat changed the public’s perception of him.                  A month later, Murray was back on the same court to win a gold medal at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. The victory kickstarted a successful year for Murray a he went on to wins the US Open – his first grand slam title.                  He then returned to Wimbledon in 2013 where he ended Britain’s 77-year wait for a men’s singles champion – an incredible moment now etched into the country’s history. In 2016, Murray won his second Wimbledon title – a victory which he says was his favorite.                  However, hit by injuries in recent seasons, Murray has struggled to be competitive.                  He has previously said that if his body allows, the Paris Olympics will be his final competition before retiring from the sport.

American League tops National League for 10th time in last 11 MLB All-Star Games,"American League tops National League for 10th time in last 11 MLB All-Star Games  By Kevin Dotson, CNN(CNN) — Major League Baseball’s Midsummer Classic returned to Arlington, Texas, for the first time since 1995 on Tuesday as the American League defeated the National League 5-3 to win the 2024 All-Star Game.Pittsburgh Pirates rookie sensation Paul Skenes started the game for the National League, becoming the first rookie pitcher to start in an All-Star game in nearly 30 years. He pitched a scoreless first inning, allowing one batter to reach on a walk and inducing a groundout from MLB home run leader Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees to end the inning.Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers got the scoring started in the third inning with a three-run homer off Boston Red Sox pitcher Tanner Houck to give the NL a 3-0 lead.But the American League answered right back with a two-run double from the Yankees’ Juan Soto and an RBI single from the Cleveland Guardians’ David Fry to tie the game 3-3 after three innings.The American League took a 5-3 lead in the fifth inning with a two-run blast from Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Hunter Greene. The National League couldn’t muster an answer, and Cleveland’s Emmanuel Clase closed the door in the ninth inning to earn the save.Oakland Athletics fireballer Mason Miller picked up the win for the AL behind a perfect fifth inning that included strikeouts of Ohtani and Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner.Duran’s game-winning big fly earned him MVP honors, putting the outfielder in stellar company with baseball legends.According to MLB, Duran said postgame: “I didn’t think about that. That’s a great list of names to be a part of. I think I’m just thankful to be able to play in the All-Star Game and for the Red Sox, and to represent them well. It’s just – I don’t know, it’s a surreal moment. So I’m just thankful to be here.“I’m definitely not thinking I’m the best of the best. I’m a guy that keeps my head down and just works hard. There’s so many good players in this league. I’m just thankful that I can play against these guys.“I’m just very thankful. It’s hard to put into words. It won’t hit me until I try to go to sleep tonight. Who knows if I’ll be able to sleep tonight,” he added.The American League has now won 10 of the last 11 All-Star Games dating back to 2013.The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

LeBron James leads Team USA to another comeback in 92-88 win against Germany,"LeBron James leads Team USA to another comeback in 92-88 win against Germany                    The USA men’s basketball team had to stage another fourth quarter comeback during its preparations for the Olympic Games as it eked past Germany, 92-88.                  Following Saturday’s last-gasp victory against South Sudan, the USA were forced to once again fight deep into the game – this time against a determined Germany team.                  But some things never change, and yet again it was LeBron James who put on a late show to lead Team USA to a fifth win out of five during the USA Basketball Showcase.                  In front of a sold-out O2 Arena in southeast London, the US got off to a flying start and looked determined to improve on its performance in its previous game.                  There were 19,177 fans in attendance to witness some of the sport’s greatest stars with a cacophony of colors from jerseys from all around the world on display.      Related article LeBron James to be Team USA’s male flag bearer for Olympic Opening Ceremony              And the crowd didn’t have to wait too long to get off their seats.                  Getting the scoring underway was none other than ‘King James’ and he did so in typical fashion. On a fast break, the four-time MVP rose up to throw down a thunderous dunk to get the crowd going.                  The highlight reel plays didn’t stop there and just moments later the crowd witnessed another James dunk. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar slammed in an alley-oop from a pass by Boston Celtics guard Jrue Holiday and the crowd rose to their feet once more.                  The US took a 29-19 lead after the first quarter and the game looked to be heading only one way.                  Germany tried to rally back in the second, but Team USA ended the quarter strongly. The crowd again went wild when James emphatically blocked a Dennis Schröder layup before Steph Curry hit a three at the opposite end – a scene basketball fans once thought they could only dream of.                  The new American kids on the block then decided to join the party.                  With time in the half running out, new Team USA member Joel Embiid put up a huge block before first-time Olympian Anthony Edwards raced down the floor. ‘Ant-Man’ then went airborne as he took off and slammed it home.                  The four-time defending Olympic gold medalists headed into the break with the momentum and a 48-41 lead.                  Coming out of the halftime interval Germany seemed keen to not let the game follow the same script as the first half, and an incredible third quarter propelled the Europeans into the lead.                  Germany fans also seemed rejuvenated after the break and cheered every point, rebound and hustle from the team in red – creating a cauldron-like atmosphere inside the arena.                  Germany outscored the USA 30-20 in the third and went into the fourth quarter with a slender 71-68 lead.                  But as he has done throughout his career, James stepped up in the clutch.                  The NBA’s all-time leading scorer put up 11 points in the fourth to take his team to victory and continue the squad’s unbeaten streak in the buildup to Paris.      Related article Team USA survives scare in Olympic warmup, scraping past South Sudan 101-100              James scored a game-high 20 points to go along with six rebounds and four assists in another special performance from the Los Angeles Lakers star.                  “Somebody named LeBron James made some pretty good plays at the end,” Germany head coach Gordon Herbert said when summing up the result to reporters postgame.                  While the US won, it was far from a vintage performance, but James noted the team’s improvements on the night.                  “We got better tonight and that’s most important,” the Lakers star told reporters postgame. “We was tested by a great Germany team, they was world champion last year, so it was a good test for us.                  “I’m glad we was able to, once again, keep our composure, persevere like we did the other day versus South Sudan. It was a good win for us.”                  The USA will be hoping these improvements continue to come as they head into the Olympics in Paris.                  The first game for the US will be against Serbia on July 28 before facing South Sudan and Puerto Rico in the remaining group stage games.                  The US men’s team has won gold at the last four Olympics and will be looking to make it five in a row in Paris.     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

"Red Bull suspends female employee who accused team principal Christian Horner of inappropriate behavior, per reports","Red Bull suspends female employee who accused team principal Christian Horner of inappropriate behavior, per reports                    Red Bull has suspended the female employee who accused F1 team principal Christian Horner of inappropriate behavior, according to multiple reports.                  Speaking with reporters in Jeddah ahead of this weekend’s Saudi Arabia Grand Prix, Horner said he couldn’t talk about the reported suspension due to “confidentiality restrictions.”      Related article ‘He is not a liar:’ Max Verstappen defends his outspoken father amid Christian Horner controversy              When contacted by CNN, a Red Bull spokesperson said: “We are unable to comment on this internal matter.”                  Red Bull launched an independent investigation in February after Horner was accused of engaging in inappropriate behavior towards a member of the racing team, who has not been identified.                  Horner was cleared of wrongdoing last week and later reiterated that he denied the allegations after alleged leaked messages were distributed to members of the F1 community in a Google Drive. CNN has been unable to corroborate their authenticity and Red Bull said it would be “inappropriate” to comment on the matter.                  “The reality is that there was a grievance that was raised, it was dealt with in the most professional manner by the group, not by Red Bull Racing but by the owners of Red Bull GMBH, that appointed an independent KC, that is one of the most reputable KC’s in the land,” Horner said.                  “He took time to investigate fully all of the facts, he interviewed all of the people involved together with others of interest.                  “He looked at everything, he had all of the facts, and he came to a conclusion where he dismissed the grievance. As far as I’m concerned, as far as Red Bull is concerned, we move on.”                  Media speculation that three-time F1 world champion Max Verstappen could leave Red Bull Racing has arisen, after his father Jos Verstappen called for Horner’s sacking following the allegations. Max Verstappen later defended his outspoken father for speaking out.                  “I’m obviously aware of the comments that were made,” Horner said. “There was a comment, there was a discussion subsequent to the race and I think everybody’s focus is very much on the future.”                  Horner added that he expects Verstappen will see out his contract with the team through 2028.                  ”I’m certain that he will (see out his contract),” Horner said.                  “He’s got a great team around him. He’s got great faith in that team. And we’ve achieved an awful lot together, so he’s committed to an agreement until 2028.                  “From a team side, from Max’s side, we’re determined to build on the success that we’ve achieved already and those 55 victories have all come in Red Bull cars.”                  The controversy around Horner has stolen almost all the headlines as the new season rolls onto its second race weekend.                  Zak Brown, McLaren Racing’s chief executive, told CNN’s Amanda Davies that it was “very unfortunate” the saga was continuing and said more “transparency” is needed in the process in order for people to be satisfied with the outcome.                  Admitting it was hard to comment directly on the Horner case, given he doesn’t know the full details, Brown said McLaren would have suspended the individual while they were under investigation if something similar had happened in their team.                  He also said the sport’s governing body, the FIA, needs to be sure the matter is handled appropriately in order to not damage the reputation of the sport.                  “I do think this is an isolated incident involving one team, a couple individuals, and so I think we need to see it as that, as opposed to a wider issue with Formula 1,” Brown said.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Tearful Coco Gauff exits Paris Olympics singles competition after controversial umpire call,"Tearful Coco Gauff exits Paris Olympics singles competition after controversial umpire call        Coco Gauff looked to be cruising against Donna Vekić in her third-round singles match at the Paris Olympics. Then, all of a sudden, she wasn’t.                  Having been a point away from taking the first set at Roland Garros, Gauff had to watch the contest slip away from her, eventually succumbing to a 7-6(7) 6-2 upset defeat on Court Philippe-Chatrier.                  The most fraught moment of the match came midway through the second set when Gauff was reduced to tears during a heated exchange with chair umpire Jaume Campistol.                  A line call on Gauff’s baseline was initially deemed out, but Campistol overruled the decision and handed Vekić a crucial break point. Play was then paused as the American vehemently argued that the point should be replayed as the call was made just before she hit the ball.                  The supervisor also came onto the court and the ensuing debate lasted five minutes, with Gauff wiping tears away from her eyes. Boos and jeers came from the crowd when play was eventually resumed.                  “There’s been multiple times this year where that happened to me, where I feel like I always have to be an advocate for myself on the court,” she later told reporters.                  “And I feel like in tennis, we should have a VR [video review] system because these points are big deals. Usually, afterwards, they apologize, so it’s kind of frustrating when the sorry doesn’t help you once the match is over.”                  Gauff immediately created three break points the following game, but Vekić shut down the opening, saving the last point with an inch-perfect lob before taking a 4-2 lead in the second set.                  The match was firmly in the Croatian’s control from that point, and she closed out the contest to set up a quarterfinal meeting with either Greece’s Maria Sakkari or Ukraine’s Marta Kostyuk.                  “Donna played well,” said Gauff. “She’s been playing well throughout Wimbledon ‘til now, so I knew it would be a tough match. I think I had a lot of chances in the first, and I felt like if I could clinch that set, it might have helped me in the momentum of the second.”      Related article Olympic gold in tennis faces tough competition from injuries, illnesses and dreams of grand slam glory              The match was played in the baking midday sun with temperatures expected to reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) in Paris, though adding in the humidity, the heat index was 104 degrees F (40 degrees C) – easily the hottest day of the Olympics so far.                  On Court Philippe-Chatrier, sun hats and hand-held fans were out in force, and an automated stadium announcement between games reminded spectators to drink water and take regular breaks from the heat.                  Gauff, the world No. 2 and a strong pre-tournament contender to medal in the women’s singles event, stormed into an early first-set lead, but after seeing a set point saved by Vekić, she lost her break advantage when a forehand drifted wide.                  As the set wore on, Vekić played the shot of the match at that point, pushing a smash back past her opponent. But Gauff responded in similar fashion the following game, returning a Vekić smash with a well-timed backhand while her opponent was stranded at the net.                  Both players had set points in the tie-break, but it was Vekić who capitalized on the opportunity, raising her level when it mattered to take a one-set lead in more than an hour.                  Vekić, a semifinalist at Wimbledon earlier this month, lost an early break with a double fault at the start of the second set, but she managed to take the next five games in a row and wrap up the victory in brutal conditions.                  “It was very, very tough out there, the conditions, when we warmed up this morning and the roof was closed,” Vekić told reporters. “It took me a couple of games to adjust; it was very hot. The ball was flying a little bit, but after that, I got in rhythm and it was pretty good.”                  The dispute with the umpire in the second set, Gauff later explained, didn’t alter the result of the match.                  “I’m not going to sit here and say one point affected the result today because I was already on the losing side of things before that point happened,” she said.                  The 20-year-old, a flag bearer for Team USA at the opening ceremony, still has mixed and women’s doubles competitions to come in Paris having won her opening match in the latter alongside Jessica Pegula on Saturday.     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Audi suspends Daniel Abt after gamer raced under Formula E driver’s name in esports event,"Audi suspends Daniel Abt after gamer raced under Formula E driver’s name in esports event        Formula E driver Daniel Abt has been suspended by his Audi team for using a professional esports gamer to compete for him.                  Abt had been taking part in the ‘Race at Home Challenge’ which raised funds for the UNICEF coronavirus relief fund.                  After being found not to have driven his car himself in the qualifying and fifth race of the series on Saturday, May 23, Abt apologized and was disqualified from the race as well as being fined 10,000 euros ($10,956).                  Audi has now suspended the driver “with immediate effect.”                  “Integrity, transparency and consistent compliance with applicable rules are top priorities for Audi – this applies to all activities the brand is involved in without exception,” Audi said in a statement.      READ: Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel will leave Ferrari at the end of the season              Suspicions were initially aroused about Abt’s driving after the 27-year-old German qualified in second place and finished third in the actual race having not scored a point in the first four rounds of the series.     Good bye Twitch, good bye streams...Im out. See you never             “Really not happy here because that was not Daniel driving the car himself, and he messed up everything. That was ridiculous,” said former F1 driver Stoffel Vandoornen on his Twitch stream. “I’m questioning if it was really Daniel in the car.”                  “Please ask Daniel Abt to put his Zoom on next time he’s driving, because like Stoffel said, I’m pretty sure he wasn’t in,” two-time FE champion Jean-Eric Vergne said.                  Following an investigation by Formula E on Sunday, which included IP address verification, it was concluded that Abt could not have been behind the wheel.                  The gamer who replaced Abt is widely reported to be 18-year-old Lorenz Hoerzing, who competes in the FE Challenge series, a parallel championship for esport drivers. CNN has reached out to Hoerzing via his Allied esports team for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.                  Abt released an apology shortly afterwards in which he accepted his disqualification                  “I would like to apologize to Formula E, all of the fans, my team and my fellow drivers for having called in outside help during the race on Saturday,” said Abt, who has promised to provide a further update on the story later on Tuesday.

She’s a pro soccer player and a pro esports athlete: Meet RB Leipzig’s Lena Güldenpfennig,"She’s a pro soccer player and a pro esports athlete: Meet RB Leipzig’s Lena Güldenpfennig                    There is a young German forward, playing in the Bundesliga, who scores hundreds of goals every week.                  Before Bayern Munich begins preparing the paperwork for a bid, there is a small disclaimer – many of these goals are scored in the virtual arena of EA Sports’ FIFA video game series.                  But such a caveat doesn’t make the daily balancing act of 20-year-old Lena Güldenpfennig, a striker for RB Leipzig by day and professional player for the club’s esports team RBLZ Gaming by night, any less impressive.                   It’s a multitasking marvel made all the more remarkable by the fact that Güldenpfennig spends the first six hours of the day in school as part of her training to become a kindergarten teacher.                  “This is just my daily routine,” Güldenpfennig explains.                  “I have it every day and I enjoy it very much. I like doing all of this, which is why it works. If it’s fun, then you enjoy doing it, without stress.”                  Having joined RB Leipzig’s footballing academy as a youngster, Güldenpfennig’s excellence on the virtual pitch was cultivated during her years at boarding school.                   As is the case for many, her passion for gaming was forged by the desire to beat her friends – perhaps it was inevitable that, given her other life as a pro footballer, she was destined to take her competitiveness to the highest level.      READ: Arsenal’s virtual Thierry Henry on the inaugural ePremier League               When European football came to a standstill early last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, many footballers put up their feet and picked up their controllers to scratch their competitive itch, but Güldenpfennig had loftier aims.                   Having had “a little” more time to spend with the game – last year’s edition of FIFA 21 – she entered a German Football Association (DFB) online tournament.                  She ended up winning and her performance did not go unnoticed. The following day, she was contacted by RBLZ Gaming, who offered her a chance to join their team.                  One year on and she is already a history maker. In March, she became the first ever woman to play in the Virtual Bundesliga (VBL) – a league contested by esports sides representing 26 real life clubs across Germany’s top two divisions.                  Playing two doubles matches in the South-East division of the club championship against TSG Hoffenheim and FC Nürnberg, Güldenpfenning fired home the first two goals of her VBL career, including a sweetly struck volley.               The goal itself was as impressive as it was poignant – a goal scored by a woman in professional FIFA esports remains a collectors item in a male-dominated landscape.                   A look at the VBL’s current squad rosters paints a pretty bleak picture as regards gender diversity. Of the 107 listed players across all 26 squads, just two women feature – Lena and Anna Klink of Bayer Leverkusen.                   At the last FIFA eWorld Cup in 2019 – held at the O2 Arena in London with a $500,000 prize pot – all 32 finalists were male. Not that Güldenpfennig is deterred.                   “I want to encourage women that more women have the courage to simply show, ‘Here, I can do this too,’” Güldenpfennig said.                  “I would just advise them they shouldn’t hide and definitely don’t be afraid of the boys and men.                  “I want to continue to show here, I have been the first woman – you can do this too.”                  Alongside a lack of representation, sexist abuse, be it via game chat or social media, has often made online gaming a toxic environment for women.                  “There is the occasional message, which appears in my Instagram inbox,” Güldenpfennig admitted.                  “But I didn’t take these to heart and no woman in esports should take these to heart either”.                  With her real-life football season underway and FIFA’s latest edition in the series – FIFA 22 – released last month, Güldenpfennig is firing on all cylinders. She has just under a month to get accustomed to the new game before the 2021-22 VBL season gets underway on November 10.                  Though while many footballers turn to the virtual replica of their sport to wind down, Güldenpfennig actually finds the video game version more mentally taxing than the real thing.                   “In fact, FIFA is more stressful,” Güldenpfennig said, a revelation that will strike a chord with those who annually sacrifice broken controllers to the notorious frustrations of competitive video games.                  “You don’t think of it, but you have to be really present each second. If you switch off once, then this can lead to serious mistakes.                  “What always annoys me is losing or conceding goals. There, I still switch off a little. Another annoying thing is goal cheering or time wasting – you shouldn’t do that, you don’t have to do that.”                  Fortunately, Güldenpfennig’s unique advantage – being able to call upon a lifetime of professional football insight – puts her in the best possible position to dribble around such frustrations.                  “There’s a lot you can transfer into real-life football,” Güldenpfennig said.                  “In terms of tactics, in terms of pressing situations – you can transfer the overview from FIFA into real-life football and the other way around too, so both are reflected in each other a little bit.”                  FIFA’s flagship mode – Ultimate Team – sees players work to build and compete with their own dream team of footballers past and present. Colloquially referred to as ‘cards’ – as per their trading card style design – in-game footballers can be bought and sold on an open market.                   It’s no secret that pro footballers pay close attention to their in-game avatars. A nine-year-old tweet from Roma striker Tammy Abraham that recently resurfaced – “while your [sic] at home playing [FIFA] 12 I’m working hard to be featuring in FIFA 16” – wonderfully encapsulated this connection.                   Güldenpfennig is no different, though given that only a limited number of real-life women’s players from a select set of national teams are in FIFA 22, she awaits the chance to truly bring her double life full-circle.                   “It would be cool if I had my own card,” she laughs, “I think that’s a little dream that each FIFA player has. I don’t know if others would play me then!”                  Based on Güldenpfennig’s answer to the question of her own statistics, her self-depreciation would likely be misplaced.                   Pace has long reigned supreme in FIFA – Kylian Mbappé, the fastest player in this year’s edition, is currently the most expensive player on Ultimate Team – and Güldenpfennig’s description of her potential avatar puts her in a similar bracket.                  “I would give myself the highest [score] in shooting and in the techniques – so in dribbling and passing,” she said.                  “Defending is not really my thing – I shoot the goals and prepare them. So the worst would really be physical and defending. But the rest – pace and shooting – would be okay.”                  But whether its on the pitch or on the screen, it’s safe to say Güldenpfennig will still be excelling.      © 2024 Cable News Network.

First Time In 27 Years: India Pick Up Unwanted Feat After ODI Loss vs Sri Lanka,"STATS: The most spin-dominated ODI series in history  Sri Lanka achieved a major milestone on August 7 (Wednesday) as the Charith Asalanka-led side beat India 2-0 to register a bilateral ODI series win over the Men in Blue for the first time in 27 years. It's a series that has already gone into the record books — not because of the 'upset' but because just how spin-dominated it turned out to be. This series saw the spinners take a whopping 43 wickets in three matches. It's the most wickets taken by the tweakers in a three-match ODI series in history. This series was so spin-dominated that it shattered the previous record set by Bangladesh and Pakistan back in 2011.Most wickets taken by spinners in a three-match ODI series43 wickets - Sri Lanka vs India, 202436 wickets - Bangladesh vs Pakistan, 201133 wickets - Sri Lanka vs South Africa, 202131 wickets - Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe, 199830 wickets - Bangladesh vs England, 2023India themselves ended up setting a personal unwanted record.

"India Finish Fourth Again, Miss Out On Olympics Shooting Mixed Team Skeet Bronze Medal","India Finish Fourth Again, Miss Out On Olympics Shooting Mixed Team Skeet Bronze Medal                              The Indian shooting duo of Maheshwari Chauhan and Anantjeet Singh Naruka fought tooth and nail before missing out on a bronze medal by a whisker in the skeet mixed team event, finishing fourth at the Paris Olympics here on Monday. Maheshwari and Naruka shot 43 to finish fourth behind China's Yiting Jiang and Jianlin Lyu (44) in a thrilling match for the bronze medal. Earlier, the Indians finished fourth in the qualification after both teams were tied on 146 at the end of the three-round, 150-shot process, forcing a shoot-off.In the qualification, Maheshwari shone with 50/50 in her final two rounds while Naruka notched scores of 25, 23 and 24 in the three rounds.What swung the match in China's favour was the incredible form of Lyu who did not miss a single shot on way to the podium, even as his partner Jiang recovered after a rare three straight misses to help the pair to victory.At the start of the medal round, China's Lyu and Jiang earned perfect scores of 4/4 against India.In reply, India's Naruka missed out on one of the four targets (3/4) in the first station. Chauhan shot a score of 4/4 to get off to a good start.Trailing China (8/8) after the first station, India (7/8) fought back in station two and restored parity heading into the third station. What helped the Indians at this stage was the three successive misses by Jiang.Even as Lyu continued with his flawless shooting, Jiang missed one but then got his act together to finish on a strong note.In order to win a bronze, India were left with the task to hit all eight targets while hoping that China would miss a few.Naruka and Chauhan fired all four targets in the decider, but Lyu and Jiang kept their nerves and succeeded in all their attempts to edge out the Indians by just one point.Earlier, the Indian pair was placed tied second with a score of 49 after the first stage in the qualification, sharing the position with Australia, Korea, France and two Italian teams.Naruka scored 25/25 in the first round the qualification while Maheshwari shot 24/25 to take India's total to 49.AdvertisementIn the second round, it was Maheshwari's turn to shoot a perfect 25 but Naruka missed two shots each in the 2nd and 5th series to tally 23, which gave them an aggregate score of 48.In the third round, India got 49 with 25 for Maheshwari and 24 for Naruka.China finished a place above India after prevailing in the shoot-off to decide the third and fourth place. Both were tied on a score of 146.Italy's Gabriele Rossetti and Diana Bacosi shot 149/150 to equal the world record in qualification. They were joined by American Vincent Hancock and Austen Jewell Smith (148) in the gold medal match.The result notwithstanding, India will return from the games with the biggest-ever haul of three medals -- all bronze through Manu Bhaker, Swapnil Kusale and Sarabjot Singh.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

"Former England cricketer Graham Thorpe passes away, aged 55","Feedback   Friday, August 16, 2024 					12/08/24   5:08 pm			 										Former England cricketer and coach Graham Thorpe took his own life, his wife and children revealed on Monday. They said that he made this decision after suffering from severe depression and anxiety over the past two years.Thorpe died at the age of 55, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed on 6 August, but the former Surrey batter had been ill since May 2022. His wife Amanda disclosed that Graham made a serious attempt on his life two years ago and did not get better.“For the past couple of years, Graham had been suffering from major depression and anxiety. Despite glimpses of hope of the old Graham, he continued to suffer from depression and anxiety, which at times got very severe. We supported him as a family and he tried many, many treatments but unfortunately none of them really seemed to work.”, Amanda told his former teammate Michael Atherton in the Times.Thorpe played exactly 100 Tests for England and scored 16 centuries before retiring in 2005, having scored 6,744 runs at an average of 44.66 and went on to become England’s batting coach, a position he held until 2022.05/06/24   9:19 am03/11/23   2:08 pm23/11/23   2:57 pm05/06/24   8:38 am29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pmWe will send you breaking news right to your inbox",True,True,False
"Gautam Gambhir will not be able last long as India head coach given that he has a particular way of doing things which may not sit well with everyone, says Gambhir's former teammate Joginder Sharma.","‘Gautam Gambhir won’t last…’: Former World Cup hero makes bold prediction about India head coach’s future  Gautam Gambhir was appointed India head coach last month following the end of Rahul Dravid's tenure. The former India cricketer has been given a long tenure in the role, which runs until the end of the ODI World Cup in 2027. However, Gambhir's former teammate Joginder Sharma has predicted that Gambhir may not complete his full term as India coach and could be heading for an early exit.  Speaking on the Shubhankar Mishra podcast, Sharma said, ""Gautam Gambhir team ko sambhalne waala hai lekin par mera ye manna hai ki Gautam Gambhir jyada lambe samay tak tik nahi payega (Gautam Gambhir is the one to manage the team, but I believe that Gautam Gambhir will not be able to stay for a long time),"" Joginder said on Shubhankar Mishra's podcast. Sharma also stated that Gambhir could have disagreements with a player because he sometimes makes decisions that are not liked by others. ""Kyunki Gautam Gambhir ke apne hi kuch faisle hote hain. Ho sakta hai kisi player se man motaaw ho jaye. Mai Virat Kohli ki baat nahi kar raha hun. Gautam Gambhir ke faisle kai baar aise ho jaate hain ki dusro ko pasand nahi aate (This is because Gautam Gambhir has his own decisions. It might happen that he has a disagreement with a player. I am not talking about Virat Kohli. Many times, Gautam Gambhir's decisions are such that others do not like them),"" Sharma added Notably, this is the first time Gambhir has donned the coach's hat in an official capacity. Prior to his experience as India head coach, Gambhir was a mentor for Kolkata Knight Riders where he helped the team win their third IPL title. He was also the mentor of Lucknow Super Giants, who qualified for the playoffs two years in a row under his aegis.

"South Africa are looking to give Tristan Stubbs an extended run at No. 3 in their Test batting line-up, starting with this week's first Test against the West Indies in Port of Spain, coach Shukri Conrad said on Tuesday.","Coach Conrad backs big hitting Stubbs at number three in test side  Aug 5 - South Africa are looking to give Tristan Stubbs an extended run at No. 3 in their test batting line-up, starting with this week’s first test against the West Indies in Port of Spain, coach Shukri Conrad said on Tuesday. Stubbs, who turns 24 next week, has forged a reputation for his swashbuckling and powerful batting in the Twenty20 format but is now set for a role of some responsibility in the test side. He has played only one test previously, against India in January where he scored four runs in his two innings and saw South Africa lose by seven wickets. South Africa have struggled to find a consistent No. 3 in their batting line-up in recent years. “Tristan’s going to be given a good run in that position,” Conrad said. “I think his psyche and technique speaks to someone who will do that job really well. And I'm going to give him a good run. I'd be surprised if we didn't back him throughout the rest of the cycle,” he told a virtual press conference. “I'm very confident that he’s going to come good, whether it's in the first test match, or the second, but I think we've got a good one for the future in the South African set up.” Conrad said Stubbs’ technique was the major factor in giving him the job, but also his imposing size. “Because you're going to be facing the new ball the bulk of the time, I know Tristan ticks all of those boxes. He's also quite an imposing character, a big strong boy, strapping boy. And I quite like that. I like the fact that at the top of the order we will imposing guys who have got a good aura about them with strong body language. “But ultimately, the proof is going be in the tasting. But yeah, I'm going down this road, and I'm confident we begin to reap the rewards.” South Africa play a first test series since sending a second-string side to New Zealand in February and suffering two heavy defeats. They take on a Windies team who last month lost a three-test series in England. “They've got three tough test matches under the belt and they'll come into this series at home taking a lot of confidence from several good performances,” Conrad said of the opposition.

As the most dominant player on one of football’s most dominant offensive lines, Allen was a key addition to the dynastic 1990s Cowboys teams that were studded with Hall of Famers like Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin, Deion Sanders and Emmitt Smith, who routinely blew through holes created by Allen on his way to becoming the league’s all-time rushing leader. Drafted as a guard, Allen played every position on the offensive line except center. A seven-time All-Pro, he was a first-ballot inductee into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013 and was named to the league’s all-decade teams for both the 1990s and the 2000s. ADVERTISEMENT Working in the trenches, Allen did not stand out to casual fans in the same way his touchdown-scoring All-Pro teammates did. But those teammates keenly understood his value. “I always hear people say Larry was the best offensive lineman in the game, and that’s just not right,” Irvin once said. “Larry was the best player in the league, and it wasn’t even close.” Allen, who stood 6-foot-3 and weighed about 325 pounds, was a Goliath among Goliaths, known as the strongest player in the league. In 2001, he left jaws agape after bench-pressing 700 pounds in the Cowboys’ weight room. How The Times decides who gets an obituary.

If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here. He blew away the field in the “strongest man” competition at the 2006 Pro Bowl. Allen breezed through 43 reps on a 225-pound bench press, prompting ESPN’s Chris Berman to observe, “Those first 30, he looked like he was lifting a salad fork.” But Allen was more than just a mountain of a man. Blessed with impressive quickness and speed for his size, he was a total athlete. He astonished coaches at Sonoma State University who were recruiting him by showing that, at 320 pounds, he could dunk a basketball. ADVERTISEMENT “You could have heard a pin drop when he slammed the ball,” Tim Scalercio, a Sonoma State coach, said in a 2013 interview. “It was like in the movies where it just goes ‘tick, tick, tick, tick’ and stops.” Even the best defensive linemen who went up against Allen often ended up on the wrong end of a pancake block. John Randle, a star defensive tackle for the Minnesota Vikings who was known for his trash talking, tended to clam up when he faced Allen. “That man could launch you,” Randle said in a 2010 N.F.L. video honoring Allen as one its top 100 greatest players. “It was like going up against a bear.” Allen himself went about his business quietly. “During my career, I didn’t talk that much,” he said in his Hall of Fame induction speech. “I didn’t have to, I used my helmet.” Larry Christopher Allen Jr. was born in Los Angeles on Nov. 27, 1971, to Larry and Vera Allen. Growing up in Compton, Calif., he started playing football as a way to stay out of trouble on the streets. Still, trouble occasionally found him. When he was about 10, he was stabbed 12 times while trying to protect his younger brother in a fight. ADVERTISEMENT After his father left the family, his mother sought to keep him from the temptations of gang life, moving from Compton to Northern California and enrolling him in a series of high schools, including, ultimately, Vintage High School in Napa, although he did not graduate. Without the academic credentials to play football for a Division 1 college program, he spent two years starring at Butte College, a community college in Oroville, Calif., before landing at Sonoma State, about 50 miles north of San Francisco. Although the university was anything but a football factory, Allen was twice an All-American there, allowing only one sack in two seasons. The Cowboys chose him in the second round of the 1994 N.F.L. draft, and he took little time to make his mark. During a “Monday Night Football” game against the New Orleans Saints in his rookie year, a rumbling Allen astonished viewers by chasing down the fleet-footed linebacker Darion Conner, who had a seemingly clear path to the end zone after an interception. “That’s one of the most impressive athletic feats I have ever seen,” the announcer Dan Dierdorf said. Allen’s survivors include his wife, Janelle (Trimboli) Allen; two daughters, Jayla and Loriana Allen; and a son, Larry III, a former guard for Harvard. ADVERTISEMENT After his storied run with the Cowboys, Allen played two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, where he earned his final Pro Bowl nod before retiring in 2008. As John Madden, the Hall of Fame coach and broadcaster, once said of Allen, “If somebody said to God, ‘What should all the guards look like?,’ then he would send Larry Allen down.” Alex Williams is a Times reporter on the Obituaries desk.

"Parnelli Jones, Champion Auto Racer and Record Setter, Is Dead at 90","Parnelli Jones, Champion Auto Racer and Record Setter, Is Dead at 90  ADVERTISEMENT  He was one of the greatest drivers of the 1960s and ’70s, winning six Indy races and four major NASCAR events while setting speed marks. By Richard Goldstein Parnelli Jones, who as a teenager traded in a horse for a hot rod and went on to become one of the biggest stars in auto racing and a storied figure at the Indianapolis 500, died on Tuesday in Torrance, Calif., where he had lived for many years. He was 90. His son P.J. confirmed in an interview that Jones died at Torrance Memorial Medical Center surrounded by family and friends. He had been treated for Parkinson’s disease since it was diagnosed about 10 years ago, his son said. Jones was best known for his exploits at the Indy 500 in the 1960s, when it was still the premier event in auto racing. He was the oldest surviving winner of the race. “Parnelli Jones was the greatest driver of his era,” his contemporary Mario Andretti once said. “He had aggressiveness and also a finesse that no one else possessed. And he won on everything he put his hands on.” ADVERTISEMENT Jones captured dozens of races, winning six times in Indy races and four times in NASCAR events and triumphing in off-road, sports car, sprint and midget races as well. Jones was once asked if there had ever been anyone better than him. “I don’t think so,” he told Car and Driver magazine in 2013. “You can teach somebody how to drive, but you can’t teach them that will and desire and kick-butt attitude.” How The Times decides who gets an obituary. There is no formula, scoring system or checklist in determining the news value of a life. We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here. Rufus Parnell Jones was born on Aug. 12, 1933, in Texarkana, Ark., the oldest of three children, and grew up in Torrance, south of Los Angeles, where his father, Commodore Jones, was a shipyard worker. After selling a horse he owned at age 16 and using the proceeds to buy a hot rod, Jones became fascinated by jalopy racing. He would bounce his cars off trees just for the thrill of it. “I had all this desire and no talent, and I was wrecking my car every week,” he told Investor’s Business Daily in 2013. ADVERTISEMENT At 17, he began racing jalopies at a speedway in Gardena, Calif. He passed himself off as 21, the minimum age required to drive there, by getting a fake identification card that dropped Rufus as his first name in favor of Parnellie Jones, which was painted on his racecar (spelling it then with a second “e”). “When I was a kid, there was a freckle-faced girl at school named Nellie who my friend, Billy Calder, teased me about,” Jones told Southbay Magazine, a Los Angeles County publication, in 2013. “He would yell, ‘Nellie loves Parnelli! Nellie loves Parnelli!’ That was the name that I thought of when I got the fake I.D.” Jones toured the Midwest fair circuit in the late 1950s, driving midget and sprint cars, and came to the attention of the racecar owner J.C. Agajanian, who sponsored him for Indy races. He might have won all seven of the ones he raced in if not for bad luck in his first. He was among the leaders in his first Indy 500, in 1961, but faded to 12th place after debris from a wreck cut his eyebrow and bloodied his goggles. He shared rookie of the year honors with Bobby Marshman. ADVERTISEMENT Jones won the pole for the 1962 race when he set a record average qualifying time of 150.370 miles an hour. He was leading more than halfway through the event, but a brake problem left him in seventh place. “I can remember after the ’61 rookie year and how I had a chance to win, that I couldn’t wait until next year,” he once said. “Then, after ’62, when I was leading and long gone, I couldn’t wait till the next year. I just felt like it owed me.” His victory in the 1963 race came while driving an Offenhauser-powered Watson roadster that he called Ol’ Calhoun, the nickname coming from an obscure football joke. But the win was not without controversy. Jones’s car began leaking oil while he led in the late stages. The race’s chief steward considered ordering him off the track, but the leak eventually stopped and he continued on, besting Jimmy Clark of Scotland — who driving a Lotus Ford, one of the few rear-engine cars in the race — by nearly 34 seconds. Jones averaged 143.137 miles an hour, an Indy 500 record at the time. ADVERTISEMENT The following day, the driver Eddie Sachs, who claimed that oil from Jones’s car had caused him to slide into a wall, got into an argument with him. As Jones told MotorSport magazine in 2013: “I said, ‘I oughtta bust you in the mouth.’ And he said, ‘Go ahead.’ So I let him have it.” Jones’s final Indy 500 came in 1967, when he drove Andy Granatelli’s revolutionary turbine-powered car, which was considerably faster than the traditional piston-engine cars. He was leading A.J. Foyt by more than a mile with seven and a half miles to go when a bearing, reportedly costing $6, failed in his gear box, forcing him to limp into the pits as Foyt went on to his third Indy 500 triumph. In 1971 and ’72, Jones won the off-road race that came to be known as the Baja 1000, and he captured the Sports Car Club of America’s 1970 road-racing Trans-Am Championship. He was a team owner with his business partner Vel Miletich, sponsoring Al Unser Sr. in Unser’s 1970 and ’71 Indy 500 victories. Jones’s team competed in Formula 1 from 1974 to 1976, but his best finish in that venue was fourth in the 1975 Sweden Grand Prix. In addition to his son P.J., he is survived by his wife, Judy Jones; another son, Page; and six grandchildren. ADVERTISEMENT After his racing years, Jones operated chains of tire dealerships and auto parts distributorships. At times, he showed a penchant for speed away from the pro circuit. He told how in the aftermath of his 1963 Indy 500 victory, a police officer stopped him for speeding on a Southern California freeway and asked him, “Who do you think you are, Parnelli Jones?” His 2012 autobiography, written with Bones Bourcier, a journalist, was titled, “As a Matter of Fact, I Am Parnelli Jones.” Alexandra Petri contributed reporting.

Muhammad Ali’s Childhood Home Goes on the Market,"Muhammad Ali’s Childhood Home Goes on the Market  ADVERTISEMENT  The boxing champion lived in the one-story house in Louisville, Ky., which in recent years became a museum. It’s listed for sale, along with two neighboring properties, for $1.5 million. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Johnny Diaz The childhood home where Muhammad Ali, the three-time world heavyweight boxing champion and activist, learned to box and that was along the route of his funeral procession in Louisville, Ky., is for sale. On Tuesday, the pink one-story home, which for several years was a museum of sorts, focusing on Ali’s early life and humanitarian pursuits, and two of its neighboring properties were listed for sale through Christie’s International Real Estate Bluegrass for $1.5 million, according to the company’s listing. “Home to ‘The Greatest,’” the listing states, noting that the ranch style, one-story house at 3302 Grand Avenue in the Parkland neighborhood of the city features two bedrooms. The living area of the three homes combined is 3,363 square feet. Rusty Underwood, one of the listing agents, described the property as “a rare offering.’’ “Muhammad Ali spent the better part of his childhood and adulthood on the property,” he said on Tuesday. George Bochetto, a trial lawyer in Philadelphia who said he owns the house with his late partner’s widow, bought it in 2016 for $60,000. “It was abandoned for many years. It was run down,’’ Mr. Bochetto said in an interview on Tuesday. He marveled at how “this small home in the west end of Louisville, as modest as a home it was, could produce a magnificent worldwide figure.’” He added, “Muhammad Ali was a boyhood hero of mine.” Mr. Bochetto said he wants the new owners “to make sure the house is preserved” as an honor to him. The sale would also include the contents inside the house, he said. “It’s now my goal to sell this property to either an institution or an individual or group of individuals that will be dedicated to preserving and promoting the property as a national historic site and monument,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Built in 1920, the home has had different owners over the years. The Ali family sold it to Jared Weiss in 2012, who then formed a partnership with Mr. Bochetto, according to The Courier Journal of Louisville, which reported on the listing. He also made the property into a museum, which opened for tours days before the 2016 death of Ali, who had Parkinson’s disease for more than 30 years and who died at 74. Mr. Bochetto said the museum shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The exterior of the residence features a plaque honoring Ali, who was born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on Jan. 17, 1942, and lived there with his parents and brother. It also notes that Ali attended local public schools, which mostly enrolled Black students. Mr. Bochetto said that about $1 million was spent to rehab the house to replicate it to look the way it did when Ali and his family lived there for 20 years. That included the home’s furnishings, appliances and artwork, according to Mr. Bochetto. ADVERTISEMENT Ali fans looking to learn more about his life and social activism can visit the nearby Muhammad Ali Center, also in Louisville, “which provides education and community engagement to continue Ali’s legacy and inspire greatness.” A spokeswoman for that museum, which receives about 100,000 visitors annually, said the center is not affiliated with Ali's childhood home that is for sale. Mr. Bochetto said he would be selective when it comes to choosing a buyer. “I am certainly not going to entertain a sale for someone who wants to knock it down and build a house,’’ Mr. Bochetto said of potential new owners. “Now if they want to continue it as a museum, it’s all set up to do that,” he added. “It doesn’t necessarily have to remain a museum, although that would be nice. It would have to stay as a preserved historic monument.” Johnny Diaz is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news from Miami. More about Johnny Diaz ADVERTISEMENT",True,True,True
"Rob Burrow, Rugby Star and A.L.S. Campaigner, Dies at 41","Rugby star and ALS campaigner Rob Burrow dies at age 41   Rob Burrow ahead of the ‘2023 Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon’ which started and finished at Headingley Stadium, Leeds, May, 14, 2023. Rob Burrow, a former rugby star who was widely praised for his fundraising campaigns after being diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease in 2019, has died. He was 41. (Danny Lawson/PA via AP)     LEEDS, England (AP) — Rob Burrow, a former rugby star who was widely praised for his fundraising and awareness campaigns after being diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease in 2019, has died. He was 41. Leeds Rhinos announced his death on Sunday. Burrow spent his entire career at the English rugby league club and helped them win eight Super League titles. He retired in 2017 and two years later it was revealed Burrow had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neurone disease (MND). He went on to raise funds to help build a new care center for ALS patients alongside former teammate Kevin Sinfield. “It is with deep sadness that the club can confirm that former player Rob Burrow CBE has passed away, aged 41,” Leeds said in a statement. “Rob inspired the entire country with his brave battle against Motor Neurone Disease (MND) since his diagnosis in December 2019. He passed away peacefully at Pinderfield’s Hospital (in Wakefield) near his home surrounded by his loving family after becoming ill earlier this week.” In a personally signed message Sunday on X, Britain’s Prince William said: “He taught us, ‘in a world full of adversity, we must dare to dream.’ Catherine and I send our love to Lindsey, Jackson, Maya and Macy.” Born in Pontefract, Burrow progressed through Leeds’ academy to debut in 2001 and establish himself as a great of the sport. Silverware would follow with a first Super League title achieved in 2004 alongside national-team honors with England for the first time.  Great Britain would turn to Burrow for its test series with New Zealand in 2007 and he starred in the 3-0 victory where he was awarded player of the series following two tries and nine goals. Burrow was a key figure for Leeds during a trophy-laden spell where they claimed World Club Challenge glory in 2005, 2008 and again in 2012 alongside two Challenge Cups. The fearsome scrum-half announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2017 season in July of that year and enjoyed a fairy-tale finish after Leeds beat Castleford 24-6 in the Grand Final at Old Trafford. Coaching was the next focus for Burrow after he started to work in the Leeds academy before the ALS diagnosis followed. He went on to feature in an award-winning BBC documentary, “Rob Burrow — My Year with MND,” which provided a look behind the curtain of his illness and the impact on his wife Lindsey alongside his three children. Sinfield picked up the fundraising baton from Burrow as his condition worsened, including running seven marathons in seven days. “Along with his friend and former teammate Kevin Sinfield, Burrow has inspired nearly 20 million pounds ($25.5 million) in fundraising across the UK and Ireland,” the Leeds statement said. “This has included raising over 6 million pounds to build the Rob Burrow Centre for MND in Leeds.” In May 2023, Sinfield carried Burrow over the finish line at the inaugural Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon after pushing his great friend for the distance. “Today was the day that I hoped would never come,” Sinfield wrote on social media. “The world has lost a great man and a wonderful friend to so many.” AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

"Bill Walton, N.B.A. Hall of Famer and Broadcasting Star, Dies at 71","Bill Walton, N.B.A. Hall of Famer and Broadcasting Star, Dies at 71  ADVERTISEMENT  He won championships in high school, college (U.C.L.A.) and the pros (Trail Blazers and Celtics) before turning to TV as a talkative game analyst in the college ranks. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Richard Sandomir Bill Walton, a center whose extraordinary passing and rebounding skills helped him win two national college championships with U.C.L.A. and one each with the Portland Trail Blazers and Boston Celtics of the N.B.A., and who overcame a stutter to become a loquacious commentator, died on Monday at his home in San Diego. He was 71. The N.B.A. said he died of colon cancer. A redheaded hippie and devoted Grateful Dead fan, Walton was an acolyte of the U.C.L.A. coach John Wooden and the hub of the Bruins team that won N.C.A.A. championships in 1972 and 1973 and extended an 88-game winning streak that had begun in 1971. He was named the national player of the year three times. Walton’s greatest game was the 1973 national championship against Memphis State, played in St. Louis. He got into foul trouble in the first half, but went on to score a record 44 points on 21-for-22 shooting and had 11 rebounds in U.C.L.A.’s 87-66 victory. It was the school’s ninth title in 10 years. Walton — not yet known for his often hyperbolic, stream of consciousness speaking skills — refused to say much after the game. As he left the locker room, he told reporters, “Excuse me, I want to go meet my friends. I’m splitting.” ADVERTISEMENT He played one more year at U.C.L.A. before being selected by Portland first overall in the 1974 N.B.A. draft. He weathered injuries, two losing seasons under Coach Lenny Wilkens and criticism over his vegetarian diet and his red ponytail and beard before winning the 1977 championship under Coach Jack Ramsay. “I think Jack Ramsay reached Walton,” Eddie Donovan, the Knicks general manager, told the columnist Dave Anderson of The New York Times. “Of all the coaches in our league, Jack Ramsay is the closest to being the John Wooden type — scholarly, available. I think Walton responded to that.” But the question that lingered throughout Walton’s N.B.A. career was how good he would have been if not for his many injuries. Better than Bill Russell? Wilt Chamberlain? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, one of his predecessors at U.C.L.A.? Walton never played in more than 65 games in a season during his years in Portland — even in the 1977-78 season, when he was named most valuable player, he appeared in just 58 games — and he missed four full seasons (1978-79, 1980-81, 1981-82 and 1987-88). ADVERTISEMENT “When I’m healthy,” he said early in his Portland career, “I play real good, I think.” He was asked whether anyone had seen the real Bill Walton. How The Times decides who gets an obituary. There is no formula, scoring system or checklist in determining the news value of a life. We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here. “I don’t think so,” he said. He had a knee injury as a teenager during a playground game. But, as he wrote in one of his memoirs, “Back From the Dead: Searching for the Sound, Shining the Light and Throwing It Down” (2016), it was “my malformed feet — my faulty foundation, which led to the endless string of stress fractures which ultimately brought on the whole mess I’m in now.” He underwent about 40 orthopedic surgeries, mostly on his feet and ankles. “My feet were not built to last — or to play basketball,” he added. “My skeletal, structural foundation — inflexible and rigid — could not absorb the endless stress and impact of running, jumping, turning, twisting and pounding for 26 years.” William Theodore Walton III was born on Nov. 5, 1952, in La Mesa, Calif., near downtown San Diego. His father, called Ted, was a social worker and adult educator, and his mother, Gloria (Hickey) Walton, was a librarian. Bill was extremely shy because of his stutter and wrote that in school he almost never spoke in class and was glad when teachers did not call on him. He recalled in his memoir that his “basketball fever spiked” after the family next door dismantled its backboard and basket and he and his father reassembled it at their home. ADVERTISEMENT “I was in heaven,” he wrote. “I could play whenever I wanted, and I did.” It was the start of a long love affair with basketball that led to two state championships for his Helix High School team, in La Mesa. The squad won 49 consecutive games at one point. He moved on to U.C.L.A., recruited when it was the dominant team in college basketball. With Walton, the Bruins had two 30-0 seasons and finished 86-4 in his three varsity campaigns. While at U.C.L.A., Walton was arrested during a protest against the Vietnam War. He was also politically aware of his status as a white player with mostly Black teammates. “The Blacks have gotten a raw deal for a long time,” he told the sportswriter Bill Libby after his arrest, according to The Nation. “A lot of my teammates are Black, and I really admire the way they’ve risen above their raw deal. They’re my friends, and I feel for them. I know I’ve gotten twice as much as I deserve because I’m white.” Walton was friendly with the leftist radicals Jack and Micki Scott and appeared with them at a news conference in San Francisco in 1975. The Scotts had been in hiding and resurfaced amid accusations that they had sheltered Patricia Hearst (Scott later admitted that he had) after she had been kidnapped by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. ADVERTISEMENT Walton had briefly shared a home in Portland with the Scotts and had been questioned about them by the F.B.I. Speaking to the Scotts at the news conference, Walton said, “I am sorry for any inconvenience I may have caused you, and you can rest assured that I will never talk to the enemy again.” With his injuries derailing his career, Walton left the Blazers to sign with the San Diego (now Los Angeles) Clippers in 1979, but, again, injuries prevented him from playing in many of their games over four seasons. In 1985, the Clippers traded him to the Boston Celtics, where he found joy as a reserve player, winning the Sixth Man of the Year Award, as the Celtics won the 1986 N.B.A. title, defeating the Houston Rockets. “The Celtics’ jigsaw had been missing a giant piece — a center to spell Robert Parish — and Walton nestled snugly into place,” Sports Illustrated wrote in 1986, referring to the team’s starting center. ADVERTISEMENT But foot injuries limited Walton to 10 games the next season, the last he would play. Over 10 seasons, he averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds a game. He was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. Last year, ESPN’s “30 for 30” documentary series told Walton’s life in four parts. Despite his injury-limited career, the series was titled “The Luckiest Guy in the World.” His first marriage, to Susan Guth, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Lori (Matsuoka) Walton; his sons from his first marriage, Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke, who is a former coach of the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings; his sister, Cathy Walton; his brother Andy; and nine grandchildren. His brother Bruce died in 2019. In the 1990s, Walton moved to an improbable new career: television game analyst. “English is my fourth language,” he told Sports Illustrated in 2000, “after Stumbling, Stammering and Bumbling.” He dealt with his stutter using techniques that he learned from the sportscaster Marty Glickman, and went on to call N.B.A. and college games for several networks, including NBC, ESPN, CBS and the Pac-12 Network. His play-by-play partners included Marv Albert, Tom Hammond and Dave Pasch. Walton brought an idiosyncratic style to his commentary, which combined his over-the-top enthusiasm for basketball with weird flights of fancy and musical and science references. He was so garrulous and windy that if given the airspace, he could speak for an entire game without letting his partner speak. ADVERTISEMENT His catchphrase, “Throw it down, big man,” which he shouted at centers and forwards, inspired “Throw It Down,” an alternate game broadcast that featured him and his co-host, Jason Benetti, in which Walton offered analysis and told stories. It started appearing on NBA League Pass in the 2022-23 season. His opinions could sometimes be covered in unconventional verbal clothing. “Come on, that was no foul!” he once declared. “It may be a violation of all the rules of human decency, but it’s not a foul.” Another time he exclaimed: “A thing of beauty! Einstein, da Vinci, Jobs! And now Tyreke Evans!” An earlier version of this obituary misstated the impact that repeated injuries had on Walton’s playing time as a professional. He never played in more than 65 games in a season during his years with the Portland Trail Blazers as a result of injuries. It was not the case that he never played in more than 70 games as a professional. (He played in 80 games for the Boston Celtics during the 1985-86 season.)

"50 Years Ago, Chris Evert and Bjorn Borg Changed Tennis","ADVERTISEMENT  As teenagers, they brought the two-handed backhand to the sport — and to their first major championships, both at the French Open. By Cindy Shmerler When Chris Evert arrived in Paris for the 1973 French Open, she was an 18-year-old making just her second trip out of the United States. So she is still baffled as to why Philippe Chatrier, then the president of the French Tennis Federation, decided to take her and her mother, Colette, to Le Lido, the legendary burlesque theater on the Champs-Élysées. “He took us to dinner, and it was a dance club with half-naked women,” Evert said by phone from her Florida home in April. “They had their breasts showing. My eyes were like saucers. I had never been exposed to anything so sophisticated like that.” For Bjorn Borg, the ultimate Paris experience was celebrating his first French Open championship in 1974 with a private dinner in the Eiffel Tower. It has been more than a half century since Borg and Evert first played the French Open, but this year marks the 50th anniversary of their winning their first major championships in Paris. Evert went on to capture 18 Grand Slam singles titles, including a record seven at the French Open, six at the United States Open, three at Wimbledon and two at the Australian Open. Borg won six French Opens from 1974 to 1981 and five consecutive Wimbledons from 1976 to 1980. Borg was just days shy of his 17th birthday when he lost to Adriano Panatta in the round of 16 at the French Open in 1973, only his second appearance at a major after a first-round loss at the 1972 U.S. Open. “When I started to play tennis at 8, 9 years old, I had three dreams,” Borg, who will turn 68 in June, said from his home outside Stockholm. “One was to play Davis Cup for Sweden, one was to walk on Centre Court at Wimbledon and the third dream was to win a Grand Slam tournament. Those were my dreams when I was hitting the ball against the wall. So, it meant a lot for me to come to Paris and play my first match in that beautiful stadium.” After reaching the semifinals of the U.S. Open in 1971 and the semis of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 1972, Evert made her first appearance at the French Open the next year. She reached the final, where she led Margaret Court, the No. 1 seed, by a set and was up 5-3, just two points from the championship in the second set, before losing 6-7 (5), 7-6 (6), 6-4. ADVERTISEMENT “I just didn’t have that intense feeling,” said Evert, who will turn 70 in December. “Everyone thinks I had that killer instinct like I did in the juniors with the girls my own age. But when I got to the women’s tournament, for some reason I was just more relaxed, and I felt like I had time on my side. I didn’t have the fervor to win that match.” A year later, Borg and Evert were ready. Borg remembers being down 4-1 and two breaks of serve in the deciding set of his first-round match against Jean-François Caujolle. He then needed five sets to beat Erik Van Dillen and Raul Ramirez before facing Manuel Orantes in the final. After dropping the first two sets, Borg rallied for a 2-6, 6-7 (4), 6-0, 6-1, 6-1 win. “Before the tournament I would definitely say I was not the favorite to win,” Borg said. “I surprised myself by being in my first Grand Slam final. I was a bit nervous, but I think he felt more pressure than I did. Plus, he got very tired. And the more we played, the more tired he got and the more pressure I could see that he felt.” ADVERTISEMENT Evert has no recollection of whom she played along the way to capturing her first French Open in 1974. She doesn’t recall ousting Virginia Ruzici, who would go on to win the 1978 French Open and then lose to Evert in the final in 1980. Or that she didn’t lose a set en route to the title, which she won 6-1, 6-2 over her friend and doubles partner Olga Morozova. She does, however, remember having a vastly different attitude that year. “I was a different person,” Evert said. “I had the experience of the year before, of letting it slip away, of not closing it out like I should have, and I learned from that. I was mentally tougher, and I knew that if I had that opportunity again, to close out the match and win a Slam, I was going to do it.” Evert won again in 1975 and, after skipping the tournament for three years to play World Team Tennis, she won back-to-back championships again in 1979 and 1980. Her greatest victory came in 1985, when she upset top-seeded Martina Navratilova 6-3, 6-7 (4), 7-5 in a nearly three-hour final that enabled her to reclaim the world No. 1 ranking. She beat Navratilova again in the 1986 final for her last victory at a major. Evert and Borg possessed tangible similarities. Both were introverts by nature and, for the most part, imperturbable on the court. They, along with Jimmy Connors, hit with then-novel two-handed backhands, spawning generations of players with double-fisted ground strokes. And they both almost never missed. “I think we introduced the world to the way we played,” Borg said. “Chrissie and I liked to play from the back court. We had two-handed backhands, and not too many players did that.” ADVERTISEMENT To Evert, whose two-handed backhand was encouraged by her teaching-pro father, Jimmy, Borg was always the star. “In Paris they were a little behind the times when it came to equality and women’s liberation and celebrating women athletes,” said Evert, who won at least one major every year from 1974 to 1986. “It was all about men’s tennis. And Bjorn was like a rock star, like one of the Beatles. He had to have security guards around him. The girls were screaming and crying and trying to grab at him. I’d never seen anybody idolized like him. To this day I think he’s still the biggest star tennis has ever had.” Even the current generation of players recognizes the impact that Borg and Evert have had. “Bjorn Borg? I mean he was a freak,” said Frances Tiafoe. “He was unreal. Crazy records within a short span. He didn’t say a word, the silent assassin. His movement, great form, he changed the game to be played more from the back of the court. He was a full-on rock star, the kind of guy I like.” Jessica Pegula called Evert a legend. “She changed the game with her two-handed backhand, not just for girls but for guys too,” Pegula said. “She was a trendsetter, which is pretty cool.” ADVERTISEMENT Evert said she believed that her legacy in the sport was more than her backhand and steely determination. “My real legacy was bringing girls into the game of tennis,” she said. “Bjorn and I were the first teenagers who made it big. And we brought a new generation of kids to the game.” As for the 50th anniversary of their first French Open titles, Borg and Evert are struck by the speed of time. “It sounds scary when you say it, really strange,” said Borg, who will retire as captain of the Laver Cup’s Team Europe after this year’s event in Berlin in September. “Fifty years is a long time, but I remember it like it was yesterday, and it’s good to have that memory.” “When I hear it, I can’t believe it,” said Evert, who recently concluded chemotherapy for a recurrence of ovarian cancer and will return to ESPN’s broadcast booth at the French Open and at Wimbledon. “I’m in the last trimester of my life right now, and yeah, it makes me feel old.” An earlier version of a picture caption with this article, relying on incorrect information from The Associated Press, misstated the given name of the mother of Jimmy Connors.

"Hsieh Su-Wei, at 38, Is a Dominant Force in Doubles","Hsieh Su-Wei, at 38, Is a Dominant Force in Doubles  ADVERTISEMENT  She has won seven majors, including the French Open twice. By Cindy Shmerler When Hsieh Su-Wei walked on the court to play doubles at the Miami Open in March with her partner, Elise Mertens, she wasn’t burdened by a cumbersome tennis bag holding half a dozen rackets, an assortment of snacks and multiple changes of clothes and shoes. Despite being  No. 1 in the world in doubles, Hsieh, 38, wore an outfit that she bought off the rack and that bore none of the logos associated with lucrative sponsorship deals that many of her colleagues on the WTA Tour have. Until recently, Hsieh had no manager, requiring her to sell herself to sponsors. Her efforts so far have been unsuccessful. “It’s not an easy job dealing with the sponsorship when the people are not sure if they are going to have you or not,” said Hsieh, who typically competes with just two rackets, which she said was no problem since she had never broken one and could not remember the last time she even popped a string. “I don’t want to waste the time to do it. I just want to focus on my tennis.” ADVERTISEMENT Hsieh has never been consumed by the trappings of her sport, preferring to travel her own circuitous path. An accomplished singles player, she ranked a career high No. 23 in 2013 but has never gone beyond the quarterfinals at a major. She first ascended to No. 1 in doubles in 2014, winning Wimbledon in 2013 and the French Open in 2014, both with Peng Shuai. She won her second Wimbledon in 2019 with Barbora Strycova and her third with Mertens two years later. After leaving the tour for nearly 18 months at the end of 2021 to heal a nagging muscle strain in her leg that had her contemplating retirement, Hsieh returned in April of last year and has now won three of the last four majors, each with a different partner. At last year’s French Open, she paired with Wang Xinyu, who is nearly 16 years her junior, to win the championship. Hsieh then captured Wimbledon with Strycova. Last fall, after Strycova retired following the U.S. Open, Mertens messaged Hsieh and asked her to join forces for this season. The two promptly won the Australian Open in January (Hsieh also won the mixed doubles title with Jan Zielinski) and the doubles title at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells in March. That win helped her regain No. 1. “We really feel each other on the court and we have a lot of communication,” Mertens said. “It’s rare to find someone where you build toward each other and can also think, ‘Let’s improve together.’” ADVERTISEMENT Hsieh, who retired from singles play this spring, knows that her time on tour is running out, but she is not consumed by that fact. Nothing much bothers the native of Taipei, Taiwan, whose style of play, like her personality, is at times precise, explosive and crafty. Sometimes even she doesn’t know what shot she’ll hit and when. She hits with both hands off both sides, a style necessitated by her slight frame when she started playing with her father at age 5. She glides effortlessly to the net and perpetually eyes opportunities to sneak in and knock off volley winners. Her tour mates call her Wizard for her confounding shotmaking. Hsieh no longer has a steady coach, though Paul McNamee accompanies her to the majors, including this French Open. At home in Paris, where she has lived for almost a decade, she often practices with her boyfriend, Frederic Aniere, occasionally at Roland Garros. On the road she is sometimes joined by her brother, Hsieh Cheng-peng, and his tennis-playing children. She finds that having different voices in her ear helps keep the game fresh. Hsieh would love to represent Taiwan in the Paris Olympics this July, something she has not done since 2012 when she lost in the first round in singles and the quarterfinals in doubles. “Winning the Grand Slams is the first priority for me,” she said. “But I always want to win a medal for Taiwan. For me, that would be something special.” ADVERTISEMENT After traveling the world for nearly a quarter of a century, Hsieh was asked what kept her going. She let out a laugh. “That’s a good question, because I’m asking myself what I’m doing here,” she said. “I just try to enjoy first and the answer will come out someday. I’m not in a rush.” ADVERTISEMENT",True,True,True

A Fan Was Hit by a 110-M.P.H. Foul Ball. Now She’s on a Trading Card.,"A Fan Was Hit by a 110-M.P.H. Foul Ball. Now She’s on a Trading Card.  ADVERTISEMENT  The trading card maker Topps said it made 110 custom cards for Liz McGuire, who was hit by a ball at a game in Toronto on Friday between the Blue Jays and the Tampa Bay Rays. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Jesus Jiménez Liz McGuire was at a Blue Jays game in Toronto on Friday night, sitting on the third base line and talking with a friend, when a foul ball suddenly hurtled toward her at 110 miles per hour, striking her in the head and leaving a large lump above her right eye. McGuire, 40, didn’t get to keep the ball that hit her, but now, 110 personalized Topps baseball cards bearing a picture of her swollen forehead have been mailed to her. Bo Bichette, the Blue Jays shortstop, was up to bat during the late innings of Toronto’s game on Friday against the Tampa Bay Rays when he fouled off a pitch. The ball was fired over the protective netting in the lower bowl of Rogers Centre and behind the third base line, where McGuire was sitting with her friend. McGuire said she briefly turned her head away from the field to talk to her friend and didn’t see the ball barreling toward her. ADVERTISEMENT “I heard someone scream, and then it just hit me,” she said. The Blue Jays said in an email on Tuesday that McGuire was immediately attended to by medical workers at the ballpark, and that she decided to return to her seat to watch the rest of the game. “I know you have to be careful with foul lines, and I know better,” she said, adding that she attends games regularly. “But it was 110 miles per hour off the bat, and it came at me.” After McGuire posted pictures of her swollen face and the ensuing black eye on social media, she said Topps, the trading card company, contacted her and asked her permission to use one of the images on a custom card. Topps produced exactly 110 copies, a nod to the speed of the ball that hit McGuire. The cards have a picture of McGuire in Blue Jays gear with the large lump on her forehead. ADVERTISEMENT “Fan wears 110MPH foul ball like a champ,” the cards say. A spokeswoman for the Blue Jays said that the team had reached out to McGuire and invited her to an upcoming game. The team also offered her a ball signed by Bichette. “Fan safety is a priority and the Blue Jays have numerous precautions in place to ensure a safe environment for all fans at the ballpark,” the team said. McGuire said medical workers iced her head, but she wanted to watch the end of the game. (The Rays beat the Blue Jays 4-3.) “I was pretty breezy about the whole thing,” she said. But as her face started to swell, McGuire said she went to the emergency room after the game, and she was scanned for facial fractures. “It was so big,” she said of the swelling. Since Friday, McGuire said she has suffered headaches and nausea. She went back to the emergency room on Monday, but her CT scans were clear. ADVERTISEMENT “I probably just have a concussion, and a good story,” she said, adding that she bought two lottery tickets over the weekend. The odds of being struck by a ball or bat at a baseball game are low. By 2018, all Major League Baseball teams had extended the netting behind home plate and down the foul lines to keep fans safe. Baseball fans are warned about the dangers of flying objects at M.L.B. games. “Be alert!” the Blue Jays fan code of conduct says. “Prior to, during, and following the event, baseballs, bats, bat fragments and other objects may be thrown or hit into fan areas.” The code of conduct says that “by entering the stadium,” a fan attending a game “voluntarily assumes all risks and danger of any injury.” Despite the injury, McGuire is undeterred, she said, and has plans to return to Rogers Centre on Wednesday to see the Blue Jays play the Chicago White Sox. “It was such a freak accident,” she said. “I’m not going to let it shape my outlook of fandom.” Jesus Jiménez covers breaking news, online trends and other subjects.

Frédéric Vasseur’s Plan for Ferrari Begins to Pay Off,"Frédéric Vasseur’s Plan for Ferrari Begins to Pay Off  ADVERTISEMENT  As a Frenchman running a beloved Italian team, fans weren’t happy at first, but the team is now second for the constructors’ title. By Ian Parkes In January last year, Frédéric Vasseur started one of the toughest jobs in motorsports, team principal of the Ferrari Formula 1 team. It did not help that as a Frenchman, Vasseur was the first non-Italian to be appointed to the position since Jean Todt left in 2007. The Ferrari fans, known as Tifosi, were unhappy with the decision. In an episode of the Netflix documentary “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” they made their feelings known. “He’s never done this job,” one person said. “What the heck has he come here to do?” On Vasseur’s not speaking Italian, another said, “A team like Ferrari is a family. It’s important.” Vasseur said the fan reaction didn’t surprise him. “They have always been very positive, not necessarily with me, but with the team,” he said in an interview. ADVERTISEMENT “There are always people at the entrance of the factory in the morning, or the evening when I’m leaving, and they are all positive,” he added. “I have never had someone shout, ‘Ah, you are doing rubbish.’ The guys who are there are shouting, ‘Allez, allez, allez.’” Under Mattia Binotto, the previous team principal, Ferrari finished second in the constructors’ championship in 2022. Charles Leclerc was runner-up in the drivers’ standings. Last year, under Vasseur, Ferrari was third, Leclerc fifth and Carlos Sainz, his teammate, seventh. This season the results have improved as Vasseur pieces together a plan to help the team win its first championship since 2008. Leclerc and Sainz are now third and fifth in the drivers’ championship and have finished on the podium six times, including Sainz winning the Australian Grand Prix in March with Leclerc finishing second. The team is also second in the constructors’ championship behind Red Bull. “Short term, it’s more about putting everything together, to have a good team spirit,” Vasseur said. “You can reorganize some departments, to change people, but it is more a matter of mind-set at the end. We did it quite quickly last year, and it’s paying off. ADVERTISEMENT “As a team principal, you can quickly change the mentality, the ability to take risks, instill self-confidence. With this kind of team spirit, let’s call it, we made a decent step forward.” A Close Race: Max Verstappen is still firmly on top of the drivers’ championship, but McLaren is mounting a challenge for the team title. Keeping Drivers and Fans Safe: Silverstone’s medical team is “probably the best in the world for motor racing.” From Bombers to Racecars: The home of the British Grand Prix, a R.A.F. base during World War II, had its first race in 1948. An Attraction Beyond Racing: The historic track at Silverstone is no longer “just a motorsport circuit.” More on Formula 1: Stories about drivers, teams and issues. In Binotto’s final season of his four in charge, Ferrari made errors during Grands Prix, on strategy, in pit stops and from Leclerc that allowed Red Bull and Max Verstappen to comfortably win the titles. Vasseur joined Ferrari weeks before the start of the new season. He said that he never felt resistance to his appointment, but that with little time to integrate himself into the team, it was “quite brutal.” “I needed time to understand,” he said. “It’s very difficult to arrive at a team and say we are weak on this, this and this because it’s not just a matter of results. You need to understand the reasons. ADVERTISEMENT “If we are not doing good pit stops, or the strategy is not good, why? Is it a matter of people, tools, organization of the pit wall? You need to understand, to see them working together, and that takes a little bit of time.” After improving the team spirit in the short term, the mid- and long-term projects have involved strengthening the team. On the drivers’ side, Lewis Hamilton, a seven-time champion, will join Ferrari next year after 12 seasons with Mercedes. In the junior categories, en route to Formula 1, Hamilton won the Formula 3 Euro Series title in 2005 with ASM, led by Vasseur. The next year he was GP2 champion with ART GP, also under Vasseur. Hamilton said it was his “great relationship” with Vasseur that persuaded him to activate a release clause in his Mercedes contract that was to run until the end of 2025. “We had amazing success in F3 and GP2, and that’s really where the foundation of our relationship started,” Hamilton said. “We always remained in touch. I thought he was going to be an amazing team manager at some stage and progress to F1, but at the time, he wasn’t interested in that.” ADVERTISEMENT It was not until 2016 that Vasseur moved into Formula 1 as team principal, of Renault. He resigned after six months. Six months later he joined Sauber Motorsport as managing director and chief executive, and became team principal of the Sauber team. “It was really cool to see him step into that team,” Hamilton said. “Then when he got the job at Ferrari, I was just so happy for him.” The friendship between Hamilton and Vasseur was pivotal to his joining Ferrari. “The stars aligned, and I think it really wouldn’t have happened without him,” Hamilton said. “I’m really excited about the work he’s doing there.” To make way for Hamilton, Vasseur informed that Sainz he would be leaving at the end of this year. Sainz was the only driver to win a Grand Prix last season other than drivers from Red Bull. “I have huge respect for Carlos,” Vasseur said. “I’m perfectly aware of the job he did last year. He was the architect of our recovery after the summer break. He brought us the win in Singapore and the podium in Monza. ADVERTISEMENT “But for the team, being able to bring Lewis on board was a no-brainer for tons of reasons. I had to take a decision, and the decision was harsh. We closed the discussion by saying, ‘It is like it is. Let’s push until the last corner of the last lap and do a mega-good season.’” On the technical side, Loïc Serra, performance engineer at Mercedes, will join Ferrari next season. Adrian Newey, who has helped Red Bull win seven drivers’ and six constructors’ titles during his 19 seasons with the team, is leaving the team early next year. Hamilton said it would be a privilege to work with Newey. “If I was to make a list of people I would love to work with, he would absolutely be at the top of it,” he said. Leclerc said Newey was someone “who can make a difference.” Newey said he was “going to take a little bit of a break and see what happens next.” Vasseur would not comment on whether he would sign Newey, but was aware that important hires take time. “The recruitment of people is very long,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Leclerc, who signed a new contract with Ferrari in January, said the team was “in a very good moment” with Vasseur in charge. “Fred has always shared with me his medium- to long-term vision of the team, and it’s going really well,” Leclerc said. “I’m really happy with how it is going. We are in a good place to attract the best people in the world. “I have said it before, but we are a really good team already, and in the last seven, eight months, we’ve made incredible progress. Whoever now comes in to make us even stronger is super important.” Vasseur said his time in charge had been “very demanding,” not just for him but also “for every single team member.” ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t want to say that I won’t take harsh decisions, but at least on the difficult days, it’s much easier to smile than to not smile,” he said. When the “Drive to Survive” episode on Ferrari ran in February, the fans’ perception of Vasseur had changed. “I have a lot of faith in Vasseur,” one fan said in the episode. Another added, “He can bring Ferrari back to where it deserves to be.” ADVERTISEMENT",True,True,True
"At the P.G.A. Championship, Club Pros Can Get Their Day in the Sun","At the P.G.A. Championship, Club Pros Can Get Their Day in the Sun  ADVERTISEMENT  They have the opportunity to play their way into the field. Michael Block did it last year and impressed the sport by finishing 15th. By Paul Sullivan Michael Block, the club professional from Southern California, electrified the crowds at last year’s P.G.A. Championship at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, N.Y., holding his own against the best touring professionals in the world. But after making the cut, his first hole didn’t bode well for a successful weekend. “I had 25 feet — the easiest two-putt in the world — and I three-putt it,” Block recalled last week. “I started to think, ‘Oh no, this is how it’s going to go today.’ As we’re walking off the green, Justin Rose puts his arm around me and said, ‘Let’s settle in, Blockie, and have a good day.’ For him to say that?” Rose, a major champion and Ryder Cup stalwart, was like so many other people at last year’s P.G.A.: supportive of a magical, if improbable run. Block, 46 at the time, did settle in and eventually finished tied for 15th, which got him an automatic invitation into this week’s P.G.A. Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky. But more than the highest finish for any country club pro in the modern era of the P.G.A. Championship, he captivated the audience, inspired other club pros and earned the respect of touring pros who saw how well Block, who had been running his pro shop a week earlier, could play. ADVERTISEMENT “Watching Michael Block do what Michael Block did gave all of us this inner sense that it’s doable,” said Matt Dobyns, the head golf professional at the Meadow Brook Club in Jericho, N.Y., who will be making his sixth start in the P.G.A. Championship this week. “That’s part of the challenge for us — believing you can do it. I’ve played with Michael. He’s a great player, but I can play with him.” “His play gives you this glimmer that it’s possible,” Dobyns added. “It’s tough when you have a full-time job and playing golf is just one part of it.” Each major has a way for players who are not exempt to gain entry. The Masters Tournament has a history of inviting great amateurs and international players. The United States and British Open championships have qualification processes where anyone of a certain ability can try to play their way into the tournaments. ADVERTISEMENT For the P.G.A. Championship, that group is the 30,000 P.G.A. of America members — the men and women working at golf shops at clubs — who can play their way in through sectional tournaments that lead up to the P.G.A. Professional Championship, which was held in late April this year at the P.G.A. of America’s new headquarters in Frisco, Texas. Of the nearly 3,800 club pros who entered this year, 312 played on the first day of the championship. The top 20 finishers and those who tied earned invitations to the P.G.A. Championship. “It’s an incredible experience for them, and it’s wonderful to see them participate and compete,” said Kerry Haigh, the chief championships officer for the P.G.A. of America. Typically, he said, a club pro might make a run on the Thursday or Friday of the tournament, but he couldn’t remember any finishing higher than 40th or 50th. Haigh said one thing that might help club pros compete is the proximity of their professional championship to the major. Before the P.G.A. Championship moved to May a few years ago, there were months, not weeks, between the two. In golf, as in all sports, the hot hand can carry players through. “Michael was playing well last year at the P.G.A. Professional Championship, and he played incredibly well in the P.G.A. Championship,” Haigh said. Block finished tied for second in the pro championship to get into last year’s P.G.A. ADVERTISEMENT What is remarkable for any club professional who plays well at this year’s second major this week is all the other things that compete for their attention. Ben Polland, the director of golf at Shooting Star of Jackson Hole, said the timing definitely helps him. He doesn’t play many rounds in the winter — not least of all because his golf club becomes a ski club and his pro shop gets converted into a ski chalet. “I guarantee you I’ve played the least amount of golf in that tournament,” said Polland, who won this year’s P.G.A. Professional Championship and will be making his fourth start in the P.G.A. Championship. “We hang up the clubs in the fall and go skiing. We hit some balls in the simulator and go on a few member trips, but it’s more low key.” Polland said he had about a month to prepare for the professional championship. It didn’t show. He bested the field in windy, difficult conditions to win by three shots. His prep had been seven rounds with members, though a few of them were a team competition at Pebble Beach Golf Links. “The swing that I found over the period was what I brought to that tournament,” he said. But what about the distracting banter with members in the events? “It’s a switch you can turn on,” he said of competition. “Michael Block can shoot the breeze with anyone, but then he gets into competition and he flips a switch. I’ll always play my best in a tournament when I’m focused.” ADVERTISEMENT Dobyns said previous experiences had helped him find a way to prepare for this week. On the Mondays of major week, he assesses the course and plans his strategy. On Tuesday he works on his swing. By Wednesday, on the eve of the championship, he just plays nine holes to simulate what it’s going to be like the next morning. Even after that routine, this week’s championship is so different from anything these club pros play in all year. “You can’t simulate what it’s like to walk into a major,” Dobyns said. “We do a good job at the professional championship. But it’s nothing like walking through the gates at Valhalla. It’s like going from a Little League park to Fenway [where the Boston Red Sox play].” For Block, this past year has been unlike anything in his long professional career. “I haven’t given a single lesson since that day,” he said. “I used to give four a day. I’ve been out of town so much that I had to hand off my students to other instructors.” He credits the membership at his club, Arroyo Trabuco Golf Club, for supporting him and the club’s general manager, Matthew Donovan, for helping him with the logistics of these tournaments. ADVERTISEMENT “It’s been a whirlwind year,” he said. “I’ve traveled more in the last 12 months than my first 46 years combined. It’s been insane, but you also know it’s not going to last forever.” He admits that he’s feeling more pressure coming into this year’s tournament than last year when few knew who he was. “People think I can do it again,” he said. He’s just hoping the fans will be behind him again. “I like a crowd. The crowd is a huge part for me. I want to hear them cheering.” Yet Block, who has been a club pro since 2012, said he told everyone there are fundamental differences that separate touring pros from top club pros: power and consistency. “You watch Scottie Scheffler [the world No. 1] — it’s unreal what he does on very, very difficult golf courses week after week,” Block said. “That’s what puts them apart from everyone else in the world.” ADVERTISEMENT Dobyns said that touring pros did everything 5 percent better than the best club pros and that adds up to nearly two strokes a round. “It’s the difference between winning and finishing 45th,” he said. As for this week’s P.G.A. Championship, Block has the same goal of every club pro in the field: to make the cut and play the weekend. “After that,” he said, “we’ll just see where everything else falls.” Paul Sullivan, the Wealth Matters columnist from 2008 to 2021, is the founder of The Company of Dads, a work and parenting site aimed at fathers.

Carrie Underwood is returning to 'American Idol' as judge,"Carrie Underwood is returning to 'American Idol' as judge, replacing Katy Perry          Carrie Underwood is returning to her “American Idol” roots. The country music superstar and former “Idol” Season Four winner is the new judge for the franchise’s 23rd season, ABC announced Aug. 1. Underwood replaces Katy Perry and joins Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan on the judging panel. The new season, hosted by Ryan Seacrest, will air spring 2025 on ABC and Hulu. The news was also announced with a special video, showing a yet-undiscovered Underwood preparing to audition for “American Idol” 20 years ago. As the video collage shows her “going to Hollywood” and performing on the “American Idol” stage, the now-41-year-old singer reflects on her life-changing moment. “I went from nobody knowing my name to tens of millions of people watching the show,” she says in the clip. “I’m proud of everything that I was able to accomplish on the show and I’m so proud of everything that I’ve accomplished since.” The announcement concludes with the message: “Welcome American Idol’s newest judge.” It’s a full-circle moment for the multi-Grammy winning singer, who auditioned for the show in 2004 and won the judges over when she sang Bonnie Raitt’s “I Can’t Make You Love Me.” Underwood went on to win America over as well, beating runner-up Bo Bice in the 2005 finale. Underwood is the first “American Idol” alum ever to join the panel of judges. However, this isn’t the “Cowboy Casanova” singer’s first time back on the show: She’s previously been a guest mentor and performed during the 2019 finale. The singer is known for celebrating her “American Idol” anniversaries on her social media. In May, she shared a photo of herself when she got her golden ticket to Hollywood. “REFLECTION of the week: contestant number #14887 received her golden ticket to Hollywood!” she captioned her Instagram post. “I can’t believe it has been almost 20 years since auditioning for @AmericanIdol!” Auditions for the upcoming season of “American Idol” are happening in Alabama on Monday, Aug. 12, and then around the United States with the return of “Idol Across America,” the live virtual nationwide search for the next superstar. Perry, who had been a judge since the show relaunched on ABC in 2018 after 15 seasons on Fox, announced in February that she would be departing “American Idol” after Season 22. Artists like Meghan Trainor, former “Idol” winner Fantasia Barrino and “Idol” alum Jordin Sparks had been contenders for Perry’s replacement before Underwood was officially announced. © 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL",True,True,True

The video flashed to throwback photos of Princess Diana in a pale pink version of the frock and was overlaid with audio from The Devil Wears Prada. Waterhouse mimed the dialogue from the 2006 comedy where Anne Hathaway's character told Emily Blunt's character, ""Yeah, I am"" wearing ""the Chanel boots"" after her makeover. In text displayed on the video, the Daisy Jones & the Six star replaced the movie lines with her own version: ""The Zandra Rhodes dress that Diana wore to dinner in Kyoto? Yeah...I am."" The Zandra Rhodes brand confirmed the provenance of Waterhouse's look on Instagram, explaining that the ""it girl"" was wearing the label's ""Buttons and Bows"" dress from 1986.  The dress came to be after Princess Diana popped into the label's London shop and was struck by the design for the dress, which was planned to be made in black with a fluorescent pink print. The designer suggested switching the colors to pink and white, and Diana commissioned the combination. It was later made for her following two fittings at her Kensington Palace apartment, and the color scheme and print were kept exclusive to her, Kerry Taylor Auctions reported. ANWAR HUSSEIN/GETTY The ethereal look with off-the-shoulder neckline, beading and zigzag hem apparently became a favorite in her royal rotation, and the Princess of Wales wore it to a Torvill and Dean party in 1985, an official state visit to Japan with the future King Charles in 1986 and a benefit for the London City Ballet in 1987.  A decade later, the Zandra Rhodes dress was part of the lot at the Christie’s of New York auction Diana held shortly before her tragic death in 1997. In 2011, it changed hands once more and was bought by Historic Royal Palaces for almost $32,000, the Daily Mail reported. BRENDAN BEIRNE/SHUTTERSTOCK The dress was later displayed at Kensington Palace, Princess Diana's former home in London, for the Fashion Rules exhibit in 2016.

While speaking to Forbes in 2021, Rhodes reflected on what it was like to work with Princess Diana and the practical mindset she had about how things should fit.

She said that the photographers would always be there to get the wrong angle!"" the designer told the outlet, adding that the royal didn't need to do much to make an outfit pop.

Their newly-announced trip to Colombia will take place ahead of the first World Ministerial Conference on the Elimination of Violence Against Children, being held in the South American country this November. Francia Márquez, Colombia's vice president and the first Black woman to hold the position, said in a statement, ""The conference will present a global framework for creating safer physical and virtual spaces, addressing issues such as cyberbullying, online exploitation and the impact of these threats on mental health. It will offer practical solutions and commitments for countries around the world. During their visit, the Duke and Duchess, as well as the Archewell Foundation, will take part in a number of activities related to this important topic.""

""Over the past few years, we have spent time with many of these families, listening to their heartache and their hopes for the urgent change that is needed in the online space.

The son of Asia’s richest man gets married in the year’s most extravagant wedding,"Son of Asia's richest man gets married in the year's most extravagant wedding  Watch CBS News July 13, 2024 / 1:36 PM EDT / AP The youngest son of Mukesh Ambani, Asia's richest man, married his longtime girlfriend early Saturday in what many dubbed the wedding of the year, attended by global celebrities, business tycoons and politicians, highlighting the billionaire's staggering wealth and rising clout. The wedding rituals, including exchanging garlands by the couple and walking around the sacred fire, began Friday and were completed past midnight. The celebrations of Anant Ambani marrying Radhika Merchant took place at the Ambani-owned Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai and the family home. The marriage culminated months of wedding events that featured performances by pop stars including Rihanna and Justin Bieber. Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended a reception organized by the Ambanis on Saturday evening. The Ambanis hosted a ""blessing ceremony'' for friends and family members to meet the couple and wish them a happy married life. India Today television news channel reported that the newlyweds touched Modi's feet as a show of respect and sought his blessings. The four-day wedding celebrations began Friday with the traditional Hindu wedding ceremony and will be followed by a grand reception to run through the weekend. The guest list includes former British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson; John Kerry, the former U.S. special envoy for climate, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin H. Nasser; and Adele, Lana Del Rey, Drake and David Beckham, according to local media. The Ambani family did not confirm the guest list. Television news channels showed the arrivals of celebrities like Kim Kardashian, who was dressed in red, and professional wrestler and Hollywood actor John Cena. Kardashian sisters Kim and Khloé took a ride in a motorized rickshaw through bustling Mumbai streets Friday before joining the wedding ceremonies, the Press Trust of India news agency said. International guests wore traditional clothes by major Indian fashion designers. They put on embroidered sherwanis - long-sleeved outer coats worn by men in South Asia. Cena came in a sky-blue sherwani and white pants. Nick Jonas wore a pink sherwani and white pants. Bollywood icons Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Ranbir Kapoor attended the wedding and danced to popular Hindi movie songs. Indian cricketers, including icons Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav, were among the invitees. Police imposed traffic diversions around the wedding venue from Friday to Monday to handle the influx of guests who flew to Mumbai, where heavy monsoon rains have caused flooding and flight disruptions for the past week. The extravaganza and the display of opulence that comes with the wedding have led many to raise questions about rising inequality in India, where the gap between rich and poor is growing. The event has also sparked anger among some Mumbai residents, who say they are struggling with snarled traffic. ""It affects our earnings. I don't care much about the wedding,"" said Vikram, a taxi driver who uses only one name. The father of the groom, Mukesh Ambani, is the world's ninth-richest man, with a net worth of $116 billion, according to Forbes. He is the richest person in Asia. His Reliance Industries is a conglomerate reporting over $100 billion in annual revenue, with interests that include petrochemicals, oil and gas, telecoms and retail. The Ambani family owns, among other assets, a 27-story family compound in Mumbai worth $1 billion. The building contains three helipads, a 160-car garage and a private movie theater. The groom, 29-year-old Anant, oversees the conglomerate's renewable and green energy expansion. He also runs a 3,000-acre (about 1,200-hectare) animal rescue center in Gujarat state's Jamnagar, the family's hometown. The bride, Radhika Merchant, also 29, is the daughter of pharmaceutical tycoon Viren Merchant and is the marketing director for his company, Encore Healthcare, according to Vogue. Ambani's critics say his company has relied on political connections during Congress Party-led governments in the 1970s and '80s, and under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rule after 2014. The Ambani family's pre-wedding celebrations have been lavish and star-studded from the start. In March, they threw a three-day prenuptial bash for Anant that had 1,200 guests, including former world leaders, tech tycoons and Bollywood megastars, and performances by Rihanna, Akon and Diljit Dosanjh, a Punjabi singer who shot to international fame when he performed at Coachella. The event was also attended by tech billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. It was the start of lavish, months-long pre-wedding celebrations that grabbed headlines and set off a social media frenzy. In May, the family took guests on a three-day cruise from Italy to France, which included Katy Perry singing her hit song ""Firework"" and a performance by Pitbull, according to media reports. The family also organized a mass wedding for more than 50 underprivileged couples on July 2 as part of the celebrations. Last week, Justin Bieber performed for hundreds of guests at a pre-wedding concert that included performances by Bollywood stars Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh and Salman Khan. Ambani also made headlines in 2018, when Beyoncé performed at pre-wedding festivities for his daughter. Former U.S. Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among those who rubbed shoulders with Indian celebrities and Bollywood stars in the western Indian city of Udaipur. © 2024 The Associated Press.

"Aerosmith retires from touring, says full recovery for Steven Tyler's vocal injury 'not possible'","Aerosmith retires from touring, says full recovery for Steven Tyler's vocal injury 'not possible'          Aerosmith, one of rock's top-selling acts, announced the end of its touring days Friday, saying that lead singer Steven Tyler's vocal injury has proven to be enduring and that he’ll never fully recover. The band launched its “Peace Out: The Farewell Tour” in May 2023 but postponed dates after just a few shows, when Tyler suffered an injured larynx. The band said in a statement Friday that Tyler has spent months working to get his voice back to how it had been. ""We’ve seen him struggling despite having the best medical team by his side. Sadly, it is clear, that a full recovery from his vocal injury is not possible,"" it said. ""We have made a heartbreaking and difficult, but necessary, decision — as a band of brothers — to retire from the touring stage."" It's not clear if the end of touring for Aerosmith means the end of live performance. Other big-name acts have dangled the possibility of a last-ever tour, amassing ticket sales only to return to music venues. That doesn't seem to be the case for Aerosmith, which has made attempts to complete its latest tour, putting it back on the calendar later this year. Performances were ultimately pushed to this September before Friday’s announcement. The last show of the tour took place on Sept. 9, 2023, in Elmont, New York. Aerosmith's last album was released in 2012. The band suggested it would be difficult to replicate its telltale sound without Tyler’s extraordinary and often raspy voice. “Steven’s voice is an instrument like no other,” it said in its announcement. Aerosmith has sold more than 150 million records, according to Billboard, placing 28 songs on the Billboard Top 100 and one at the No. 1 position — 1998's soundtrack hit ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" from ""Armageddon."" The band's music quickly became a staple of FM radio, thanks to the success of its self-titled debut and the hit, ""Dream On."" In 1986, Aerosmith collided with hip-hop juggernaut Run-DMC for a rap version of its 1975 track ""Walk This Way,"" tapping a new generation of fans and alienating a few of its original ones. Concert industry publication Pollstar ranks the band at No. 31 on its “Top Touring Artists of the Pollstar Era” chart, which measures acts based on gross ticket sales between July 7, 1980, and July 1, 2022. Aerosmith's gross draw for that time, it said, is $603 million. ""We are grateful beyond words for everyone who was pumped to get on the road with us one last time,"" the band said Friday. ""You've made our dreams come true.""  Dennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital. © 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL",True,True,True
"Justin Timberlake's license suspended at DWI hearing, judge threatens gag order for lawyer","Justin Timberlake's license suspended at DWI hearing, judge threatens gag order for lawyer          SAG HARBOR, N.Y. — Justin Timberlake appeared virtually at a Friday hearing for his driving while intoxicated case, where the judge announced the pop star’s driver’s license would be suspended and admonished his lawyer over “irresponsible” comments. Timberlake, 43, wore a black collared shirt for his appearance via video conference from Antwerp, Belgium. Sag Harbor Justice Carl Irace reprimanded the musician’s attorney, Edward Burke Jr., for “irresponsible” comments he made at the last court hearing, adding that it “comes off as an attempt to poison the case before it even begins.” The judge even threatened to issue a gag order if the attorney continued to make such comments. It's not clear which comments the judge was referring to. After considering a motion to dismiss the case against Timberlake, the judge suspended the singer’s license in New York state because he refused to take a breathalyzer test on June 18 when he was pulled over. The license will be suspended for the pendency of the case, according to Burke Jr. The hearing lasted roughly half an hour, ending with Irace again admonishing Burke, urging him to “raise the bar, not lower it.” Burke Jr., spoke to reporters after the hearing, saying that he plans on ""filing motions"" and letting ""the content of those motions and the arguments contained therein speak for themselves.""  Burke Jr., also maintained Timberlake's claim that he was not intoxicated when he was pulled over. When asked about the judge potentially issuing a gag order against him, Burke Jr., said he doesn't see that happening. ""Hey, we all have jobs to do, and we’re obligated to zealously defend our clients, and that’s what I plan on doing,"" he said. The hearing in Sag Harbor, New York, came more than a month after Timberlake was pulled over after he failed field sobriety tests and was arrested on suspicion of intoxicated driving early morning on a Tuesday in the affluent Hamptons area of Long Island. The singer claimed he had just “one martini” before he was pulled over. He pleaded not guilty and his attorney Burke said in a statement at the time: “I look forward to vigorously defending Mr. Timberlake on these allegations. I will have a lot to say at the appropriate time but am currently awaiting full discovery from the District Attorney’s office.” Timberlake was behind the wheel of a gray Florida-registered BMW when he was stopped a little after 12:15 a.m. that Tuesday morning near Madison Street and Middle Line Highway, initially for driving through a stop sign and failing to stay on the right side of the road, according to the criminal complaint. But once police spoke to Timberlake, they said, it was clear he was not in shape to drive, according to the complaint, written by Sag Harbor Village police officer Michael Arkinson. It was “ascertained that the defendant was operating said vehicle in an intoxicated condition in that his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot, and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests,” Arkinson wrote. Timberlake struggled to walk heel-to-toe and stand on one foot without swaying or using arms to balance, the report said. The officer quoted Timberlake as saying: “I had one martini and I followed my friends home.” He also declined to be tested for impairment, said police, who alleged he told them, “No, I’m not doing a chemical test.” NBC News legal analyst Danny Cevallos said: “A refusal can be introduced at trial to establish conscious evidence of guilt. It is the predicate for a revocation of driving privileges.” Timberlake had dined at the American Hotel in Sag Harbor “and then headed to a friend’s house when he was pulled over by police,” a source close to him said. The next conference is set for Aug. 9, which Timberlake is not required to appear for. Another hearing is planned for Sept. 13 but may not take place depending on what happens in August, Burke Jr. said. Timberlake may be required to attend the September date.

Since December, Cardi and the Migos star have spent time together on New Year's Eve, Offset directed her March music video for ""Like What (Freestyle),"" the two caught a Knicks game together in May, and that same month, Rolling Stone published an interview in which Cardi said the pair was ""all right now.""

Admitting that she was currently trying to look for a nanny at the time, the proud mom said she'd been leaning on her parents for support, but was worried about putting too much pressure on them.

While she initially thought it was all because of her heavy teeth grinding, an oral surgeon discovered a tumor under her tongue while treating the ulcers. “A few days later,” she wrote, “I was diagnosed.” Chung goes on to say she was “very calm” when she first heard the news, adding that she’s always been someone who thrives under pressure: “I was extremely focused on getting all the tests and scans as fast as possible, so I can start on the treatment plans.” Then, reality set in on June 2, when her oncologist called to discuss treatment plans. “I broke down, crying, trying to put thoughts together and ask questions but physically couldn’t, all I heard was ‘option 1, surgery, 100% removal of your tongue,’” Chung wrote. She then heard about a “unicorn case” out of the University of Chicago, where another chef, Grant Achatz, was cured using radiation and chemotherapy. “I still don’t understand how surgeons say, the only anything we can do is cut your tongue out; we have to cut your tongue out, first step, cut your tongue out,” Daniel J. Haraf, medical director of radiation and oncology at UChicago Medicine said in an interview. “And I go, why should that be the first step?” While Chung was aware that tongue removal had a higher success rate, that didn’t matter as much to the TV personality. “Higher survival rate, or keep my tongue? I chose to keep my tongue,” Chung said. “I am a fighter, I am a chef, I can be that unicorn too.” So, she headed to Chicago and, as of Friday, finished her first six weeks of chemo, with “many more to go.” She called her four-times-weekly trips to the hospital “a full time job,” and said it’s been working so far. “My tumor is shrinking, my speech is much better and I can eat most normal food now,” she added. Chung, who immigrated to the U.S. at 17 years old, had a Silicon Valley career prior to becoming a chef. She then worked her way through different restaurant groups until she opened her own modern Chinese restaurant in Orange County, California, called Twenty Eight. She was a contestant on seasons 11 (where she made it into the top three) and 14 (runner up) of Bravo’s “Top Chef.” She said through the trials that come with fighting cancer, she’s learned to lean on others and accept support, “to let go, to be more vulnerable.” It took her two weeks to decide whether she should tell her parents about the diagnosis, and until Friday, the only other people who knew were her “close circle of friends” and her sister. “I am learning, I can be strong 98% of the time, it’s ok to be not ok,” she wrote. “I have a long road to recovery in front of me. Your love and support will carry me through. Cheer me on, Shirley Chung 2.0 will be reborn in 2025!” Her cheering section got loud, with friends and chefs like Alex Guarnaschelli, Kardea Brown, Aarti Sequeira and Jet Tila leaving supportive comments on the post. Guarnaschelli told Chung to not “be a chef at this time,” but instead “be a person who’s cool with getting support and love.” “Can I just speak to the person you are,” Brown wrote in the comments. The chef said she met Chung the day before she received her treatment plan, “but we had no clue about the battle you were fighting.” She continued on, writing about how Chung cooked that night and “had the biggest smile on your face the entire time,” which she wrote “speaks volumes about your character.” “This cancer clearly hasn’t met Shirley Chung,” Sequeira wrote. “Like, why would you even try?” A seemingly endless stream of other chefs — Andrew Zimmern, Gregory Gourdet, Nina Compton, Leah Cohen, Michael Voltaggio and more — chimed in as well with words of encouragement and support.

Rapper-actor Chino XL dies at 50,"Rapper-Actor Chino XL Dies at 50   Rapper-actor Chino XL died Sunday at his home, according to a statement from his family. No cause of death had been announced at the time of this article’s publication; he was 50. The Bronx-born rapper, whose real name was Derek Keith Barbosa, is survived by his children, Chynna, Bella, Lyric and Kiyana; stepson Shawn; five grandchildren; his mother and his longtime partner Stephanie. In a joint statement, his daughters wrote: “Our father had many titles — King of Punchlines, Puerto Rican Superhero — but the most important one was Girl Dad. And what he gave us most in that role was his strength, straightforwardness, and ability to be super realistic. The main thing we are feeling now is that our Dad is at peace, and so we are at peace.”   Throughout his career, the rapper known as the “Lyrical Messiah” built his cachet as a respected emcee, releasing four solo albums and several collaborative projects. Along with standout freestyles on Sway and King Tech’s Wake Up Show and a short stint on Rick Rubin’s American Recordings, he forayed into acting with roles in Rob Reiner’s “Alex & Emma” and on “Reno 911!”  Born in 1974, Barbosa grew up in East Orange, New Jersey, where he became a rapper in school and took on “Chino” based on his childhood nickname. In the late 1980s, he joined forces with producer Kerri Chandler to form the duo the Art of Origin. They signed with Rick Rubin’s Def American Recordings via Warner Bros. in 1991 and after releasing singles, Chino XL embarked on a solo career. He released his debut album, “Here to Save You All,” in 1996, and followed with “I Told You So,” which featured collaborations with Cypress Hill’s B-Real, Kool G Rap, and J Dilla, among others; he later gained the rights to the album and re-released it independently. A series of albums followed over the next 20 years: “Poison Pen” (2006), “Something Sacred,” a collaboration with Playalitical (2008), “Ricanstruction: The Black Rosary” (2012), “Chino vs. Balt” with Balthazar Getty (2020), and “God’s Carpenter,” a collaboration with Stu Bangas (2023). Chino most recently made an appearance on Rakim’s latest project “G.O.D.’s Network (Reb7rth),” which released on July 26. He’s featured on the track “Pendulum Swing” featuring Kxng Crooked, Canibus and LA the Darkman.  Notably, Chino became embroiled with Tupac Shakur prior to his passing due to a line he included on his 1996 song “Riiiot!” Shakur namedropped Chino on his classic diss song “Hit ‘Em Up,” prompting Chino to release his own response diss. It was unclear if the two settled their differences before Shakur’s death. He signed with Hollywood manager Stacey Castro and started working as an actor in the early 2000s, appearing in Reiner’s “Alex & Emma” as a flamenco dancer opposite Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson. He also acted in Brandon Sonnier’s 2003 hip-hop film “The Beat,” which premiered at Sundance and counted Coolio and Brian McKnight in its cast. On the small screen, he appeared on “Reno 911!,” “CSI: Miami” and “The Young and the Restless.” More recently, he branched out as an author of graphic novels, including “Black Mass,” “Lucy” and “Skin and Bones: The Descent of the Holy.” 0 Comments Comments are moderated.

Chappell Roan's success marks the rise of the 'middle class' pop star,"Chappell Roan's success marks the rise of the 'middle class' pop star          Chappell Roan is no longer just “your favorite artist’s favorite artist.” After a string of viral festival performances — videos of which showed massive crowds growing week after week — the once-niche pop singer has ascended to mainstream success. Roan, who is known for the queer themes in her music and her drag-inspired aesthetic, is among the recent crop of artists who have hit unforeseen career highs in recent months, despite being considered part of pop music’s “middle class.” This designation has typically been associated with artists who have cultivated devout online fan bases, but who are not necessarily household names. A-list pop stardom has become increasingly difficult to achieve. But some music industry experts say the recent rise of Roan and others — including Sabrina Carpenter, Tinashe and Charli XCX — is a testament to their authenticity and ability to foster such strong fandoms. Pop stardom used to be about creating music for the widest possible audience, said Louis Mandelbaum, better known as DJ Louie XIV and the host of “Pop Pantheon,” a podcast that dissects and ranks pop stars’ legacies. “There were indie bands that could kind of build local audiences and there were other types of music where you could have more of a niche career,” said Mandelbaum. “But when it came to sort of being a pop star, there was really only this one way to operate.” As a diverse array of genres have risen in popularity, artists are able to find success — to varying degrees — with niche sounds. Taking a look at the top 10 of Billboard’s Hot 100 songs chart, the genres often span from country to rap to pop — and beyond. Mandelbaum pointed out that some of the most popular artists today, such as Billie Eilish or SZA, make music that may not be recognizable to the general public. “That was not true of, you know, ‘Teenage Dream’ [by Katy Perry] or ‘Escapade’ [by Janet Jackson] or ‘Don’t Stop ‘til You Get Enough’ [by Michael Jackson],” Mandelbaum said. Instead of being “pop” as in popular across the culture, artists like Roan, XCX, Carpenter and Tinashe treat “pop” as a genre to be built upon rather than a trending sound. Morgan Milardo, managing and artistic director of the Berklee Popular Music Institute, said live performances have also been integral in creating communities around these artists. Roan’s debut album, “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” which came out in September, did not appear on the Billboard 200 albums chart in its opening week, according to the outlet. It only entered the chart in April 2024, following Roan’s stint as an opener for Olivia Rodrigo. Her album has slowly climbed to the top 10 of the Billboard 200. She also has multiple songs on the Hot 100. Milardo pointed to the decision to move Roan to a bigger stage at the Bonnaroo music festival following the turnout for her set at the Governors Ball festival as another sign of her ascendance. “Moving an artist based on a festival that they performed the week before is pretty unheard of,” said Milardo, who has worked on the festival circuit. “And so that growth, the metrics, the streaming data, watching it skyrocket through the roof after each festival, that’s not a coincidence.” Carpenter, who snagged the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time with her hit “Please Please Please,” also rose in popularity after opening for Taylor Swift and performing midday at the same big festivals as Roan. She was recently chosen to replace Tyler, the Creator as a headliner at Outside Lands, a move Milardo said usually takes a couple years for an artist of Carpenter’s stature to achieve. “It’s like we’re seeing the direct correlation and the direct connection between what’s happening on the charts and what’s happening on streaming platforms versus what’s happening in touring, and specifically the festival circuit,” said Milardo. It is also impossible to divorce the success of these stars from the current cultural and political climate, according to Milardo. The authenticity of these artists, who are known for being brash and unapologetically themselves, is refreshing at a time when the rights of women and LGBTQ people are being threatened. “Part of why they attract such a loyal fan base is because they’re allowing their fans to be authentic too, and they’re developing community and creating camaraderie for their fans,” said Milardo. Charli XCX, the British pop star considered a cult favorite among music fans, snagged her highest-charting album to date with her club record “Brat,” which dropped on June 7. The album has inspired people to aspire to a “brat summer,” which encourages them to be messy, candid and unapologetic. Mandelbaum said pop music fans crave “idiosyncratic” musicians today. With Roan in particular, Mandelbaum said, “her identity and her music is speaking to something deep inside of youth culture right now, particularly as it pertains to the representation of queer people in mainstream pop.” This synergy has made Roan “the right person for the right time” and allowed her to break through in a way pop musicians have not done in a while, said Mandelbaum. Even with the recent wave of success these artists have achieved, the standard rules of pop stardom have not been imperative to their overall career. Hit singles are “almost incidental,” said Mandelbaum. “It’s about speaking to this cult fan base directly,” Mandelbaum said, “and making idiosyncratic music that pleases them.” Daysia Tolentino is a culture and internet reporter for NBC News. © 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL",True,True,True
Johnny Cash statue to be unveiled in U.S. Capitol in September,"Johnny Cash statue to be unveiled in U.S. Capitol in September          A statue honoring country music icon Johnny Cash will be unveiled in the U.S. Capitol next month, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced Thursday. The statue will be the second of an Arkansas native in the Capitol, a news release states. A statue of Daisy Bates, a civil rights leader who headed Arkansas' chapter of the NAACP and mentored the Black students known as the Little Rock Nine who integrated Central High School in 1957, was unveiled in National Statuary Hall on May 8. Cash's and Bates' statues replaced ones depicting Uriah Rose, a 19th-century attorney, and James P. Clarke, a former governor and U.S. senator in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Both statutes drew criticism, especially over racist remarks Clarke made calling on the Democratic Party to preserve ""white standards."" Cash was born in 1932 in Kingsland, a small town about 60 miles south of Little Rock. He died at the age of 71 in 2003 from complications from diabetes. The musician sold 90 million records worldwide spanning country, blues, rock and gospel. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. Throughout his career, Cash was the recipient of numerous awards including 13 Grammy Awards and 9 Country Music Association Awards. The 8-foot-tall statue of Cash, created by Little Rock sculptor Kevin Kresse, shows the singer with a guitar slung across his back and a Bible in his hand. The unveiling ceremony will take place Sept. 24 in Emancipation Hall. Johnson, Jeffries, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders and Cash's family are scheduled to be in attendance.

Britney Spears biopic in the works at Universal,"Britney Spears biopic in the works at Universal          Britney Spears' memoir is headed to the big screen. Universal Pictures announced Thursday that it has landed the rights to a biopic based on the singer's 2023 best-selling book, ""The Woman in Me."" (NBC News and Universal are both part of Comcast.) The film will be directed by Jon M. Chu, who is gearing up for the November release of his highly anticipated film “Wicked,” starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. Marc Platt will produce, Universal said in its news release. Spears posted on X that she's ""excited"" to share with fans ""a secret project"" she's been working on with Platt. ""He's always made my favorite movies ... stay tuned,"" she wrote. The news of the film was first reported by The Ankler. A source familiar with the deal told NBC News that Spears will be “involved” with the project but did not elaborate on whether she will have direction on creative. Spears' memoir, released in October 2023, recounted Spears' rise to fame and her controversial 13-year conservatorship.

The 1975 sued over singer Matty Healy’s same-sex kiss protesting Malaysia’s anti-LGBTQ laws,"The 1975 is sued over singer Matty Healy’s same-sex kiss in protest of Malaysia’s anti-LGBTQ laws          Organizers of the Malaysia-based Good Vibes Festival are suing the British rock band The 1975 and its members, saying the group violated prohibitions by sharing a same-sex kiss while performing in Kuala Lumpur last year. The band, whose members include Matty Healy, Adam Hann, Ross MacDonald and George Daniel, headlined on the first date of the three-day festival in July 2023. Healy and MacDonald shared a kiss onstage during their set in protest of Malaysia’s anti-LGBTQ laws. Same-sex relationships are illegal in Malaysia, according to the LGBTQ advocacy organization Outright International. The remainder of the festival was canceled after the band’s demonstration. The festival is seeking about $2.4 million, claiming that the band breached its contract resulting in financial loss for the festival’s organizer, Future Sound Asia. Representatives for Future Sound Asia and The 1975 did not respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit, filed in the U.K. High Court on July 23, alleges that the band was aware of the restrictions they needed to follow in order to perform. The organizers allege that the band planned to break the rules ahead of the festival. Restrictions included kissing, swearing, taking off clothes, drinking or smoking onstage and talking about politics or religion, according to the lawsuit.  The lawsuit also alleges that the band had been bound to the same restrictions when performing at the festival in 2016. The agreement from 2016 had stated that “flouting them will result in the event permit being revoked,” according to the lawsuit. During the band’s 2023 set, Healy said that he had made a “mistake” when booking the festival. He then slammed Malaysia’s anti-LGBTQ policies while onstage.  “I do not see the f------ point of inviting The 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with,” he said at the time.  He then kissed MacDonald. Shortly after, the band ended the set early and Healy told the crowd that the band had “just got banned from Kuala Lumpur.”  It was not the first time that Healy had protested a country’s anti-LGBTQ laws during a performance. In 2019, Healy kissed a male fan onstage in Dubai, the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates, where homosexuality is illegal. He said authorities were “going to arrest me” afterward, but the band managed to leave the country after the show, according to an interview with Healy from The Times of London. After the Good Vibes Festival incident, Malaysia’s minister of communications, Fahmi Fadzil, criticized The 1975 on X and called their actions “very rude.”  “There is no compromise against any party that challenges, disparages and violates Malaysian laws,” he posted. Fadzil subsequently announced the cancellation of the remainder of the 2023 festival after meeting with representatives of Future Sound Asia.

Baby Reindeer’ creator Richard Gadd backs Netflix in Fiona Harvey’s defamation lawsuit,"'Baby Reindeer' creator Richard Gadd backs Netflix in Fiona Harvey's defamation lawsuit          Comedian Richard Gadd, the creator of the hit show “Baby Reindeer,” responding to a defamation lawsuit against Netflix, said in a court filing Monday that his characters on the Emmy-nominated series were not representations of real people. The seven-episode series follows Donny (whom Gadd plays as a fictionalized version of himself) as he navigates being stalked by an older woman named Martha (played by Jessica Gunning). Though Gadd said the story is based on his true personal experiences, he has emphasized in previous interviews that the character Martha is not meant to resemble her real-life counterpart. Fiona Harvey, who claims she was the inspiration for the Martha character, sued Netflix last month for more than $170 million, alleging defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Netflix is seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed. It filed several declarations of support, including one from Gadd. Harvey’s lawsuit cites the show’s title card, which reads, “This is a true story,” a line that her attorneys described as the “biggest lie in television history.” The text in the closing credits of the series reads: “This program is based on real events: however certain characters, names, incidents, locations, and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.” In his 21-page declaration, Gadd wrote that the show is “emotionally true” to his own life but that it is not meant to be “a beat-for-beat recounting” of events.  Martha and Donny, Gadd wrote, were intentionally portrayed with fictionalized names, dialogue and scenes, as well as some “imagined personality traits” used as dramatic devices. He emphasized that he never intended the show to enable viewers to identify anyone, including Harvey, as Martha. “I did not write the series as a representation of actual facts about any real person, including Fiona Harvey,” he wrote. “Harvey is never mentioned in the series.” Netflix declined to comment further. Representatives for Gadd and an attorney for Harvey did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Gadd is not named as a defendant in Harvey’s suit. However, he said he if called as a witness, he would testify. Soon after “Baby Reindeer” debuted in April, fans were quick to begin speculating about who the real-life inspiration for Martha could be. That led Gadd to issue a statement on his Instagram story discouraging the behavior, but many sleuths had already landed on Harvey — circulating her name and presumed social media accounts in internet forums. In May, Harvey revealed herself to the public in an interview with British broadcaster Piers Morgan, in which she said she was “forced” to come forward about her experience after fans of the show began harassing her online. In his declaration this week, Gadd also recounted his real-life experiences with Harvey — alleging that she ""stalked and harassed"" him  from 2014 to 2017 after the two first met in 2014. According to the declaration, Harvey was looking distressed at The Hawley Arms, the pub where Gadd worked at the time, and they struck up a conversation after Gadd offered her a free cup of tea. After that encounter, he claimed in the declaration, she began visiting him frequently during his shifts, during which she would make jokes, including “smutty innuendos,” while engaging with the customers and staff members around him. He alleged that Harvey would often try to touch him in inappropriate, and sometimes sexual, ways. “The attention was unwelcome and I found myself constantly trying to dodge Harvey’s advances and unwanted physical contact while serving tables,” Gadd wrote. “I did ask Harvey to leave me alone and to refrain from making advances towards me on several occasions; however, she ignored my requests and, as with her wider behaviour, she was persistent and relentless.” The situation escalated in 2015, Gadd alleged, as Harvey displayed increasingly hostile behavior, including once when she shoved him in the back of his neck after he made a retort that caused her to briefly leave the pub. “Harvey sent me thousands of emails, hundreds of voicemails, and a number of handwritten letters,” he said, attaching several examples to the declaration. “These communications often included sexually explicit, violent, and derogatory content, hateful speech, and threats.” Eventually, he said, he obtained a First Instance Harassment Warning against Harvey, which he said ended the emails and voicemails but did not stop her behavior entirely.  Netflix submitted an additional declaration in which Craig Seymour, former general manager of The Hawley Arms, claimed he witnessed Harvey’s “stalking and harassment” of Gadd firsthand. The company also filed a declaration from Laura Wray, the widow of Jimmy Wray, a member of Parliament, alleging that Harvey “launched a five-year harassment campaign” against her and her husband after Wray terminated Harvey’s employment as a trainee at her law firm, L & L Lawrence Solicitors. She claimed she contacted Scotland police about what she alleged was Harvey’s stalking on several occasions from 1997 to 2002 but that they took no action.

Robert Downey Jr.'s shocking return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Doctor Doom divides fans,"Robert Downey Jr. Opens Up About His Shocking MCU Return: We Want to ""Get Victor von Doom Right""        “New mask, same task,” Robert Downey Jr announced at San Diego Comic-Con when he was introduced as the MCU's Doctor Doom along with returning directors Joe and Anthony Russo for Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. Fans for long have predicted the actor’s return to the MCU — however, no one could have predicted his return as a major multiverse villain after his iconic portrayal of Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Nonetheless, the casting has divided the fans. Some are hyperexcited for Downey’s return while others are disappointed to see another Marvel character's Romani heritage erased. While the actor and the studio have been tight-lipped following the casting news, in a new conversation with The Hollywood Reporters’ Award Chatter podcast, Downey finally opened up about returning to the MCU. The idea was discussed ""Probably a year ago because [Kevin] Feige and I have kept in touch,"" Downey revealed. Adding ""We're pals. [Jon] Favreau, Feige, and I have kept in touch. I'm close with the Russo brothers. We have other business we're doing. So there's this little group of fellow travelers, and I had this instinct that I wanted to go to Bob Iger.” Downey then revealed that he had an idea to join forces with Disney, “outside of the cinematic universe, for how I could be of service to what's going on in the parks and all their location-based energy.” Downey then explained that one day Feige finally found a way to bring him back to the MCU. He explained: “Susan and I were sitting down with Feige at one point, and he said, 'It just keeps occurring to me that, if you were to come back...' And Susan was like, 'Wait, wait, come back as what?'” Feige and Downey’s friendship goes back to Iron Man, the first MCU movie. And when the Infinity Saga ended, Feige famously declared that Tony Stark’s legacy wouldn't be touched, ever. On the podcast, Downey reveals that Feige carefully thought it out before suggesting he return. Per Downey, Feige is “a very sophisticated, creative thinker about, 'How can we not go backwards? How can we not disappoint expectations? How can we continue to beat expectations?'” He went on to say: And he brought up Victor von Doom, and I looked into this character, and I was like, 'Wow.' And later on, he goes, 'Let's get Victor von Doom right. Let's get that right.' So then I said to Kevin, 'Can I go talk to Bob Iger?' He goes, 'About?' I go, 'About everything.'"" After hearing Downey's pitch, Iger invited him and Feige to the Imagineering campus, and what they saw there really impressed them, “I can't say too much about it, but what is going on there right now is so beyond my expectation of what was possible, no wonder it was numinous to me.” The visit gave the Iron Man actor the feeling that ""I can give a certain entertainment-seeking audience, something that they may have a hankering to have an experience of, in a way where I can continue to develop my interest in the future of entertainment. Where the hell else should you go but there?"" Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars are set to release in 2026 and 2027, respectively. Downey's previous MCU projects are available on Disney+.

"Céline Dion, Lady Gaga perform during the Olympic opening ceremony","Céline Dion, Lady Gaga perform during the Olympic opening ceremony          Céline Dion closed out the opening ceremony with her first performance since she announced her diagnosis with stiff-person syndrome in 2022. Dion performed “L’Hymne à l’amour” by the French singer Édith Piaf, from the Eiffel Tower. Lady Gaga kicked off the Olympics opening ceremony performances with a rendition of Zizi Jeanmaire's ""Mon Truc En Plumes"" on a set of stairs along the Seine River. Surrounded by pink feathers, Gaga's brief set was reminiscent of her Jazz and Piano residency in Las Vegas. It also appeared to pay tribute to Jeanmaire's performance of the song on the Ed Sullivan Show. After descending the stairs, Gaga kicked on a chorus line and played on a piano. The opening ceremony is among the most ambitious to date. Headed by artistic director Thomas Jolly, the event runs along the Seine River. Olympics officials largely kept the performers under wraps ahead of the ceremony. In an Instagram post, Gaga expressed gratitude for the opportunity and celebrated Jeanmaire. She also shared her love for France and the country's culture. ""Although I am not a French artist, I have always felt a very special connection with French people and singing French music—I wanted nothing more than to create a performance that would warm the heart of France, celebrate French art and music, and on such a momentous occasion remind everyone of one of the most magical cities on earth—Paris,"" she wrote in her caption. French-Malian pop star Aya Nakamura, one of the most popular contemporary French artists, also performed Friday. Dion and Gaga sparked a social media frenzy after they were spotted in Paris this week. Dion has been open about how stiff-person syndrome has affected her ability to control her vocal cords and sing. The neurological disorder causes rigidity in the torso and limbs and can induce severe muscle spasms. She released a documentary in June called “I Am: Céline Dion” that shows her experiencing a debilitating muscle spasm.

MrBeast collaborator Ava Kris Tyson leaves YouTube channel after accusations of grooming,"MrBeast collaborator Ava Kris Tyson leaves YouTube channel after online users accuse her of grooming          Ava Kris Tyson, a longtime friend and collaborator of YouTube star Jimmy Donaldson (better known as MrBeast), announced this week that she is leaving the channel after online commentators accused her of “grooming.”  Tyson regularly appeared on the MrBeast channel, which features outrageous challenges, elaborate giveaways and high-spending comparison videos. Donaldson has 305 million YouTube subscribers, making his channel the most subscribed-to on the platform. Tyson, who is a transgender woman, has been subjected to attacks against her identity in the past, and Donaldson has defended her. Recently, Tyson was criticized for developing a relationship with a minor online beginning when the person was 13 and Tyson was 20. The controversy began after a video in June analyzing online interactions between Tyson and the minor, who goes by LavaGS online, gained traction on YouTube this week.  More online commentators began scrutinizing public posts between Tyson and LavaGS on X and Discord, including some referring to nude photos, sex and hentai, meaning anime pornography. NBC News was unable to independently verify the posts, which appeared to have been taken down as of Wednesday afternoon.  Social media users appeared to believe the posts were evidence of “grooming,” which the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children defines as building “a relationship, trust and emotional connection with a child or young person so they can manipulate, exploit and abuse them.” Conservatives have weaponized the word “groomer” against the LGBTQ community online in recent years.  In a post on X announcing her departure, Tyson denied the grooming allegations but apologized to her followers.  “I would like to apologize for any of my past behavior or comments if it hurt or offended anyone. It was not my intent,” she wrote Tuesday. “Seeing recent events we’ve mutually decided it’s best I permanently step away from all things MrBeast and social media to focus on my family and mental health.” LavaGS, now 20, rebutted the grooming claims Monday on X.  “These videos are massive lies and twisting the truth,” he said. “Ava never did anything wrong and just made a few edgy jokes. I was never exploited or taken advantage of.” He added that “Kris’s messages to me were sent in public discord servers/groups but everyone is framing it as if it was 1 on 1.”  A representative for Tyson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. LavaGS also did not immediately respond to a request for comment via X.  Tyson posted an apology on X for making “unacceptable social media posts” but directed people to LavaGS’ posts denying claims of grooming.  “To lump these two factors together to create a narrative that my behavior extended beyond bad edgy jokes is disgusting and did not happen,” she posted on X. “In past years, I have learned that my old humor is not acceptable. I cannot change who I was, but I can continue to work on myself.” Despite the posts from Tyson and LavaGS, many online believed the sexual references in Tyson’s interactions with a minor should not be passed off as “edgy.” Some said it is inappropriate for adult content creators to engage in explicit conversations with their minor fans because there is a power imbalance. Amid the criticism against her inappropriate posts, Tyson has received comments misgendering her, as well as anti-LGBTQ harassment. LavaGS has received comments doubting his account of his experience and accusing him of having been “paid off.” Donaldson said in a post Wednesday night on X that he removed Tyson from the company, channel ""and any association with MrBeast"" after becoming aware of the allegations. “Over the last few days, I’ve become aware of the serious allegations of Ava Tyson’s behavior online and I am disgusted and opposed to such unacceptable acts,” he wrote. “During that time, I have been focused on hiring an independent third party to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure I have all the facts."" Donaldson said he will await the investigation’s findings before taking further action. Daysia Tolentino is a culture and internet reporter for NBC News. © 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL",True,True,True

Kendrick Lamar drops 'Not Like Us' music video amid Drake feud,"Kendrick Lamar drops 'Not Like Us' music video amid Drake feud          Kendrick Lamar put a cap on his monthslong feud with Drake by releasing a music video for his hit song ""Not Like Us,"" which dissed the Canadian rapper. Lamar released the video on Independence Day. He previously held a concert called ""The Pop Out"" on Juneteenth, where he performed ""Not Like Us"" six times. Many fans viewed the timing of these events as digs toward Drake, whom Lamar accuses of stealing Black American culture in his diss tracks. The ""Not Like Us"" music video had received over 13 million views as of Friday morning. Many fans online praised the video and viewed it as a celebration of Compton, California, where Lamar is from, and the West Coast. Others delighted in Lamar's continued jabs at Drake. The video appears to make several references to Drake, including the inclusion of an owl piñata and a live owl in a cage. The owl is a mascot for Drake's label October's Very Own, or OVO. While Lamar was hitting the piñata, the music video flashed the disclaimer: ""No Ovhoes were harmed during the making of this video."" There are also references to Toronto, where Drake is from, in the video. Mustard, the producer who made the ""Not Like Us"" beat, is featured in the music video wearing a Toronto Blue Jays hat. NBA player DeMar DeRozan, who is from Compton but previously played on the Toronto Raptors, also makes a cameo in the video. Lamar gave DeRozan a shout out in ""Not Like Us"" while dissing Toronto through the line: ""I’m glad DeRoz’ came home/Y’all didn’t deserve him neither."" Lamar also seemingly made fun of some of the claims set forth in Drake's diss tracks against him. He is seen doing pushups on cinder blocks in the video, which people interpreted as a reference to Drake's diss against Lamar, ""Push Ups."" Lamar also featured his fiancée, Whitney Alford, and kids, who Drake claimed were estranged from Lamar. The two rappers have been embroiled in a rap beef since earlier this year. While many fans stuck by their favorite artists, it is broadly believed that Lamar won the battle because of how popular and pervasive ""Not Like Us"" has become. Some said that ""The Pop Out"" concert on Juneteenth was Lamar's ""victory lap"" in his lyrical fight with Drake. Lamar also teased an unreleased track at the beginning of the ""Not Like Us"" video, which fans speculated hinted at a new project from the rapper.

Aerosmith is exiting the stage. Band members announced Friday that the group is ending its Peace Out: The Farewell Tour early, and will no longer tour at all. Frontman Steven Tyler, 76, who's known for his high-pitched voice, can no longer sing like he used to, due to medical issues. ""We've always wanted to blow your mind when performing,"" the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers wrote in the statement below. ""As you know, Steven's voice is an instrument like no other. He has spent months tirelessly working on getting his voice to where it was before his injury. We've seen him struggling despite having the best medical team by his side. Sadly, it is clear, that a full recovery from his vocal injury is not possible. We have made a heartbreaking and difficult, but necessary, decision — as a band of brothers — to retire from the touring stage."" The band, which has cranked out hit after hit since dropping their debut album in 1973, is known for songs such as ""Sweet Emotion,"" ""Walk This Way,"" ""Love in an Elevator,"" ""Cryin,'"" and ""I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing."" After kicking off the tour in 2023, they played only a handful of times before having to postpone shows in September 2023. Aerosmith noted that Tyler had injured his vocal cords at a concert in New York, adding later that month that the injury was worse than first thought, and they would be off the road longer than expected.

In March, a Los Angeles court granted Tyler's request to strike parts of one suit against him, which alleges both sexual assault and battery, according to PEOPLE.

Justin Simien mourns Lando spinoff series shelving: 'I am in grief',"Justin Simien mourns Lando spinoff series shelving: 'I am in grief'  ""I’ve never lost a child, but it’s what I imagine that pain might be like,"" the director said. Justin Simien is getting real about last year's Lando debacle. Three years after first being announced but with nothing to show for it, concerning news broke that the Simien-helmed, Donald Glover-starring Solo: A Star Wars Story spinoff series would instead be a movie. Since then, again, nothing. The radio silence resumed until Friday, when Collider published remarks from Simien indicating that Lando will not be moving forward. JONATHAN OLLEY /LUCASFILM LTD. Simien is on the road promoting Hollywood Black, an MGM+ docuseries based on the trailblazing book by scholar Donald Bogle examining race and representation in Hollywood. In an interview with Collider's Christina Radish, Simien vented his feelings over the saga of the stalled series. ""It was pretty developed,"" he shared. ""There was a Bible, there was concept art, there were scripts, but it just wasn’t meant to be."" Ever since the Star Wars cinematic universe expanded to the small screen, there have been so many shelved, canceled, and abandoned projects that critics write listicles and fans fill up Reddit threads discussing which they would have most enjoyed seeing. Simien is a part of a vast network of crestfallen creators, but the camaraderie hasn't soothed the sting. ""For me, it has to be done pretty straight on. Like, ‘I am in grief. I do not feel good.’ I have to let myself feel those feelings,"" he said. ""There’s so much that I experience that I get to keep forever and take into the next project. I can’t obviously take the storyline or the IP or the characters, but there’s so much more that I got, as a maker, and that’s mine. Sorry, it’s too late, you can’t take that part back."" Lando was first announced back in 2020 during a Disney investors' call. In a Star Wars era increasingly defined by backstory spinoffs, the move made perfect sense. Glover's Lando was the breakout star of Solo, and Simien was a rising star with three seasons of Dear White People, the series he created, directed, and wrote for Netflix, under his belt. Fans grew even more excited about the series when it was announced that Glover and his brother Stephen, the showrunner on Atlanta and a producer of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, would step in as co-writers. Exactly why Lando fell through the cracks at Disney+ is still unclear.

"The first Emily Henry adaptation, People We Meet on Vacation, finds its leads","The first Emily Henry adaptation, People We Meet on Vacation, finds its leads  The stars of ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" and ""My Lady Jane"" will play the film's romantic duo.  Emily Henry fans, it's time to meet Poppy and Alex. On Friday, Netflix shared a video officially announcing the two romantic leads who will star in the film adaptation of the romance novelist's People We Meet on Vacation. Tom Blyth, who starred as a young Coriolanus Snow in last year's The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Snakes & Songbirds, will portray tender-hearted, homebody Alex, while Emily Bader, recently stealing hearts as the title character in Prime Video's My Lady Jane, will play the more cosmopolitan Poppy. The novel follows the two former longtime best friends, who used to spend one week of every summer on vacation together. Two years ago, something happened and they haven't spoken since. But when Poppy convinces Alex to take one last trip together (to Palm Springs, CA), she's determined to set things right, even if it means putting all their cards on the table once and for all. People We Meet on Vacation will be the first of Henry's bestselling rom-coms to make its way to the screen, though all of her novels since 2020's Beach Read have been optioned. Beach Read, Book Lovers, and Funny Story are currently in development as films, while Jennifer Lopez is attached to produce a TV series adaptation of Happy Place. JOHN NACION/VARIETY VIA GETTY  Henry joined a virtual call with Blyth, Bader, and director Brett Haley (Hearts Beat Loud) to welcome the cast to the project. After Haley and Blyth surprised Bader with the offer to portray Poppy, Henry signed on. ""I'm so excited, you guys,"" Henry told them. ""I have been like kind of an anxious wreck about who would play these characters, and I just truly could not feel any more confident that my readers and then so many more people who don't even know about the book are going to completely, completely fall in love with Poppy and Alex, with you guys playing them.""

Megalopolis extra allegedly kissed by Francis Ford Coppola in set video speaks out: 'I was in shock',"Megalopolis extra allegedly kissed by Francis Ford Coppola in set video speaks out: 'I was in shock'  ""I was caught off guard. And I can tell you he came around a couple times.""  A second Megalopolis extra is speaking out about Francis Ford Coppola’s behavior on set. Lauren Pagone, who appeared as an extra in several scenes in the director's upcoming film, reportedly told Variety that she was kissed and hugged by Coppola while they were in the process of actively shooting a nightclub sequence for the sci-fi drama.  “I was in shock. I didn’t expect him to kiss and hug me like that,” the outlet quoted her as saying. “I was caught off guard. And I can tell you he came around a couple times.” Representatives for Pagone and Coppola did not immediately respond to Entertainment Weekly’s request for comment.  KRISTY SPAROW/GETTY Coppola was first accused of inappropriate behavior on set in a Guardian report back in May, which featured multiple unnamed sources who claimed the filmmaker ""tried to kiss some of the topless and scantily clad female extras” while shooting a nightclub scene. Last week, Variety published two videos taken by a cast member that appeared to show Coppola mingling with extras on set during a party scene including Pagone, who the outlet reported can be seen in one of the videos with her back toward the director before he allegedly hugs and kisses her. In the aftermath of Variety’s initial report, Rayna Menz — another Megalopolis extra who has also claimed to be featured in one of the two videos published by the outlet — told Deadline that Coppola “did nothing to make me or for that matter anyone on set feel uncomfortable.” Pagone told Variety that she chose to break her silence about the incident after Menz’s remarks, noting that she was unhappy that the fellow extra had decided to speak for the film’s entire cast and crew.  “I don’t appreciate anybody speaking for me. I would never speak for that actress,” she reportedly explained. “I’ve kept my mouth shut. I’ve kept quiet. But it’s frustrating that she’s putting out there, ‘Hey, it was great for everyone’ when she doesn’t know what other people were feeling. You can’t speak for anyone but yourself. My experience was different.” Megalopolis has been a 40-year-long passion project for Coppola, who self-financed its $120 million budget. Set in a reimagined version of the U.S., the film stars Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina, an ingenious architect who clashes with the evil Mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito) over how to best rebuild the metropolitan city of New Rome following a major disaster.

Bachelor alum Hailey Merkt dies at 31 after battle with leukemia,"‘The Bachelor’ Alum Hailey Merkt Dies at 31    The model's cancer returned and spread merely six weeks after she received the news of being leukemia-free in April. BY TATIANA TENREYRO Hailey Merkt, who vied for Nick Viall’s heart during season 21 of The Bachelor, has died from leukemia. She was 31. Merkt’s family confirmed her death with a statement shared on the model’s personal Instagram page on Tuesday. “It is with broken hearts we share that our beloved Hailey has passed away after a courageous fight for her life,” it read. “Hailey faced this journey with unimaginable strength, grace and selflessness. Her determination, courage and will to live surpassed every timeline the doctors gave her, and she chose to spend her final moments surrounded by loved ones and doing what she cherished most with no regrets.”  The former reality TV star was remembered as “anything but boring, always hysterically funny and as someone who lived fully in the present moment. Hailey embraced life with an unmatched zest; her beautiful spirit has touched countless lives.” At the end of the post, it was noted that the GoFundMe set up to help Merkt with the costs of her cancer treatment will be kept open “for anyone wishing to offer support in lieu of flowers until August 10 2024 at 12:01 a.m.” The GoFundMe page now states that 100 percent of funds raised will be donated to Merkt’s mother, Michele, used to “afford remaining costs that have overwhelmed Hailey’s mother and family.” The Bachelor alum had chronicled her cancer diagnosis on Instagram, giving followers glimpses at her treatment and life at home. Back in April, Merkt announced on the GoFundMe that she was “leukemia free” after undergoing an experimental stem cell transplant treatment. However, as the fundraiser organizer Christopher Bennett wrote, Merkt received the news six weeks later that her leukemia cells had returned and were “moving fast.” “Her first reaction was to say, ‘I don’t care about myself anymore, but I can’t bear being the cause of so much pain for the people I love,'” Bennett recalled. He added that his late friend wanted to “live every last minute she had to the fullest: being with the people she loved and doing the things she loved, and she loved doing so many simple things. A drink on a patio. Being in the sun. Her family and friends. Her dog, Snuggles. Swimming. An organized cupboard. A checklist of tasks all ticked off. Hanging out in a favorite park. Looking beautiful, with all the creativity that entails. Being beautiful. A beautiful soul.”  During the Thursday episode of his podcast The Viall Files, Viall paid tribute to Merkt. “Hailey was on my season of The Bachelor. She left week 2. I didn’t really get to know her very well at all, but I very much vividly remember her, and I remember her to be very sweet and kind,” he shared.  “She struggled with a very tough battle of leukemia it sounds like, and recently passed away, so our love and hearts go out to her family, who are obviously going through it,” the former Bachelor continued. “It sounds like she really put up a very courageous fight, and, unfortunately, she is with us no more. But very sad to see that she passed, and we’re definitely praying for her and her family.”  Aug. 1, 11:38 a.m.: This story has been updated with Nick Viall’s comments about Merkt’s death.

Whenever Lone Star's conclusion does come, Lowe said it holds more symbolic significance than is usual for the end of a show. ""It feels like it's probably the end of an era of a certain type — well, it doesn’t feel like it,"" he said. ""It is the end of an era of a certain type of show we once had an opportunity to make, and I think they’re great.

And in terms of playing time, I think that they did a really good job,"" Lowe said. ""I don't think there is another show on television with as diverse a cast as we had, telling the kind of diverse stories that we did.

"J.K. Rowling, Elon Musk Criticize Olympics After Algeria’s Imane Khelif Wins Women’s Boxing Match Amid Gender Controversy: ‘A Misogynist Sporting Establishment’","J.K. Rowling, Elon Musk Criticize Olympics After Algeria’s Imane Khelif Wins Women’s Boxing Match Amid Gender Controversy: ‘A Misogynist Sporting Establishment’   By Zack Sharf  J.K. Rowling and Elon Musk are among the high-profile names condemning the Olympics for allowing Algeria’s Imane Khelif to compete in the women’s boxing competition at the Paris 2024 games. Khelif was disqualified from last year’s Women’s World Championships after she failed a gender eligibility test due to elevated levels of testosterone in her system. At the Paris Olympics, Khelif’s boxing match against Italy’s Angela Carini ended in 46 seconds after Carini decided to bow out of the fight after taking some punches from Khelif. Carini fought back tears as she ended the match and later told the BBC: “It could have been the match of a lifetime, but I had to preserve my life as well in that moment.”  “Could any picture sum up our new men’s rights movement better?” Rowling wrote on X while sharing a picture of Carini in tears and Khelif trying to comfort her after the match was cut short. “The smirk of a male who’s knows he’s protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he’s just punched in the head, and whose life’s ambition he’s just shattered.”  Musk shared a post from swimmer Riley Gaines that claimed “men don’t belong in women’s sports.” The X owner co-signed the message by writing: “Absolutely.” The Olympics has stood by its decision to allow Khelif, who was born female, to compete in the women’s boxing competition, saying: “Everyone competing in the women’s category is complying with the competition eligibility rules. They are women in their passports and it is stated that is the case, that they are female.” Carini told press that she would not criticize Khelif’s placement in the women’s competition, saying: “I wish her to carry on until the end and that she can be happy. I am someone who doesn’t judge anyone. I am not here to give judgements.” Khelif’s next boxing match at the Paris Olympics will be against Hungary’s Anna Luca Hamori.

She has never been male or identified as one. These “i can always tell” folk are attacking a woman they rather misogynistically think is male simply because she was born a bit different and is stronger than many other women (yet has been beaten by other women many times).

Extra Kissed by Francis Ford Coppola in ‘Megalopolis’ Set Video Breaks Silence: ‘I Was in Shock’,"Extra Kissed by Francis Ford Coppola in ‘Megalopolis’ Set Video Breaks Silence: ‘I Was in Shock’   An extra on the set of Francis Ford Coppola’s “Megalopolis” has come forward to describe the “shock” she felt after the director kissed her during the filming of a scene. Her comments come a week after Variety published videos of the Oscar-winning filmmaker milling through a crowd while stopping to kiss female background actors. One of the women in the video, Lauren Pagone, who appeared in multiple scenes in “Megalopolis” as an extra, says she was dancing in the middle of a live take of a nightclub sequence when Coppola approached her and pulled her toward him. He then hugged and kissed her.    “I was in shock. I didn’t expect him to kiss and hug me like that. I was caught off guard. And I can tell you he came around a couple times.”    Pagone has worked on several studio projects in recent years including Paramount+’s “Mayor of Kingstown” and Apple TV+’s “City on Fire” and says the situation was unusual. On every other project Pagone had done, an intimacy coordinator was on hand during any scenes in which there was nudity.  Several actresses were cleared to do topless nudity for the nightclub sequence, according to a call sheet reviewed by Variety. Pagone did not appear nude and was outfitted in a top with a plunging neckline.  Pagone decided to come forward when another woman, Rayna Menz, told Deadline that she was one of the actresses seen in one of the two videos published by Variety. Menz told the trade publication that Coppola “did nothing to make me or for that matter anyone on set feel uncomfortable.”   Menz did not respond to an email from Variety requesting additional comment. Pagone was upset that Menz would speak for the entire cast and crew of the film. “I don’t appreciate anybody speaking for me. I would never speak for that actress,” Pagone adds. “I’ve kept my mouth shut. I’ve kept quiet. But it’s frustrating that she’s putting out there, ‘Hey, it was great for everyone’ when she doesn’t know what other people were feeling. You can’t speak for anyone but yourself. My experience was different.”   A spokesperson for Coppola said no one was available for comment on this article.    “Megalopolis” intimacy coordinator Samantha McDonald previously told Variety that neither she nor Ashley Anderson, the film’s other intimacy coordinator, were on set for the nightclub scene, which was filmed on Feb. 14, 2023, at Atlanta’s Tabernacle concert hall. “I can’t really speak to the reason why they chose to bring us in when they did and not when they didn’t,” McDonald said.  In recent days, another member of the cast approached Variety to say that they had witnessed Coppola kissing “multiple women” during a different scene involving a New Year’s Eve celebration. Shortly before filming started, Coppola told the extras that he wanted them to act as they would at a typical holiday party and kiss each other at the end of the countdown, the cast member said. He added that he might jump in and kiss a few people himself. After calling cut, Coppola got up, stopped multiple women as they passed him and kissed them on the cheek. “The women that I saw being kissed did not see him coming. He just basically grabbed them and planted the kiss on them without any kind of consent,” the person added. “They all kind of laughed it off for a moment and then I could tell that they were just surprised.” The crew member who shot the video that Variety initially shared and who was on the set for almost all of the shoot confirmed that Coppola kissed female extras during the filming of the New Year’s Eve sequence and said it was one of several instances in which the director kissed background performers. The cast member who has worked on a number of high-profile productions in and around Atlanta says, “My entire experience being on that set was super weird and uncomfortable. It was probably the worst experience for me on a set ever.” The videos that Variety previously published seemed to corroborate parts of a May report in the Guardian that claimed the 85-year-old director “tried to kiss some of the topless and scantily clad female extras” and told them “he was ‘trying to get them in the mood.’” In one of Variety’s videos, Coppola can be seen moving toward Pagone who turns her back to him. He then pulls her closer to him and appears to hug and kiss her.  Sources said Coppola, a film icon who has directed classics such as “The Godfather” and “The Conversation,” appeared to act with impunity on set. They noted that because Coppola financed the entire $120 million budget himself, there was no place to complain about unorthodox behavior. Movies that are produced by streamers and major studios have more formalized human resources departments where actors and crew members can raise issues and concerns.  The crew member who took the video told Variety that Coppola kept leaping up to hug and kiss several women, often inadvertently inserting himself into the shot and ruining it, which the crew member said was unusual. (Pagone confirmed to Variety that the video she appears in was during a live shot and was not taken during a break.)   The crew member said that after multiple takes, Coppola got on a microphone and announced in earshot of everyone in the room, “Sorry, if I come up to you and kiss you. Just know it’s solely for my pleasure.” Lionsgate is releasing “Megalopolis,” which stars Adam Driver, Aubrey Plaza and Shia LaBeouf, domestically on Sept. 27. 7 Comments Comments are moderated.

Agree 100% There is just no end to the shmuckery. Just stop Variety. You’d think after your sister publication called out your BS you’d stop making a fool of yourselves. Oh for Gods sake! Leave Coppola alone! Eighty-five. Grieving his wife and dealing with old age. I think it would be best to retire. I feel sorry for him and if the kissing was limited to bussing on the cheek, it’s not that traumatic for the extras but it’s definitely time to hang up the director’s hat. It sounds like the beginnings of dementia. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment Variety is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2024 Variety Media, LLC.

Elizabeth Taylor and Faye Dunaway Made Star Power Into an Art,"Elizabeth Taylor and Faye Dunaway Made Star Power Into an Art — These HBO Docs Prove It   By Daniel D'Addario  There’s something that unites the recent documentaries “Faye” and “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes.” It isn’t just that both played on HBO — “Faye” launched in July, while “Elizabeth Taylor” is to premiere August 3 — or that both center the stories of legendary, Oscar-winning performers. Faye is, of course, Faye Dunaway, of “Network” and “Chinatown,” while Elizabeth Taylor, one of the most decadently media-hounded figures of the 20th Century, practically needs no introduction at all.  What the films share, though, is a poignant and sometimes painful double yearning. In the documentaries, Dunaway — still with us at age 83, and interviewed recently for this film — and Taylor — who died in 2011 but whose “lost tapes” catalogue an extensive 1964 debriefing with journalist Richard Meryman —  both express doubt, anxiety and even shame for career missteps, misbegotten projects and the ways in which their private troubles played out in public view. The viewer feels for them, first because they are human, and then because their manner of expressing their emotions is so extravagantly more than human. That’s the other yearning at the heart of these documentaries: a sense that the culture can no longer produce great actresses who are, too, stars who glitter quite this brightly.  Both films, happily, are stuffed full of film clips, and both give a sense of their respective subjects’ styles. In director Laurent Bouzereau’s curation in “Faye,” Dunaway, at her best, uses a bracing sense of control in order to shock the viewer all the more when she snaps in grand fashion. (The famous photograph of her the morning after winning her Oscar — used as the featured image in this column — in which she’s gazing into the middle distance, is a supreme example of her powers: We’re seeing, through exhaustion and exhilaration, a woman in utter control of the image she wants to present.) In interviews with the press, Dunaway, while seeming to hold her feelings back, has a relentless erudition and quickness that makes clear just how much of herself was in “Network’s” brilliant executive, or “Chinatown’s” tricky femme fatale. Her interview for the documentary feels like a sort of letting-go, an unburdening of thoughts she might have withheld from the press to this point. But the clarity of thought remains intact.   Meanwhile, filmmaker Nanette Burstein shows Taylor, for all the outsizedness of her fame, carrying herself on screen with a funny self-deprecation, a shrewdness that feels decades ahead of her time. We’re told that Taylor was 32 when she played the fiftysomething Martha in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” and while her physical transformation for the role is indeed impressive, it’s the changes to her soul and bearing — her willingness to flaunt her signs of age in a sort of ironic self-deprecation — that feels most remarkable. And both actors are startingly open about career and personal setbacks they faced, including the public’s coming to pigeonhole them. Dunaway speaks about her bipolar diagnosis and her struggles with alcohol, both things that derailed her ability to trust her great gift, her clear and precise thinking. (Both, also, led to her outsized reputation as a difficult colleague — her composure giving way to a great break isn’t just something that happened for Dunaway onscreen.) And we also get an unpacking of why “Mommie Dearest” — the infamous bomb that toppled her career — was such a severe disappointment. Dunaway believed she was really finding something sharp and true in her depiction of Joan Crawford as an abusive mother, and lost herself in the role so deeply that she couldn’t find her way, in the absence of a surer directorial hand, to coherence. Others who speak in “Faye,” including her son, are better-situated than is Dunaway to judge why it is that she takes a particular project’s failure so hard. Publicity-shy even despite her doing a sweeping interview toward the end of her life, Dunaway poured her personal setbacks and challenges into her work. To reject it, perhaps, is to reject her. Meanwhile, Taylor speaks with sharp frankness about, for instance, her dislike of the film “Butterfield 8” (for which she won her first Oscar, which Taylor credits to sympathy for health struggles she was undergoing) and the dramas of filming “Cleopatra,” which she shot with Richard Burton, one of the loves of her life. Taylor and Burton — two stars of exaggerated appetites, talents and passions — strode atop the world. But their notoriety came with its own frustrations for someone who’d wanted, first, to tell stories: “It’s a losing game!,” Taylor tells Meryman. “People already have a set image. They want to believe either the good or the bad. And if you try and explain, then you lose yourself along the way.”  And we see Taylor’s performance of herself as someone increasingly willing to display her frustration with the press. Asked, at a joint press conference with Burton, about her relationship with ex-husband Eddie Fisher, Taylor snaps “Do you read the papers, love? I suggest you do,” then rolls her eyes and tosses her head back. Later, she tells a journalist from “60 Minutes” that “fighting is one of the greatest exercises in marital togetherness”; when the journalist asks if Burton dominates her in their marriage, she widens those famous eyes and blurts “You must be joking!” That it seems almost like an impulse, rather than the ongoing press approach of someone eager to communicate her weariness with the press’ rapaciousness, is a sign of just how gifted an actress Taylor was.  “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes” constructs, methodically, a case for Taylor as a genius both of performing onscreen and at performing for a sort of media that no longer exists. Both Dunaway, an actress who made a point of revealing as little as possible, and Taylor, one who was willing to give it all away — but with a wink that made the consumer aware that she saw herself being consumed — existed in a media climate both rougher and more predictable than today’s.  That media climate was cruel and heartbreaking to those who became its subjects; it also made legends. No one, likely, would trade today’s way of writing about actresses, for all its flaws, for the way Dunaway and Taylor were written about. And yet other aspects of the culture were better-situated to create legends. Dunaway, reflecting, begins to see, in the work she made, an impact on the world; Taylor leveraged her fame not merely for movieland success but for charitable pursuits astounding in their magnitude and timeliness. (In an exceptional clip in the Taylor documentary, Taylor explains why she began fundraising for the fight against AIDS: Few were speaking out or doing anything, and, she says, “it so angered me that I thought, ‘Bitch, do something yourself!’”) We don’t make stars the way we did in Dunaway and Taylor’s era these days. And that’s a good thing. But, for all the ascendant actors who compel in their own ways, watching these women, in two very strong entries in the celebrity-tells-all canon, can convince a viewer, for a moment, that we don’t, anymore, make them at all. “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes” premieres on HBO and Max on Aug. 3; “Faye” is streaming on Max. 0 Comments Comments are moderated.

Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman Crash Comic-Con with All the Cameo Stars from 'Deadpool & Wolverine',"Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman Crash Comic-Con’s Hall H with All the Cameo Stars from ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’   “Deadpool & Wolverine” may have finally been released in theaters, but stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman saved their biggest press tour stop for last. The pair rolled into San Diego Comic-Con, alongside co-star Emma Corrin, director Shawn Levy and Marvel chief Kevin Feige to present the Hall H audience with a surprise screening of the film on the same day that it hits the big screen around the world. Warning: spoiler-talk below. The special event, dubbed “The Ultimate Deadpool & Wolverine Celebration of Life,” came at the end of a particularly busy day for Reynolds, Jackman and Levy, who jetted to San Diego from Los Angeles following Feige’s Walk of Fame Ceremony earlier in the day.  The quitet took the stage one-by-one as if it were a normal Comic-Con panel, with Reynolds reminiscing about his first trip to Comic-Con with the original “Deadpool” movie.  “I was the most nervous human being you would ever see,” Reynolds said. “I was stepping into a dream come true in a certain sense, but I remember making that movie for you, and I remember how gratifying it was that everyone else liked it too.” He continued: “I feel like I was able to connect with you in a way that I’d really kind of been yearning to connect.And I’ll never forget this moment, because this asshole was backstage…” he added, nodding to Jackman, who chimed in to finish the story. “I was standing just over there,” Jackman began. “I watched the footage and there was this chant that started up: ‘One more time, one more time.’ I ran backstage and I found that the stage manager, and I said, ‘Play the footage again. If you don’t play the fucking footage again, they are going to tear Hall H to the ground.'” Then, after conjuring up those happy memories, Reynolds cued up a clip of co-star Leslie Uggams (in character as Blind Al) saying, “Can we skip the bullshit and just show the damn movie?” The crowd (a full house of 6,500) erupted at the announcement and suddenly the souvenirs they’d been awarded for lining up outside Hall H — those highly-coveted (and hilariously sexual) Wolverine-head popcorn buckets — made even more sense. As the lights went down in the auditorium-turned- makeshift movie theater, ushers passed around popcorn and Reynolds, Jackman, Feige and co. settled into the folding chairs in the audience.  Throughout the 2-hour runtime, the crowd reacted raucously to all the major moments, but especially the Easter eggs and in-jokes. However, nothing played more electrically than the movie’s surprise cameos. With each reveal, the audience erupted into cheers which painted a huge grin on Feige’s face as he took it all in. After the credits rolled, the cast returned. Reynolds, who seemed visibly moved by the experience, said it was an “emotional honor and a privilege to be standing up here next to the X-Man (Jackman).” Jackman called watching this film with all of Hall H one of the most incredible experiences of his life. “It’s been 24 years since I first played Wolverine,” he said, profusely thanking Levy and Reynolds for creating the conditions to do it again. But the duo didn’t want to celebrate alone and invited the entire spoiler-rific cameo cast on stage, including Dafne Keen, Jennifer Garner, Channing Tatum, Wesley Snipes, and Chris Evans (who Reynolds made sure to intro as Human Torch, specifically). The “Deadpool & Wolverine” celebration is the first of two Hall H takeovers from Marvel Studios. Following the screening, the studio staged a 10-minute drone and fireworks show over Petco Park, with formations of Deadpool and Wolverine, as well as a tease of what’s to come when Feige take the stage again on Saturday. (If you read between the flashing lights, expect major updates on “The Fantastic Four.”) But for now, Marvel’s focus is on “Deadpool & Wolverine” — which also stars Morena Baccarin, Rob Delaney, Leslie Uggams, Karan Soni and Matthew Macfadyen. Early projections show the superhero threequel breaking records at the box office, earning between $160 million to $170 million from 4,200 North American theaters, and topping 2016’s “Deadpool” (which opened to $132 million) as the new titleholder. However, buzz around the film (especially talk of surprise cameos) could propel the three-day tally to $190 to $200 million. (Disney spent about $200 million to produce and roughly another $100 million to promote the movie.) Feige, Reynolds, Levy and Lauren Shuler Donner produced the film with Louis D’Esposito, Wendy Jacobson, George Dewey, Mary McLaglen, Josh McLaglen, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Simon Kinberg serving as executive producers. “Deadpool & Wolverine” is written by Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Zeb Wells and Levy. 1 Comment Comments are moderated.

Aman Wadhwa Updated : Aug 03, 2024, 07:07 PM IST   Edited by : Aman Wadhwa The two-part epic action films Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion follows the war of succession between Amarendra Baahubali and his older cousin brother Bhallaladeva. As Amarendra Baahubali dies in the climax of the first part, his son Mahendra Baahubali goes back to Mahishmati to avenge his father's death and reclaim his throne. Prabhas played the father and the son in a double role and Rana Daggubati played the antagonist Bhallaladeva in the films directed by SS Rajamouli. Modern Masters: SS Rajamouli is the latest Netflix documentary showcasing how SS Rajamouli has become one of the greatest filmmakers in the world.

The playful moment sparked a brief but humorous exchange between Bachchan and Dhankhar. Bachchan jested, ""Did you get a lunch break today? No? This is why you're taking Jairam Ji's name repeatedly.

This light-hearted exchange comes in the wake of Bachchan's earlier objection to being addressed as ""Jaya Amitabh Bachchan"" by Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh. On July 29, Bachchan firmly stated, ""Sir, only Jaya Bachchan would have sufficed,"" highlighting her concern about women being identified solely by their husband's names. During that session, Bachchan expressed her discontent, stating, ""This is something new, that women will be recognized by the name of their husbands like they have no existence or achievements of their own."" Jaya Bachchan, who has been an influential figure in both cinema and politics, married megastar Amitabh Bachchan on June 3, 1973. The couple has two children, Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan. The couple has acted in several films together, including Zanjeer, Sholay, Abhimaan, Mili, Chupke Chupke, Silsila, and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.

Moonrise Time Today: City-wise moonrise timings for Kajari Teej, Sankashti Chaturthi Puja  ENTERTAINMENT Ram Gopal Varma bashes Indian filmmakers for undermining the audiences' intelligence. Riya Sharma Updated : Aug 03, 2024, 02:11 PM IST   Edited by : Riya Sharma Ram Gopal Varma, the filmmaker, who is best known for his films like Satya, Shiva, Company, Rangeela, Sarkar, and more, recently slammed Indian filmmakers for thinking the audience as 'dumb' and having an approach for making a star-driven film.  In an interview with Galatta Plus, Ram Gopal Varma talked about how in the West, filmmakers are making movies even in their old age and advance with technology and said, ""When you talk about Scorsese, or when you talk about Clint Eastwood, the kind of realism and effectiveness… They’re taking up (interesting) subjects, and getting performances that are top-notch. More than anything else, it is their personal attitude which is reflected in their films.” He further added, ""First of all, we don’t make such films. We think of the audience as dumb. Basically, the kind of cinema they make, and the benchmark there… Imagine what is the benchmark here. All the big (Hollywood) stars come together and make Oppenheimer. And here, all the big stars come together and they make Thugs of Hindostan.” The filmmaker also highlighted the balanced approach of stars like Aamir Khan, who manage both big-budget and smaller films effectively. “Aamir can juggle a film like Ghajini with Taare Zameen Par because he understands his audience and keeps the costs in check. He knows that a blockbuster can reach 100 people while a niche film might reach only 20, but he adjusts the effort and investment accordingly."" Ram Gopal Varma has backed the projects of many Indian filmmakers who received backlash or criticism for the movie. From The Kashmir Files to Animal, the filmmaker has praised the films and their directors on social media. He was also seen praising the multi-starrer film Kalki 2898 AD starring Prabhas, Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan, and Kamal Haasan. The filmmaker also had a cameo in the movie along with SS Rajamouli, Vijay Deverakonda, and Dulquer Salmaan.  The DNA app is now available for download on the Google Play Store.

'Agar aap uske hisaab se....': Mohammed Shami reveals 'big secret' about Rohit Sharma's captaincy BOLLYWOOD Kriti Sanon's fans have rallied behind her over the recent viral video that appeared to show her smoking Abhimanyu Mathur Updated : Aug 01, 2024, 10:39 PM IST Kriti Sanon is currently in Greece vacationing with friends and family. The actress rang in her 34th birthday in the Mediterranean nation last week. But things soured after a video of hers purportedly smoking there went viral. Many trolls attacked the actress calling her a hypocrite given that she had vehemently stated she is anti-smoking in earlier interviews. Now, a section of the internet has come out in Kriti’s defence, slamming trolls for invading her privacy and filming a private moment. The video appears to show Kriti sitting by the oceanside smoking a cigarette. The video has been shot from far and does not show with clarity what the actress is holding. However, fans said that it need not be a concern even if she is smoking. Reacting to the video, one Twitter user said, “Let her live her life and enjoy her vacation. What is the fuss here I don't know.” A comment on Reddit added that what she does in her private life should not be criticised. “Ehh who cares? As long as she's not promoting it, she can do whatever she wants in her private life,” read the comment.  Many actually slammed the person who shot and posted the video online, arguing that it constitutes an invasion of privacy as the actress was in her private space at the time. One fan asked, “Is it okay to click pics without permission??? She isn't in some media promotion event, it's her private life.” Many supported this argument. One comment read, “Just because they're famous, doesn't mean you're not going to respect their personal space or invade their privacy. They don't owe us that.” Kriti Sanon was last seen on screen in the comedy heist film Crew. Not only was the film a box office success but the actress also  impressed everyone with her performance in. Kriti will be next seen in the movie Do Patti, which is also produced by her. The film marks her second collaboration with Kajol after Dilwale and is currently under production. The DNA app is now available for download on the Google Play Store.

Broadcaster HBO has said that it is aggressively monitoring and removing clips online so that fans can watch the episode in its entirety on Sunday. According to Variety, HBO said an international third-party distributor shared the clips from the fantasy drama ""unintentionally"". ""We are aware that clips from the House of the Dragon season finale have surfaced across social media platforms. The clips were posted after an unintentional release from an international third-party distributor. HBO is aggressively monitoring and removing clips from the internet, and fans can watch the episode in its entirety this Sunday night on HBO and (streamer) Max,"" the network said in a statement. Several scenes from the second season leaked onto TikTok on Tuesday night. One TikTok account posted 14 videos and roughly 30 minutes of footage from the unaired finale. The videos had garnered approximately 50,000 to 100,000 views at the time Variety published its report. Roughly three hours after the clips were posted, the TikTok account was banned, but videos had already made their way to other social media platforms like X and Reddit by then. HBO had tried nipping piracy in the bud by not sending screeners of House of the Dragon season two finale to journalists but to no avail. Previously, the show's season one finale was also leaked online two days before its air date in October 2022. Game of Thrones, the parent series of House of the Dragon, suffered several such leaks in its 8-season run from 2011 to 2019.

Ladakh: 7 dead, 20 injured after bus plunges into gorge in Durbuk   BOLLYWOOD Shah Rukh Khan is reportedly rushing to the US for emergency treatment to his eye after consulting some of India's top experts Abhimanyu Mathur Updated : Jul 31, 2024, 11:54 AM IST Shah Rukh Khan is reportedly flying to the US for medical attention to an eye ailment. While the actor or his team has not commented on this purported illness, the star does seem to be heading overseas after reports claimed of a botched treatment in Mumbai. Now, a new report has claimed that the actor had consulted some of India’s top eye doctors in Hyderabad days before his decision to seek treatment in the US. On Tuesday, Bollywood Hungama had reported that the actor was being rushed to the US for eye treatment after initial treatment in Mumbai went bad. “Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) had gone to a hospital in Mumbai on Monday, July 29 for an eye treatment. The treatment didn’t go as planned. SRK is now being rushed to the USA to rectify the damage,” the portal quoted a source as saying. However, the exact nature of the illness was not revealed. Now, a report in Siasat has claimed that the actor had recently met specialists at Hyderabad’s noted LV Prasad Eye Hospital, considered one of the best eye hospitals in the country. The report states that when the actor was in Hyderabad last month following filmmaker Ramoji Rao’s death, he took out time to meet eye doctors. “His visit to Hyderabad on June 11 which was to offer condolences to the family of Ramoji Rao, also included a visit to the LV Prasad Eye Hospital in Banjara Hills. King Khan was supposed to come back but due to his other plans he didn’t,” a source was quoted as saying. Shah Rukh’s team is yet to comment on the nature of his ailment or even confirm or deny its existence so far. However, LV Prasad Eye Institute has several noted experts in corneal transplants, cataract, and other eye surgeries. Shah Rukh has reportedly had some treatment on his eyes earlier as well. Times Now reported last year that the celebrated actor underwent surgeries for cataract on both of his eyes in 2023. DNA could not independently verify any of these claims. Shah Rukh had a stupendous comeback to the big screen last year after a 5-year absence. He starred in three big hits with Jawan and Pathaan becoming the two-highest-grossing Indian films of the year. The actor is next to be seen in King, which marks his maiden collaboration with daughter Suhana Khan. The DNA app is now available for download on the Google Play Store.

The actor, who recently appeared in the Emraan Hashmi-starrer Showtime, responded to the ban on Pakistani artists. In an interview with Bollywood Bubble, Rajeev expressed his opinion that it is unjust for politicians to advocate a ban on Pakistani actors. (Also read: Rajeev Khandelwal says Sanjay Leela Bhansali made him wait for a film for 1 year) Rajeev, while speaking about ther ban on Pakistani artists, opined, “Nahi nahi, it is politics. Bohot galat hai. Logo ko ban karne waale kaun hote hain politicians. Humari politics dictate karti hai kuchh cheezo ko. Jaha pe pyaar badh sakta hai, uss pyaar ko bhi aap badhne nahi de rahe, for whatever reasons. So, I don't understand this. Mera comment karna bhi galat hoga kyuki mujhe samajh hi nahi aata hai ki kyu. Hum aman ki baat karte hain na. To jaha aman ban raha hai waha bhi political party ke log aa ke usko Hindu-Muslim ka angle de dete hain. Toh wo galat hai. Aisa thodi hai ki Pakistan ki government unhe agent ki tarah bhej rhi hai. Pata nahi. I have seen a lot of love coming (No, it is all politics. This is very wrong. Who are these politicians to ban artists? Our politics dictates a certain narrative. Where there is love blossoming between two nations, you don't even allow that for whatever reasons. So, I don't understand this. I also feel that it's wrong on my part to comment on this as I don't understand it. We often speak about harmony and peace. So, where there is genuine peace and harmony, there too political parties give it a Hindu-Muslim angle. That is not right. It's not that the Pakistani government is sending the artists as agents. I have only seen a lot of love coming).” Rajeev is known for his work in popular Hindi television shows like Kahiin To Hoga and Sacch Ka Saamna. He made his Bollywood debut with Aamir (2008).

"Heeramandi’s Jason Shah says ‘Sanjay Leela Bhansali wasn’t directing much’ on set, confesses he was close to being labelled a ‘problem maker’","Heeramandi actor Jason Shah says ‘Sanjay Leela Bhansali wasn’t directing much’ on set, confesses he was close to being labelled a ‘problem maker’  Actor Jason Shah, who played the villainous British officer Cartwright in the recent Netflix series Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, spoke about the differences in opinion that he had with some of the creative decisions that were made during the shoot. He confessed that series creator and filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali didn’t direct many of his scenes, and said that he would have loved to have had more of a say in how his character was presented in the show. Appearing on the Inside the Mind with Rushabh podcast, Jason revealed that he raised his concerns, but that if he’d registered more complaints, he would have been labelled a ‘problem maker’. Asked why he felt dissatisfied, Jason explained, “It was his first time (doing a web series). Film is a little different because web is a little stretched, you’ve got a lot of episodes to make, and it’s not made in a short time… He also wasn’t directing that much. I had other directors with me. I just felt we could’ve worked on it a little more, and a lot more colour could’ve come out. It had the capacity, I feel.” Also read – Heeramandi’s Jason Shah opens up about differences in opinion with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, says assistants directed most of his scenes Jason said that there was a ‘lack of communication’ on set, as opposed to there being ‘miscommunication’. He said that he could’ve done more with Cartwright had he been given more freedom. “What didn’t happen was the depth of the character. If you look at Gandhi, with Ben Kingsley, they really show how far racism can go, and the dichotomy between who someone thinks they are, and another human being…” Asked if he raised these concerns with Bhansali, Jason replied with a laugh, “I think I said enough. I would’ve become a problem maker if I said more.” Previously, Jason had said that the Heeramandi set lacked ‘the basic niceties of human nature’, as he complained about being kept in the dark about creative decisions, and being made to complete all his scenes at the end of the day, in a limited amount of time. He also revealed that Bhansali’s assistants directed most of his scenes, and that he would often get conflicting direction from different people. Set in pre-Independence India, Heeramandi revolved around the lives of courtesans and noblemen in Lahore. The show received mixed reviews, with praise for Bhansali’s vision, but criticism for some performances. A second season has been announced.

Ram Gopal Varma giggles as he dissects the failure of Kerala Story follow-up: ‘Everybody ignored it’,"Ram Gopal Varma giggles as he dissects the failure of Kerala Story follow-up: ‘Everybody ignored it’  Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma highlighted how unpredictable the business of making films is, by citing the example of the controversial blockbuster The Kerala Story, and its follow-up, The Bastar Story, which was completely ‘ignored’ by audiences. RGV said that his biggest hits have been unplanned, while the movies that he has tried to manufacture into hits have flopped. In an interview, the filmmaker said that nobody has the answer for what’ll work and what won’t, but the trick, according to him, is to work quickly and in a cost-effective manner. Chatting with Baradwaj Rangan on Galatta Plus, the filmmaker recalled something that the Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman once told him. He said, “Rahman told me that sometimes, when he’s making a tune, he thinks that it’ll be the blockbuster of the year. But when the song comes out, people ignore it. They don’t even call it bad, they pretend like it doesn’t even exist. There are umpteen examples to prove this. In my own case, all my hit films are accidents, and my flops are intentional.” Also read – Ram Gopal Varma recalls the only disagreement he’s ever had with Amitabh Bachchan: ‘He called me at night and said I was right’ RGV said that The Kerala Story is one of the best films that he has seen in years, but he was shocked to learn that the same team made a follow-up that didn’t work. “I was very, very happy with this film, The Kerala Story. It’s one of the best films I’ve seen in many years. I spoke to the director, I spoke to the producer, I spoke to the actress. Then, I was shocked to know that the next film came, released, and went, and I wasn’t even aware of it.” RGV said that there is no explanation for what happened, as the first film made over Rs 300 crore and generated lots of conversation, but the second film ‘comes and everyone ignores it’. RGV continued with a giggle, “This goes back to the same Rahman theory. You simply don’t know. The only answer is Socrates’ line: ‘the only thing I know is nothing’.” The filmmaker said that Indian directors don’t respect their audience, and present them with ‘proposal films’ designed to serve a star’s ego, over something more meaningful and memorable.  The Kerala Story was widely criticised for promoting propaganda, and Ram Gopal Varma has shared similarly controversial opinions about Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal, calling it one of the boldest films he has seen coming from India.

‘Atheist’ SS Rajamouli reveals he didn’t pray to God even as his wife ‘bled profusely’ after road accident,"‘Atheist’ SS Rajamouli reveals he didn’t pray to God even as his wife ‘bled profusely’ after road accident  Filmmaker SS Rajamouli tells stories with mythological themes, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that he believes in God. The director, known for blockbuster spectacles such as RRR and the Baahubali movies, has revealed that his atheism remained unshaken even in one of the most testing times of his life. In the new Netflix documentary Modern Masters: SS Rajamouli, the filmmaker said that even some of the toughest personal tragedies couldn’t convert him into a believer, as he recalled when his wife, Rama Rajamouli, was injured in a terrible road accident in a remote location. The accident happened while while Rajamoulis was filming for the Ram Charan-starrer Magadheera. The filmmaker said that he “froze” after the accident, and began crying. He attempted to get in touch with every doctor that he knew, while his “wife bled profusely and was paralysed in her lower back from shock.” “The nearest hospital was 60 kms away. I was absolutely terrified. At the back of my mind a thought erupted, ‘Am I praying to God to help me?’ But I didn’t do that. I just frantically cried and kept calling doctors and kept doing what needed to be done. I think, at some point, I chose karma yoga as my way of life. My work is my god. I have huge respect for cinema,” he said in the documentary.

Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt's upcoming film 'The Fall Guy' is being severely criticised for featuring a joke about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's marriage.,"Internet slams 'The Fall Guy' for joke aimed at Johnny Depp-Amber Heard  Listen to Story Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt's upcoming film 'The Fall Guy' is being severely criticised for featuring a joke about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's marriage. A dialogue from the film makes reference to the turbulent relationship of the former couple which has caused the stir. 'The Fall Guy', directed by David Leitch, is all set to hit theatres on Friday, May 3. Ahead of that, the action-comedy has been garnering backlash for the dialogue ""It's like Amber and Johnny were just in here."" For the unversed, the film features a scene where Hannah Waddingham's character refers to Johnny and Amber's 'tumultuous relationship'. The dialogue follows Waddingham's character entering a dishevelled trailer. The dialogue stirred a discourse among the viewers who watched the film at screenings. Fans and followers shared their reactions on social media, and additionally they expressed their dismay. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard accused each other of domestic violence and abuse following their split in 2016.  An X user wrote, ""The Fall Guy made a distasteful joke about the domestic abuse Amber suffered at the hands of Johnny. It is 2024. Why are we writing these kinds of lines in movies? Nasty work (sic)."" Other users questioned the makers about what made the scene humorous. Read some comments here: However, the makers haven't responded to the backlash yet. After getting married in 2015, Johnny and Amber dissolved their marriage just 15 months later. However, their separation was far from smooth, gaining public attention in 2019 when Johnny filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife. In 2018, Amber wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post addressing domestic violence. Although she didn't directly name him in the piece, Johnny contended that it implied references to him. This sparked a legal dispute that involved both actors levying accusations of physical, emotional, and mental abuse against each other in court. Meanwhile, 'The Fall Guy' will release on Friday and also stars Lee Majors, Teresa Palmer and Aaron Taylor Johnson in key roles.",True,True,True

Arjun Rampal says cheating in relationships is an ‘addiction’,"Arjun Rampal says cheating in relationships is an ‘addiction’: ‘Sex is very important but being with one partner is even more important’  Arjun Rampal, who has appeared in films like Rock On and Om Shanti Om, recently spoke about people cheating on their partners and called it an “addiction.” Arjun was asked about casual sex and open relationships and the actor said that even though one does not realise it, there is a “huge energy exchange” when one is in a sexual relationship with another person. He stressed that being with one partner is the most important thing. Talking to Ranveer Allahbadia on his YouTube channel, the actor said, “I love sex (laughs). I think sex is a very important part of your life but yes, I think being with one partner is even more important. When you are sharing a bed, sharing physicality, you don’t realise it there is a huge energy exchange, shift in what you are taking in from that person as well. It is going into your DNA somewhere.” As the interviewer spoke about non-monogamous relationships and people cheating on their partners, Arjun said, “It’s an addiction, it’s a habit that people created for themselves. I know a lot of people who need another woman or whatever and they are in a very happy marriage, they call it happy marriage, I don’t know how, whatever it is, they say it’s just a fling, or nothing, but it’s not just nothing. It’s actually an addiction, it’s actually going to pull you down.” ALSO READ   Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha movie review: Mothballed Ajay Devgn, Tabu film is unworthy of its leads Arjun said that despite the fact that this isn’t good for one’s life, they shouldn’t be hard on themselves. “I was a person who was very hard on myself. I wasted a lot of time just beating myself up.” He said instead of wasting time in thinking about those mistakes, one should make sure that they “don’t repeat those mistakes” and change themselves. Arjun was previously married to Mehr Jesia. They share two daughters. He is now in a relationship with Gabriella Demetriades and they share two sons.

Akshay Kumar says Bollywood folks send him ‘condolence messages’ when his films flop,"Akshay Kumar says Bollywood folks send him ‘condolence messages’ when his films flop: ‘Mara nahi hoon main, will keep on working till they shoot me’   Akshay Kumar had the Midas touch with almost every film he did turning into a Rs 100 crore spinner. He was the actor who delivered the first superhit post-pandemic in Sooryavanshi, bolstering his image. However, the thing with luck in the fickle business that’s Bollywood is that it runs out. The actor followed it up with over half a dozen flops including Bachchhan Paandey, Samrat Prithviraj, Raksha Bandhan, Mission Raniganj, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, Selfiee, and Ram Setu. He most recently starred in the biopic Sarfira, a remake of the Tamil hit Soorarai Pottru, which emerged as one of his biggest flops in years. The saving grace was an extended cameo in the hit film OMG 2, which he also produced. Will this streak, just like luck, end soon, perhaps with his next release Khel Khel Mein? At the trailer launch of the movie in Mumbai on Friday, Akshay unequivocally answered that “no matter what people say, I’ll keep working”. Sharing a story his father told him, Akshay said, “I’ll tell you one thing. I’ll tell you a short story, a story my father had told me in my childhood. It was about a farmer. One day his cow gets lost. So when his cow is lost all the villages come to him and tell him, ‘I’m very sorry that your cow is lost, we are sad.’ The next day his cow came back and 3-4 other cows came with it. So the villagers return and say, ‘You got four cows now!’ After a few months his son was taking the cows out somewhere, he was sitting on one of the cows and fell and twisted his foot. The villagers say, ‘Your son’s foot got twisted, sorry.’ The next day, the king announces that all the kids have to join military training and go for the war. So this farmer’s son couldn’t go because he had injured his leg. So everybody said how lucky he was that his son doesn’t have to go to war when everybody else’s sons have to go.” He then shared that when his films flop, he receives messages, that sound like condolences, from the fraternity. “What I am trying to say is, jo hota hai acchhe ke liye hi hota hai (whatever happens, happens for the best). I don’t overthink. Four-five films of mine have not worked, I get so many kinds of messages — ‘sorry yaar, fikar mat kar (sorry friend, don’t worry)’. Abey marra nahi hoon main (I am not dead)! It feels like people are sending me obituary messages. One journalist even wrote, ‘Don’t worry, you’ll be back’, I called him up and asked why he wrote this? What does ‘back’ mean? Where have I gone? I am here and I’ll keep working,” he shared. Akshay also said he will keep working despite what people say about him. He said, “Hamesha kaam karte rahunga (I’ll always keep working). Chaahe log kuch bhi bole (it doesn’t matter what people say). In the morning I wake up, exercise, leave for work, and return home. Jo bhi kamata hoon apne dum pe kamata hoon (Whatever I earn, I earn on my own). Kisi ka kuch khaunga nahi main kabhi (I’ll never snatch anything from anyone). I’ll keep on working till they have to shoot me down (to stop me from working).” Akshay’s Khel Khel Mein also stars Vaani Kapoor, Fardeen Khan, and Ammy Virk, among others. The film is scheduled to be released in cinemas on August 15, clashing with Rajkummar Rao and Shraddha Kapoor’s Street 2 which is directed by Amar Kaushik. The Khel Khel Mein trailer gives a shot-out to Stree 2; the two films will clash at the box office on Independence Day. Talking about it, Mudassar Aziz said, “We are all a part of the Hindi film industry. That’s the point. A festive weekend is coming up. I don’t view it as us against them. I love Amar Kaushik, I have great respect for the work he does and I want both our films to do well. That’s what I want. I want Hindi films to do well. We have to work hard enough to make our industry prosper. When a festive weekend like that comes, we should ask our audiences to come in (to cinemas).” About giving a shout-out to Stree 2 in his film’s trailer, he said, “I gave them (makers of Stree 2) a shout-out. If you see the last slate of my trailer, it says, ‘stree aur purush dono dekhe’, it’s my way of calling out to Amar and saying let’s have a great weekend at the box office. Let’s all do well because that’s what Hindi cinema needs.” Opening Weekend Success and Monday Slump Vicky Kaushal’s latest film, “Bad Newz,” co-starring Triptii Dimri and Ammy Virk, saw a… At one point, debates were rampant about who could be the rightful heir to acting legends Sivaji Ganesan and Kamal… The Kerala government approved numerous projects in Wayanad over the past four years, including those related to non-coal mining, without… Your email address will not be published.

"Years after accusing Sanjay Leela Bhansali of being physically, verbally abusive, Ranbir Kapoor revisits his ‘anger’ on Black set","Years after accusing Sanjay Leela Bhansali of being physically, verbally abusive, Ranbir Kapoor revisits his ‘anger’ on Black set  Actor Ranbir Kapoor spoke about starting out in the film industry as an assistant to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, at a time when ‘every filmmaker’ in Bollywood had expressed their desire to work with him. Ranbir said that his father, the late Rishi Kapoor, felt that he was getting too much attention, and sent him abroad to study. When Ranbir returned, he enrolled in the best ‘film school’ that he could find – Bhansali’s set. In an interview with entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, he recalled what a tough taskmaster Bhansali was, and how the experience ‘hardened’ him for the future. Ranbir went on to make his acting debut with Bhansali’s 2007 film, Saawariya. Asked about his beginnings, he said, “When I came back (to India), every director in the film industry wanted to launch me. But I was a big fan of Sanjay Leela Bhansali. I was like, ‘If every director wants to work with me, why isn’t Sanjay Leela Bhansali offering me a movie?’ Maybe he wasn’t aware of me. So, I made a resume and went and sat outside his office.” Also read – Ranbir Kapoor opens up on Animal criticism for first time, reveals people from film industry told him they were ‘disappointed’ in him Ranbir said that the filmmaker agreed to meet him the next day. “Reading my name (on the resume), he understood who I was. I told him I’m a big fan; Devdas had just released. On the first day itself, he told me that he wanted to make a film with me, so my ambition was achieved right there. But those one-and-a-half years that I spent assisting on Black was actually the biggest film school of my life.” Ranbir recalled Bhansali’s famous temper, and said that it prepared him for the future. “He was a very hard taskmaster. We were working 14-15 hours a day. There were 10 other assistants, but I wasn’t (treated like) some special kid because of who I was. I was like everybody else. He was… very short-tempered. There was a lot of anger coming our way, and I think that really hardened me. It really prepared me for anything in life.” At an event in 2021, Ranbir had accused Bhansali of being physically violent with him when they worked together on Black. “When I assisted Mr (Sanjay Leela) Bhansali (on Black), he used to really treat me as an assistant director. I used to be kneeling down for hours, he used to hit us, he used to abuse us… that only hardens you and prepares you for the world,” he said. Ranbir also told Neha Dhupia on her show that he walked out of the project, and vowed to never work with Bhansali again. “He was beating me…after a point it got so heavy and I felt so tortured that I had to quit the film at a point…I think it was like 10 or 11 months into my job and I am like ‘ listen I can’t do this, its getting to me’ I think I am too sensitive and emotional and he got to know me so well and he kind of kept poking into that… he got too much, went crazy as far as I was concerned,” he said. In a recent interview, Bhansali addressed complaints about his temper, and told India Today, “If I’m not getting what I want, even if I lose my temper, what is wrong in it? If you’re not getting a shot, and if someone is spoiling it, what will you do? People have made stories that I’m angry, that I’m badly behaved…” Despite this, Ranbir and Bhansali are set to work together on the film Love & War, which will also feature Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal.

"Imane Khelif is a born woman, not a man: Chinmayi Sripaada defends boxer","Imane Khelif is a born woman, not a man: Chinmayi Sripaada defends Algerian boxer against ‘global trolling’  Singer Chinmayi Sripaada, known for her vocal views on social media and as a woman's rights activist, has spoken in favour of Imane Khelif. The Algerian boxer is being trolled for participating in and dismantling her opponent in a woman's boxing match at Paris Olympics despite failing failing unspecified and untransparent eligibility tests for women's competition from the now-banned International Boxing Association last year. (Also Read – ‘Like a man beats a woman’: Kangana Ranaut reacts to ‘natural male’ boxer breaking opponent’s nose during Olympics) Chinmayi shared a childhood picture of Imane and wrote on X, “Imane Khelif is BORN WOMAN. She is NOT a man. *The right to change their gender is illegal and banned in Algeria, the country she represents.* Indians have harassed and harangued Shanthi Soundarrajan, a brilliant sportswoman, just because she didn’t look the way they expect a woman to look. I hope Imane is OK. She is going through global bullying and it looks horrific. This is Imane Khelif as a child.”  JK Rowling, bestselling British author who wrote the Harry Potter books, was one of those who criticised the participation of Imane in a woman's boxing match. She shared a picture of Imane with her opponent Angela Carini after the match and wrote on X, “Could any picture sum up our new men’s rights movement better? The smirk of a male who’s knows he’s protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he’s just punched in the head, and whose life’s ambition he’s just shattered.”  Chinmayi also responded to JK Rowling by resharing Imane's childhood picture. She wrote in the caption, “How heroes fall. Someone show J K Rowling this photo. I am pretty sure Rowling will have no remorse for what she has globally unleashed on Imane because she belongs to a religion and race the standard white person doesn’t like.”  The International Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams said Friday that Imane Khelif “was born female, was registered female, lived her life as a female, boxed as a female, has a female passport.” He warned “not turn it into some kind of witch hunt.”",True,True,True

Modern Family star Sarah Hyland catches LA house invasion on camera,"Modern Family star Sarah Hyland catches LA house invasion on camera  Adding to a string of celebrity burglaries this year, Sarah Hyland's Los Angeles home just became the newest victim of a scary intrusion – the scariest bit: she saw the hooded housebreakers. The Modern Family star's LA residence was burglarised on Saturday, but it wasn't quite night yet, police sources told TMZ. According to officials' statement, the frightening break-in happened while it was still daylight out. Fortunately, Hyland was not directly at the receiving end of the alarming development as she is said to have been out of town when the crime broke out. Despite her in-person absence, she witnessed the incident as she caught masked individuals breaking into her place after getting an alert from her home security system. Per official claims, the suspects entered Hyland's property by breaking a glass window, alerting her security system. Even though Sarah was away from her sweet abode, she reportedly contacted the police after seeing the surveillance footage on her phone, which caught two masked men walking out of her LA home's front door. Also read   Kanye West's $39m Malibu mansion, which was ‘left to rot,’ finally finds a buyer However, the burglars were long before the cops arrived. Sources told the outlet that the place was as silent as ever by the time law-enforcement officials turned up. Police have yet to arrest any suspect under the ongoing active investigation. As the cops await Hyland's return, it remains unclear if anything valuable was looted from her crib. Sarah would have to conduct an inventory to cross-check possibly missing items and their worth. She's the latest victim to the long list of LA-based robberies this year after stars like Marlon Wayans and Bhad Bhabie's abodes suffered a similar fate. The Modern Family alum purchased the Los Angeles place before marrying The Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams.

Rahul Gandhi to relinquish Wayanad Lok Sabha seat,"Rahul Gandhi to relinquish Wayanad Lok Sabha seat? Kerala's Cong unit chief drops hint  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was elected from two seats in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections -Wayanad in Kerala and Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh. However, he will have to relinquish one seat in the coming days. Now, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief K Sudhakaran has dropped a big hint indicating that Gandhi will likely relinquish the Wayanad seat. While addressing a public meeting on Wednesday, Sudhakaran indicated that Rahul Gandhi might retain the Raebareli seat. He said that the people of Kerala “should not be saddened” as Gandhi cannot be “expected to remain” in Wayanad. “We should not be saddened as Rahul Gandhi who is supposed to lead the nation cannot be expected to remain in Wayanad. Therefore, we should not be sad. Everyone should understand that and give all their wishes and support to him,” Sudhakaran said at the public meeting, where Gandhi was present. Rahul Gandhi, during a public meeting at Edavanna in Malappuram, said that he was in a dilemma over which seat he should relinquish. He said that whichever seat he decides to retain, both constituencies will be happy with the decision. The Congress leader said, ""I have a dilemma before me, whether I should be the MP of Wayanad or of Rae Bareli. What I will commit to you is that both Wayand and Raebareli will be happy with my decision."" According to the Representation of People Act, a candidate can contest from two Lok Sabha constituencies, but can hold only one seat at a time. As per the regulations, the candidate has two weeks to from the date of declaration of the results to decide which seat he wants to retain. The Lok Sabha election results were declared on June 4, which means that Rahul Gandhi will have to announce his final decision before June 18, next Tuesday. In the 2019 general elections, Rahul Gandhi contested from the Amethi and Wayanad seat but lost from the former. Contesting on two seats once again in the 2024 elections, Gandhi won from both Wayanad and Raebareli with a huge margin. In Wayanad, however, the victory margin was smaller than what it was in 2019.",True,True,True

The international agency charged with regulating seabed mining elected a U.N. environmental regulator to replace a leader accused of too-close industry ties.,"Agency Votes to Replace Official Accused of Rushing Start of Seabed Mining  ADVERTISEMENT  The international agency charged with regulating seabed mining elected a U.N. environmental regulator to replace a leader accused of too-close industry ties. By Eric Lipton The international agency charged with regulating seabed mining worldwide voted on Friday to replace its top executive, after accusations that the British lawyer running the agency was too closely aligned with the mining industry. Leticia Carvalho, an oceanographer from Brazil and a United Nations environmental regulator, was elected by a 79-to-34 vote by the nations that run the International Seabed Authority to replace Michael Lodge, a lawyer who has overseen the agency for nearly eight years. “I can’t wait to start to work with state parties and stakeholders at this honorable organization,” Ms. Carvalho said after the vote, which was done by secret ballot. Mr. Lodge has been a polarizing figure at the seabed authority, which has jurisdiction over any future mining in international waters. Environmentalists have argued that he worked behind the scenes with private contractors to try to accelerate the start of mining. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Lodge has vehemently rejected those claims, arguing that he has tried to impartially lead the agency as it works toward opening up small pieces of the ocean floor to mining. More than 30 countries have called for a delay or moratorium on the start of seabed mining. Ms. Carvalho has said she does not support a moratorium on seabed mining or a formal pause in the start of the effort. But in an interview, she said that she did not believe industrial-scale mining could start until environmental regulations are finalized and that it could take several years to do so. Electric Car Factory: The Taiwanese company Foxconn has built a manufacturing hub in Zhengzhou, China, for its star customer Apple, but it is starting almost from scratch in the auto business. An About Face: Donald Trump’s views on E.V.s have shifted since he has grown more friendly with Elon Musk, the billionaire head of Tesla. Cruise Taxi Operations: General Motors said that its Cruise driverless-taxi division had restarted test operations in three Sun Belt cities, using self-driving cars with human safety drivers who would monitor the vehicles and intervene if needed. Corvettes in the E.V. Era: The General Motors sports car sold well after a major design change. Could a fully electric model win over gas-loving customers? The seabed authority, a once-obscure agency overseen by 168 member nations, has become an international focus of attention as the push to phase out gasoline-powered cars has generated a sharp increase in demand for metals like cobalt and nickel, used in electric vehicle batteries. Both are found in high concentrations in certain rocks sitting at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, more than 2.5 miles down, among other locations. The seabed authority is governed by the 42-year-old United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, declaring that any ocean-floor metals in international waters are “the common heritage of mankind.” Mr. Lodge has been pushing the agency over the past several years to finish its work on environmental regulations that will govern seabed mining. His efforts to speed the process have come amid pressure from the Metals Company, a Canadian business that has told investors it intends to start Pacific Ocean mining by early 2026. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Lodge has spent most of his career at the agency, starting as a lawyer in 1996 before he became the legal counsel and secretary general, overseeing the agency staff and its headquarters in Kingston, Jamaica. He was seeking a third term as secretary general, an appointment that lasts four years. The New York Times reported in 2022 that top officials at the agency had provided what certain employees said was confidential data detailing the locations in the Pacific Ocean with some of the highest concentrations of these metal-loaded rocks to executives associated with Metals Company, an allegation that the agency’s lawyers disputed. After Mr. Lodge last year challenged some diplomats who were trying to slow down the finalization of the environmental rules, he was admonished by officials from Germany and Costa Rica. Gina Guillen-Grillo, Costa Rica’s lead representative to the Seabed Authority and a longtime critic of Mr. Lodge, said she welcomed Ms. Carvalho’s election. “A new era is coming to the authority,” she said on Friday, adding that the agency needs a leader who “does not use his post to favor anyone — someone who is not afraid of transparency, and who gives room to accountability.” ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Lodge did not respond on Friday to a request for comment. The seabed authority has approved more than 30 exploration contracts authorizing mapping and other preparatory work in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Now the agency is preparing to consider applications for industrial-scale mining, conducted by bulldozer-like machines dropped to the ocean floor. The first application will almost certainly come from Metals Company, which has said it intends to submit one this year. Gerard Barron, the Metals Company chief executive, said he remained confident that the company schedule to start mining by 2026 was still possible. The company had supported Mr. Lodge’s effort to secure a third term. Kiribati, one of the island nations sponsoring Metals Company’s seabed contract efforts, tried this summer to persuade Ms. Carvalho to drop out of the race in return for an offer to perhaps serve as a deputy to Mr. Lodge, a proposal she rejected. Mr. Barron, who said he was not involved in this effort, welcomed the results. “I think she can bring harmony to the I.S.A. at a time when it could really do with some,” he said on Friday. “Leticia has clearly stated she does not believe in moratoriums but instead wants strong, sensible regulations that can protect the marine environment. Which is 100 percent my own position.” ADVERTISEMENT Environmental groups fighting to slow or stop seabed mining celebrated the ousting of Mr. Lodge. They had accused him of using agency resources to help with his re-election campaign, an assertion he has disputed. “The new secretary general must put the health of the oceans at the heart” of the agency, said Louisa Casson, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace International. Greenpeace has helped organize the effort to block the start of seabed mining. Ms. Casson said the seabed agency had been “driven by the narrow corporate interests of the deep sea mining industry for far too long.” Eric Lipton is an investigative reporter, who digs into a broad range of topics from Pentagon spending to toxic chemicals.

Olympic Champion Simone Biles Posted on Social Media That She Loves her ‘Black Job’,"Simone Biles says she loves her ’black job,’ an apparent clapback at Donald Trump    Published - August 03, 2024 04:37 am IST Simone Biles, of the United States, celebrates after performing in the floor exercise during the women’s artistic gymnastics all-around finals in Bercy Arena at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Thursday, Aug. 1, 2024, in Paris, France.   Photo Credit: AP Olympic gymnastics champion Simone Biles entered the fray of the U.S. presidential race on Friday with a post that appears to clap back at former President Donald Trump’s comment about “Black jobs.” “I love my black job,” Biles posted on X, in response to a post from singer Ricky Davila, who had said: “Iconic photo of the GOAT mastering her black job and collecting Gold Medals.” The exchange came hours after Biles held off Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade to win the all-around Paris Olympics gymnastics finals, taking home her ninth gold medal. At 27, she’s the oldest Olympic women’s gymnastics champ since 1952. Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has been criticized for arguing during his June debate with Democratic President Joe Biden that migrants are taking “Black jobs” and “Hispanic jobs” from Americans. Trump's remark angered critics, who called it a racist and insulting attempt to expand his appeal beyond his white conservative base. When pushed by moderators on what constituted a “Black job,” Trump told attendees at this week’s National Association of Black Journalists conference that “a Black job is anybody that has a job,” drawing groans from the room. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has been critical of Biles before. During a 2021 Fox News Channel appearance, following Biles' withdrawal from that year's Olympics competition to protect her own safety in Tokyo — a self-removal that prompted an international discussion about mental health — Vance questioned why the athlete didn't push forward. “I think it reflects pretty poorly on our sort of therapeutic society that we try to praise people, not for moments of strength, not for moments of heroism, but for their weakest moments,” Vance, who was then running for his Senate seat, said at the time. Trump's campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment on what Biles posted. Biles' representatives also did not immediately return messages seeking further comment on her post or her thoughts generally about the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

Russia releases Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan in historic prisoner swap with West,"Russia releases Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan in historic prisoner swap with West   The United States and Russia carried out a historic prisoner exchange Thursday when two dozen detainees, including former US Marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, were released as part of a sweeping deal that involved at least seven countries. Thursday’s massive swap was the result of years of complicated behind-the-scenes negotiations involving the US, Russia, Belarus and Germany, ultimately leading Berlin to agree to Moscow’s key demand – releasing convicted Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov. A total of eight people, including Krasikov, were swapped back to Russia in exchange for the release of 16 people who were held in Russian detention, including four Americans. In addition to Whelan and Gershkovich, prominent Putin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a US permanent resident, and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva were also freed. RELATED ARTICLE Who was freed in major prisoner swap between Russia and the West? “Not since the Cold War has there been a similar number of individuals exchanged in this way and there has never, so far as we know, been an exchange involving so many countries, so many close US partners and allies working together,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday. By midday, Whelan, Gershkovich and Kurmasheva were on their way back to the US, according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. President Joe Biden called the deal “a feat of diplomacy.” “Some of these women and men have been unjustly held for years. All have endured unimaginable suffering and uncertainty. Today, their agony is over,” Biden said in a statement. Biden later told reporters that the swap was made possible thanks to cooperation from multiple countries. “They joined a difficult, complex negotiation at my request,” he said. “Anyone who questions if allies matter: They do,” Biden said, raising his voice. The president was joined in the White House by family members of Whelan, Gershkovich, Kurmasheva and Kara-Murza. They included Kurmasheva’s daughter Miriam Butorin, who is celebrating her 13th birthday on Friday. At one moment during the news conference, Biden led families and the assembled press in singing “Happy Birthday” to her. Biden gathered the families earlier to relay the news that their loved ones were heading home, Sullivan said. Champagne bottles popped on Thursday inside The Wall Street Journal newsroom as staffers celebrated the release of their colleague Gershkovich. Emma Tucker, The Wall Street Journal’s editor in chief, delivered the official news of Gershkovich’s freedom to the newsroom just before noon on Thursday, calling it “a historic day” for the paper. “Evan and his family have displayed unrivaled courage, resilience and poise during this ordeal, which came to an end because of broad advocacy for his release around the world,” Tucker and Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal publisher Almar Latou said in a statement. Sullivan described the negotiations as “painstaking,” and made all the more complicated by Russia’s war in Ukraine and “the overall degradation of our relations with Russia.” The negotiations, which initially focused on securing the release of Whelan, were made even more difficult when the Russians detained Gershkovich and Kurmasheva. “It became clear that the Russians would not agree to the release of these individuals without an exchange that included Vadim Krasikov, a Russian criminal who was in German custody, not someone we could offer ourselves,” Sullivan said. “That required extensive diplomatic engagement with our German counterparts starting at the top with the President himself, who worked this issue directly with Chancellor Scholz.” Krasikov was convicted of the murder in 2019 of the former Chechen fighter Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili in Berlin. The German court that convicted him in 2021 said he acted on behalf of the Russian state, shooting his victim “execution style” in broad daylight. Khangoshvili fought against Russian forces during the Chechen wars and later relocated to Georgia, where he survived several assassination attempts. Wanted in Russia on terror charges, he was a particular thorn in the side of Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader and close ally of Putin. Putin hinted at his interest in bringing Krasikov back, telling the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in February that “an agreement can be reached” to release a man whom he said “eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals” motivated by “patriotic reasons.” Germany did not comment at the time. RELATED LIVE-STORY Americans Gershkovich and Whelan released from Russia after historic prisoner swap The number of people Germany is getting in exchange for Krasikov – five German nationals and seven Russian opposition figures – is indicative of the severity of his crime and his high profile. Among the Germans returning home is Rico Krieger, who was sentenced to death in Belarus in July after being charged with terrorism and mercenary activities. Krieger was pardoned by the Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko this week. The Russian dissidents released by Russia as part of the deal include several high-profile activists – Kremlin critic Ilya Yashin, the former head of the Nobel Prize-winning organization “Memorial,” Oleg Orlov, and several former staffers from the anti-corruption foundation of Russian dissident Alexey Navalny. Rumors of a possible imminent swap began circulating earlier this week, when several of the Russian dissidents, including Kara-Murza, went missing from their prison colonies, with their lawyers and families raising alarm. “Other nations were also critical to securing this deal – Norway, Slovenia and Poland all had custody of additional Russians included in this exchange,” Sullivan said. “We also are deeply grateful to Turkey for providing the critical logistic support that has made this deal possible.” US officials engaged in months of quiet conversations with the German counterparts about the possibility of releasing Krasikov. Blinken raised it with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock at a G7 meeting in April 2023, but she was not on board, according to a US official familiar with the matter. Sullivan also repeatedly raised it with his counterpart. Biden then brought the conversations to the highest level in the German system: Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Over a phone call in January, Biden told him that discussing a trade with Russia that included Krasikov would be an item that he planned to discuss with the German leader in their upcoming White House meeting. When they discussed the matter in February in the Oval Office the Biden administration felt that things were moving in the right direction, a second administration official said. After that meeting, Sullivan was regularly passing lists of possible Russians who could be swapped to Berlin. But tentative plans in the works that involved the release of Krasikov for Navalny were dealt a blow when Navalny died in a remote Russian penal colony. On the same day that the US learned the news of Navalny’s death, Sullivan held a previously scheduled meeting with Gershkovich’s parents. RELATED ARTICLE Biden celebrates prisoner deal and importance of allies in key moment for his legacy “The team felt like the wind had been taken out of our sails in terms of efforts to get Paul and Evan back home,” a senior administration official said. “Jake, however, saw differently and he stressed to both Ella and Mikhail that he still saw a path forward.” Sullivan instructed his team “to come up with some additional options to make it politically viable, particularly politically viable to the Germans,” the senior administration official said. The negotiations across the interagency – up to the level of Scholz and Biden – eventually led to the list of the dozen political prisoners released from Russia Thursday. At the same time, the US began reaching out to allies who had Russian spies in their custody to see who else they could include to get Russia to agree. According to a second US official, Scholz agreed to the deal in early June, after Biden wrote him a letter in late April. The Russians agreed to the deal about two weeks ago. The senior administration official defended the release of Krasikov as part of the deal.

Freed American’s family to miss Taylor Swift concert for the very best reason,"Freed American's family to miss Taylor Swift concert for the very best reason  By Jennifer Hansler, CNN (CNN) — Miriam Butorin was supposed to attend Taylor Swift’s concert on Friday for her 13th birthday. She is missing it, but for the very best reason. Miriam’s mother, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, was released Thursday from Russian detention in a historic prisoner swap. The release of the 47-year-old journalist for the US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty was part of a complex prisoner swap between Russia, the US and other Western nations involving 24 detainees in total, including fellow freed Americans Evan?Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. Kurmasheva had been detained in October 2023 and found guilty of spreading false information about the Russian army – charges her family and employer deny. Kurmasheva’s family joined President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday, where he shared the news that she was on her way back to the United States. There, the president led the crowd in singing happy birthday to Miriam. Minutes before midnight, in an incredibly emotional scene, she was reunited with her mother on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Kurmasheva was the final freed American to emerge from the aircraft that touched down late Thursday. She hugged Biden and the president pressed his forehead to hers. Kurmasheva also greeted Vice President Kamala Harris before running to her daughters and husband. When CNN spoke with Kurmasheva’s family in mid-July, her husband, Pavel Butorin, had mentioned the concert tickets. “We were so confident that she would get back to us that I bought Taylor Swift tickets…in June or July…for August 2024,” Butorin said at the time. “Little did we know that she would be arrested and taken away from us.” Just a matter of weeks ago, there was little sign of Kurmasheva being released from Russian detention – and of the family being able to attend the concert in Warsaw together. Even though they are missing Friday’s concert, Butorin expressed confidence the family would still get to go to a Swift concert in the future. Thursday, he said, was an incredible day.

Hunter Biden won’t be sentenced on gun charges until after presidential election,"Hunter Biden won’t be sentenced on gun charges until after presidential election  Hunter Biden is set to be sentenced on his gun crime convictions days after the 2024 election. Federal Judge Maryellen Noreika has scheduled the sentencing proceeding in Delaware’s federal court for November 13, according to an order from the court on Friday. Election Day is November 5. The timing keeps the consequence of Hunter Biden’s conviction hanging over the election season, as his father, President Joe Biden, is still likely to play a significant role politically even though he is no longer running for reelection. Hunter Biden faces a maximum sentence of up to 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000 at sentencing. He also faces an upcoming second federal criminal trial, on tax charges in California, that could complicate his sentencing. That trial is currently scheduled to take place in September. In Delaware’s federal court, a jury unanimously voted to convict Hunter Biden in June on three felony gun charges intended to prevent drug addicts from possessing firearms. He had bought a gun in October 2018 and told the gun shop he wasn’t addicted to or using drugs around the time of the purchase. Hunter Biden’s lawyers have indicated they plan to challenge the verdict and the underlying law around the gun charges in an effort to overturn the conviction, but that may not hold off the sentencing date. The punishment will be decided by Noreika, who was named to the bench by former President Donald Trump and confirmed with bipartisan support. Federal law requires her to consider the circumstances of the specific offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need to deter Hunter Biden from future criminal activity and to hand down a punishment that promotes “respect for the law.” The trial put on display a scathing portrait of a drug addict with a messy personal life. The upcoming tax trial, also being prosecuted by special counsel David Weiss, is likely to revisit some of those same themes. The president does have extensive power to commute a sentence or issue a pardon, though Biden said previously he had ruled out pardoning his son. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Russia pulled back weapons shipment to Houthis amid US and Saudi pressure,"Russia pulled back weapons shipment to Houthis amid US and Saudi pressure  Russia was preparing to deliver missiles and other military equipment to the Houthi rebels in Yemen late last month but pulled back at the last minute amid a flurry of behind-the-scenes efforts by the United States and Saudi Arabia to stop it, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The Saudis, who were locked in a brutal war with the Houthis for years before the US helped to negotiate a fragile truce in 2022, warned Russia against arming one of their biggest adversaries upon learning of the plans, the sources said. The US, which has been involved in several diplomatic efforts to stop the Russians from arming the Iran-backed rebels, separately asked the Saudis to help convince Moscow not to pursue the effort, two of the sources said. The US-Saudi discussions and the imminent weapons transfer have not been previously reported. The Saudi Embassy in the US declined to comment and the Kremlin did not return a request for comment. The US designated the Houthis as a global terrorist organization in January, following months of Houthi missile and drone attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea that killed several mariners and hobbled global trade. Despite several rounds of sanctions and US military attacks on Houthi weapons infrastructure, however, the rebels have continued to attack commercial ships in the crucial waterway. A senior US official declined to discuss the specifics of Russia’s plans to arm the Houthis. But the official said that the US regards any attempt by a third party to bolster the Houthis’ weapons supplies “as antithetical to the goals we are pursuing” when it comes to achieving a lasting peace settlement in Yemen between the Houthis and the Saudis, and helping to stabilize the region. For the Houthis to engage in that kind of weapons transaction, moreover, “would demonstrate to us a lack of commitment” by the Houthis to peace talks, the official said. Currently, the Houthis “appear to be drifting further away from a commitment to a negotiated peace in Yemen,” the official said. It remains unclear to the US intelligence community whether Saudi Arabia’s pushback was the key to Russia abandoning its plan to arm the Houthis, or whether it was just one of a number of factors that led Russian President Vladimir Putin to change his mind, the sources said. The Russians have viewed arming and advising the Houthis as a way to retaliate against the Biden administration for its decision to allow Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory using US-provided weapons, officials said. And while the imminent weapons transfer was pulled back, Russia did deploy military personnel to Yemen to help advise the Houthis over a three-day period in late July, the sources said. US officials watched as large Russian ships made an unusual stop in the southern Red Sea, where the Russian personnel disembarked, were picked up by the Houthis in a boat, and ferried to Yemen, the sources said. The Russians carried bags with them, but nothing that appeared large enough to carry weapons or weapons components, the sources said. It is not clear whether the Russian ships were carrying the equipment that Russia had been preparing to transfer to the Houthis before the Kremlin abandoned the plan. Before and during the Russians’ visit to Yemen, the Houthis took the unusual step of issuing a notice to mariners, which alerts ships to potential dangers at sea. A US official said intelligence indicated that the Houthis had intended to conduct live fire exercises while hosting the Russians, but those plans appear to have been scrapped, too. The Houthis began their near-daily attacks on ships transiting the Red Sea in November 2023, prompting the US and UK to conduct several rounds of airstrikes inside Yemen to try to eliminate their weapons infrastructure. The strikes do not appear to have significantly impacted the Houthis’ stockpiles, and the rebel group even showed signs of being willing to sell some weapons to the Somali militant group al-Shabaab in June, CNN previously reported. But their supply is not infinite, particularly because the US has sanctioned several entities over the last few months — primarily out of China and Oman — believed to be supplying the group with weapons components. The Houthis are also in particular need of new radar systems, which US Central Command forces have regularly targeted to try to blunt the Houthis’ missile attacks. There have been indications as well that the Houthis’ primary patron, Iran, has had some concerns about the group’s attack strategy, whereas Russia has been critical of the US and UK attacks on the Houthis. © 2024 Cable News Network.

"Secret Service should have watched roof used by Trump rally shooter, acting director says","New video shows gunman outside Trump rally site before July shooting  Watch CBS News By Layla Ferris, Amelia Donhauser August 21, 2024 / 12:43 PM EDT / CBS News Newly surfaced video footage shows Thomas Matthew Crooks walking outside the grounds of the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, less than two hours before he opened fire on July 13.  The four-second clip shows 20-year-old Crooks walking by a row of vendor tents selling Trump merchandise. The footage was captured by Joe Tomko, who owns Iron Clad USA, a merchandise company. Tomko said he has sent the video to the FBI.  CBS News confirmed the footage was captured outside the secure perimeter of the rally. The video's timestamp indicates it was filmed at 4:26 p.m. — one hour and 45 minutes before Crooks opened fire.  The video places Crooks around half a mile away from the AGR building that he later used as his firing position. A countersniper from a local tactical team photographed Crooks outside the AGR building less than an hour after this video was filmed, at around 5:14 p.m. Location of Matthew Thomas Crooks walking along vendors row to Trump Rally in Butler PA at 4:26pm 7/23/2024. @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @elonmusk @FoxNews @CNN @Newsweek @abcnews @CBSNews @NBCNews #butlerfarmshow pic.twitter.com/NDsY098x6r FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said before Congress that the first reported sighting of Crooks by local law enforcement was at approximately 4:26 p.m. Text messages released by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley showed a local countersniper texted his colleagues about a suspicious person close to the AGR building at around 4:26 p.m. However, this footage places Crooks in a different location, around half a mile away from the AGR building, at that time. It's unclear if the suspicious person the countersniper saw near the AGR building was in fact Crooks. CBS News has reached out to the FBI and local officials to clarify. The video also provides insight into Crooks' movements between when he flew a drone close to the rally site and when he was photographed outside the AGR building after 5 p.m. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before House lawmakers in July that the FBI believed Crooks flew a drone roughly 200 yards away from the stage at around 3:50 p.m. for approximately 11 minutes. ""It appears that around 3:50 p.m., 4:00, in that window, on the day of the shooting, that the shooter was flying the drone around the area,"" Wray said. Wray said law enforcement investigators recovered the drone in Crooks' vehicle, and the bureau believes he was watching video streamed from the device to scout the area.  The local countersniper team reported seeing Crooks walking around the AGR building between 5:10 p.m. and 5:38 p.m., before law enforcement officers lost sight of him again. A little after 6 p.m., as Trump began speaking, Crooks climbed on the roof of the building and opened fire.  Layla Ferris is a verification producer with CBS News Confirmed.

Judge Chutkan could jumpstart Trump election interference case now that it’s back in her court,"Judge Chutkan could jumpstart Trump election interference case now that it’s back in her court  A federal judge in Washington, DC, on Friday regained control of the criminal case against former President Donald Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, leaving the historic case’s fate in her hands less than 100 days before the November election. The case was returned to Judge Tanya Chutkan one month after the Supreme Court issued a game-changing ruling on presidential power. RELATED ARTICLE Exclusive: The inside story of John Roberts and Trump’s immunity win at the Supreme Court Chutkan has long signaled she wanted the case presented to a jury before voters go to the polls in November, initially pushing for a March trial date. But the Supreme Court interceded earlier this year and put the case on pause to consider Trump’s claims of presidential immunity. By granting Trump sweeping immunity for official acts as president, the Supreme Court’s ruling may gut special counsel Jack Smith’s case. That leaves Chutkan with a number of crucial decisions to make, including whether Trump’s efforts to undo the 2020 election results count as official acts. Attorneys working on the case believe that Chutkan will move quickly with the case back in her jurisdiction, according to sources familiar with their thinking. She could soon set the schedule for any upcoming hearings. Meanwhile, prosecutors in Smith’s office have been preparing to move ahead with the case, even though they face a more difficult path as some evidence obtained in the investigation may be considered off limits because of the Supreme Court ruling, including testimony from former Vice President Mike Pence and other close Trump aides who worked in the White House. Any move she makes will be under extreme scrutiny, given that it’s the only remaining federal case against Trump after the Florida federal judge overseeing his classified documents case, Aileen Cannon, dismissed those criminal charges against Trump and his two co-defendants. As one attorney who practices in front of her said Chutkan “is very aware that the eyes of the world are on her.” Chutkan has been on the federal bench for a decade. In the past three years, she has presided over dozens of January 6 criminal prosecutions, and is known as a harsh sentencer for those convicted of charges related to the US Capitol riot. Seated in her courtroom just blocks away from the Capitol, she is intimately familiar with the violence that unfolded that day and has warned Trump supporters in her court such an episode can never happen again. “We’re running up against another bitterly contested election,” Chutkan told one riot defendant last month. “I wish I could go somewhere until it’s over, but I can’t.” RELATED ARTICLE Garland on special counsel appointment ruling: ‘Do I look like someone who would make that basic mistake about the law?’ Since Chutkan was assigned the 2020 election interference case against Trump more than a year ago, she has kept Trump’s attorneys and the special counsel on a short leash in the courtroom and has often been quick to schedule hearings or rule on motions. The judge already has decided 15 major pre-trial issues, ruling in favor of special counsel prosecutors in most of those. She’s also rejected a series of motions by Trump’s lawyers, including refusing to strike language that Trump believed was “inflammatory” from the indictment and to dismiss the case entirely based on his First Amendment claims. Chutkan also approved Smith’s request to place Trump under a gag order for the duration of the case, but in a few instances she has dinged prosecutors, most recently for submitting court filings while the case was supposed to be on hold for the Supreme Court’s deliberations. Attorneys who have practiced in front of Chutkan and some who went up against her when she was a public defender described her as “fair minded” and said that she “holds herself to a really, really high standard.” The attorneys spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the professional and ethical risks of speaking to press about a sitting federal judge. “Tanya’s just above the fray,” one of the attorneys said. “She doesn’t make it personal. If she disagreed with you, she tells you.” While it’s still not clear when – if ever – the case will go to trial, observers believe Chutkan will move quickly to move the criminal proceedings along given her judicial style. “She likes to move cases along,” the same attorney told CNN of Chutkan. “She doesn’t want to want a lot of talk, she’ll just rule.” Five major motions are pending before the judge, four of which she could rule on immediately. Sources say that some of the attorneys involved in the case believe Chutkan may have worked on writing opinions for outstanding motions while the case was paused, and that those motions could quickly appear on the court docket. RELATED VIDEO How Amy Coney Barrett broke away from Chief Justice Roberts on Trump immunity ruling Other attorneys have taken issue with her briskness in the Trump case, saying such a high-profile and complex prosecution should be treated differently, and that the former president shouldn’t be forced to go to trial before he is ready. “The concept of any federal criminal case with that level of complexity being tried in under two years is really unheard of,” said Tim Parlatore, a former Trump attorney and CNN commentator. Another one of the attorneys who practice in DC District Court told CNN they believe Chutkan “would try, if she could” to get Trump’s case before a jury before his inauguration in 2025, should he win the presidency and the case presumably goes away. “In her defense, she likes to move her docket,” the attorney said of the fast pace Chutkan keeps in her courtroom. “If in her mind she thinks that Trump is trying to run the clock out, she would try to not allow it.” The scrutiny around Chutkan is particularly intense after Cannon, the federal judge in Florida, dismissed a separate indictment against Trump for his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Chutkan and Cannon can appear diametrically opposed, from their careers to their demeanors. Chutkan was a public defender earlier in her career, while Cannon was a prosecutor. RELATED ARTICLE Isolated and inexperienced: A portrait of the judge overseeing Trump’s documents case from veterans of her courtroom Cannon appeared to hold hearings on nearly every motion in the Trump case before her, but Chutkan often rules without hearing from the parties in person. And while Cannon was criticized for moving too slowly, playing into Trump’s strategy of delay, critics say Chutkan moving so quickly through the case is unfair. One person close to Chutkan told CNN that she does seek counsel in other judges, particularly from those in the same courthouse, while those around Cannon have described her as isolated and not prone to seek counsel on how to handle any complex matters. But the two have been accused of the same thing: putting their thumbs on the scale during two of the highest profile and consequential criminal cases in recent American history. To be sure, the two Trump cases involve vastly different facts and legal issues. And the attorneys are taking different approaches – most notably with the special counsel’s office. In Florida, Trump’s lawyers argued that Smith’s appointment was unconstitutional – and won. In Washington, Trump’s lawyers have said publicly they don’t plan to lodge such a challenge, so that’s one dispute Chutkan won’t have to decide.

"Kamala Harris has earned enough votes to win the Democratic presidential nomination, party chair announces","Kamala Harris has earned enough votes to win the Democratic presidential nomination, party chair announces  Vice President Kamala Harris has won enough votes from Democratic delegates to win the party’s nomination for president, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison announced Friday. Harris will become the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. The announcement came during a virtual event with supporters Friday. Delegates began casting virtual ballots for the nomination Thursday, a process that will continue until Monday evening. “I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States,” said Harris, who joined the virtual event. “I will officially accept your nomination next week, once the virtual voting period is closed.” “Later this month, we will gather in Chicago, united as one party, where we’re going to have an opportunity to celebrate this historic moment together,” the vice president added. It’s been clear since shortly after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris that the vice president would be the only serious candidate for the nomination. Virtually the entire party, including potential challengers, quickly endorsed her, and it took less than 36 hours for her to secure unofficial endorsements from enough delegates to be the party’s nominee. RELATED ARTICLE ‘There was no excitement. Now, there’s tons’: How Harris’ candidacy has energized plans for the DNC Harris is the only name on the ballot, as she was the only candidate to a gather the 300 delegate signatures necessary to qualify. Harris’ path to the nomination stands in stark contrast to her 11-month presidential run in 2020, when she dropped out ahead of the Iowa caucuses. Biden later named Harris as his running mate, a decision that positioned her to take on the party mantle after he stepped aside last month. As the official nomination process has unfolded, Harris has spent the past nearly two weeks reorienting the campaign she inherited on a truncated timeline. Her campaign said Friday it had raked in a whopping $310 million in its July fundraising efforts, buoyed by renewed energy within the party over her candidacy. The haul also more than doubled what Republican nominee Donald Trump’s political operation said it had raised last month. Harris is also in the final stages of choosing her running mate. A source familiar with the vetting process told CNN that the vice president is expected to meet with the top finalists over the weekend, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Harris and her vice presidential nominee will spend next week campaigning across the battleground states, starting with a Tuesday night rally in Philadelphia. Though voting for the Democratic nomination began and will possibly conclude before Harris announces her running mate, party rules don’t require a separate vote to confirm the nominee for vice president. While the official voting is taking place virtually, delegates will have a ceremonial roll call at the Democratic convention in Chicago, which begins August 19.

How Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 campaign built the base driving his VP buzz,"How Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 campaign built the base driving his VP buzz  When Pete Buttigieg launched his presidential bid in the spring of 2019, he acknowledged that — at least on paper — he didn’t strike the image of a winning candidate. “I recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor,” he told the crowd in his hometown of South Bend, Indiana, which he led for two four-year terms. “More than a little bold, at age 37, to seek the highest office in the land.” Five years later, Buttigieg is once again in the running for one of the highest offices, against a field with much longer resumes jostling  to join Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket. That he’s made it to this point speaks to the strength of his appeal among Democrats, bolstered by years of well-received media appearances and viral moments in congressional hearings. But it also demonstrates the durability of the movement he built as a presidential candidate — particularly online — that propelled him to a narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses and a close second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary. “I think what we’re seeing here is an extension of the support, the excitement and the base from his presidential run,” said George Hornedo, a Democratic strategist and Buttigieg’s 2020 deputy national political director. “They’ve stayed ready, and they’ve been supportive of the many things Pete’s been doing in the administration.” Buttigieg has continued to build his brand as a Democrat willing to talk to anyone, anywhere — including Fox News — even as transportation secretary. His digital army has kept track, amplifying department initiatives and congressional hearings. RELATED VIDEO Buttigieg responds to Vance’s criticism of childless Democrats Over the past few days, as speculation over who Harris will pick for her running mate has surged, Buttigieg’s supporters have amplified clips from the wave of media appearances he’s done to promote Harris’ campaign and to mobilize on her behalf. Buttigieg isn’t the only politician to exit a Democratic presidential primary with an enduring army of online super fans. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders’ grassroots supporters continued to propel him long after his 2016 campaign, and the 2020 campaign birthed Andrew Yang’s “Yang Gang.” Harris’ “K-Hive” formed before she ran for president and has spent the years since the 2020 election hyping her wins and defending her record. “Team Pete” didn’t disappear, but the “veepstakes” reactivated his supporters, said Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg’s 2020 campaign manager. “Joe Biden making this incredible, selfless, historic decision created this explosion of energy for Kamala Harris in the Democratic Party, but it’s also created a mini campaign for who’s going to be her running mate,” he said. “And I think that these folks are just passionate about Pete.” On Thursday evening, a few hundred supporters gathered on a “Team Pete for Kamala Harris” Zoom, one of several affinity group-based fundraising calls, to bond over their appreciation of the secretary and raise money for the vice president. The call included several of Buttigieg’s top 2020 endorsers, including mayors and local election officials, and organizers. Attendees agreed to follow the “rules of the road,” the 10 principles that guided Buttigieg’s presidential bid, and “no VP talk!” The call raised about $16,000 for the Harris campaign, according to Joseph Guarino, a call organizer who hosted “Team Pete” debate watch parties in New York City during the 2020 campaign. “Our event was in no way affiliated with Pete Buttigieg in any way, nor did he provide instruction or inspiration in any form,” Guarino said in an email. “Just some grassroots enthusiasts looking to flex their muscles for Kamala Harris.” Harris is expected to make her decision by Tuesday, when she and her running mate will hold a rally in Philadelphia. Among the candidates she is considering, Buttigieg is not considered a top contender on the level of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, CNN reported this week. This week, though, he joined the list of vice presidential hopefuls to cancel a planned event with limited explanation. Buttigieg toured a manufacturing training labs at a community college in Kokomo, Indiana, on Friday and spoke with reporters, but a Department of Transportation spokesperson said he would no longer be hosting a roadway safety roundtable later in the day due to “unforeseen scheduling constraints.” Asked Friday if he could explain what those conflicts were, Buttigieg responded, “No.” Buttigieg is among the contenders expected to meet with Harris over the weekend, either virtually or in person, as she nears a decision, a source familiar with the vetting process told CNN. The former mayor’s fans and allies frequently refer to him as the most effective communicator in the Democratic party and praise his ability to break down Republican arguments in a plainspoken manner. They reject the idea that America isn’t ready for a major-party ticket featuring both a Black woman and the first out gay vice presidential pick. Rep. Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat who supports Buttigieg, brought up the topic, calling it “incredibly frustrating.” “I harken back to serving in combat,” he said. “We didn’t care if the person next to us was gay or straight, whether they were male or female, Black or White, whatever their religion was. We cared about getting the job done. And clearly that’s what Secretary Buttigieg is about.” RELATED ARTICLE Harris campaign says it raised $310 million in July, doubling Trump’s haul Ryan, who is facing a competitive reelection race in upstate New York, was among the first House Democrats to call for Biden to step aside. He’s since publicly backed Buttigieg for Harris’ running mate. “It’s an existential situation to stop (Donald) Trump and MAGA and all he stands for, so my decision to call on Biden was really grounded in that,” Ryan told CNN. “It’s the same rationale that drove me to to say that I think Secretary Buttigieg would be the strongest teammate, with Vice President Harris, to make clear what the threat is.” But some also acknowledge that, if the debate centers around battleground math, the Indiana native doesn’t bring as much to the ticket as rivals like Shapiro. (Though Buttigieg switched his residency to his husband’s home state of Michigan a few years ago, he’s never run for office there.) “I think if you left it up to the delegates, he’d be a shoo-in,” said Virginia Rep. Don Beyer, an early 2020 Buttigieg endorser who knocked on doors in Iowa for his campaign. “But I completely respect that Vice President Harris has to make a decision based on what helps her win the most Electoral College votes. And I don’t know that that’s Pete.” Nina Smith, a traveling press secretary for the Buttigieg 2020 campaign, pointed to his work as transportation secretary promoting the administration’s policies as she made the case for him. While she’d like to see him chosen, the mini campaign around the possible picks had showcased a broad range of candidates. “It’s kind of delightful, as a Democratic operative, to look and see how deep of a bench we have,” Smith said. And if it doesn’t work out this time, there’s always next time. “I definitely think in my lifetime he will be on a ticket,” said Brandon Neal, a Democratic strategist and senior adviser to the 2020 campaign. “There’s no doubt about it. It’s just a matter of when.” This story has been updated with additional reporting. CNN’s Jamie Gangel and Ali Main contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Some Jewish Democrats wonder if America is ready for a Jewish vice president,"Some Jewish Democrats wonder if America is ready for a Jewish vice president   Josh Shapiro’s advisers debated the early seconds of his first ad of the 2022 Pennsylvania governor’s campaign: He was going to start by saying that he makes sure to be home every Friday night for dinner with his family. But should his script call it “Sabbath dinner”? Should the shot of the table show a challah bread? After all, the last time a guy named Shapiro had been elected governor of Pennsylvania, he had years earlier anglicized his name to Shapp. The answers were yes and yes. Shapiro’s wife Lori even baked the braided loaves herself. Now, with Shapiro very much in contention in Kamala Harris’ rushed running mate search, the Democratic world – already divided over the politics of Israel in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack – is wondering whether the US would really be ready for a Jewish vice president — and the first Black and South Asian woman president, who happens to be married to a Jewish man. While there is another Jewish governor, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, who has also already been through two rounds of vetting interviews with Harris’ staff, it’s the Pennsylvania governor – with his outspoken views on Judaism and Israel – who has been the focus as Harris aides are looking at who would help the ticket. Shapiro’s home battleground state isn’t the only factor; the conversation is also about his potential wider appeal in the “Blue Wall” states, about how Jewish populations are bigger than the 2020 margins of victory in many battlegrounds, and how his selection would play with the Arab American population in Michigan and progressives overall. Some pro-Palestinian organizers, amplified by groups like the Democratic Socialists of America and the Sunrise Movement, have been taken to calling him “Genocide Josh” on social media — even though the governor has never cast a vote on any foreign policy issue and the statements he has made about Israel have been more pointed than other prospects, but not substantively different. “I’m not aware of how his position on Israel differs from the other potential vice presidents,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, who is both Jewish and a proud progressive, told CNN. Among even many Jewish Democrats who are Shapiro fans, excitement about the prospect of his being the pick is mixed with pride, anxiety and fear of what sort of divisions and conspiracy theories his selection could set off. “Is the antisemitism going to increase because now you’d have the person who sleeps next to her and the person who would be her closest political ally are both Jewish?” asked one Jewish former Democratic statewide leader outside of Pennsylvania who is a Shapiro fan. “Does it make it more dangerous for those of us in the Jewish community?” Rep. Greg Landsman – an Ohio congressman whose tattoos include a passage from the Book of Micah in Hebrew on his left shoulder – said it’s a real question of whether America would be ready for a Jewish vice president, or at least a Jewish running mate. “Some folks would be, others no,” Landsman told CNN. “There is a lot of Jew hate out there. I’ve experienced it. We all have. And there are folks on the far right that have made it worse, and folks on the far left that have made it worse. But that’s true for most issues.” Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, who was the president of a synagogue in the Las Vegas suburbs before getting into politics, said she’d be “thrilled” if Shapiro were the choice. “It’s really great to have representation and to have someone who understands what it means to work to fight antisemitism and all forms of hate, what it means to do a lot of these things,” she said. Simone Zimmerman – a co-founder of the group IfNotNow, made up of Jews opposed to the Israeli offensive in Gaza and American support for the Israeli government – said Shapiro would be a problem with the party base because he has “significantly more divisive positions on one important issue that a lot of us care about in a way that is disqualifying.” “Chalking all of this up to antisemitism,” Zimmerman said, “is once again a way to distract from an honest conversation about his agenda.” Others argue that the risk of dividing the party is too high. “The party is incredibly united at this moment. Of the VP’s choices, Shapiro is the one who stands out as the most divisive and could put a stop in everyone being on the same page,” said one Jewish Democratic operative. “We have to be realistic. We have to understand the stakes and what it takes to win and that’s going to require a lot of Democratic energy.” Shapiro has set a record for getting more votes than any other Democrat in Pennsylvania in each of his races, although he faced weak GOP opponents. Along the way, he earned support from Black ministers who have talked about connecting to him through faith, Catholics who trusted him when he took on the church in a massive abuse scandal he investigated and prosecuted while state attorney general, and just this week a Muslim leader wrote an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer about how the governor for years has “had our back.” But Shapiro is a different kind of Jewish politician than many who have come before. He’s not an Orthodox Jew like the late Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman — whose stringent adherence was so infamous that his friend, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, even made a joke about it at his memorial service in Washington last week. Shapiro is nonetheless more observant than many in public life and more apt to talk about it. There have been more than two dozen Jewish governors in the US, but he’s the first to perform the ceremony making the kitchen in the governor’s mansion kosher, and nearly every speech he gives includes a riff on a famous Jewish teaching that “no one is required to complete the task, but neither are we free to refrain from it.” His aides and advisers argue that rather than a liability, Shapiro’s faith has been a way of making connections, of building trust. They say polling can’t empirically measure the impact, but argue it demonstrates his authenticity and helps explain his high popularity in a big and diverse state with a very small Jewish population. “He’s been pretty powerfully talking about his faith in a way that doesn’t just appeal to Jews, but folks across a pretty wide swath who are religious and not religious,” said one Jewish Democratic operative who has worked with Shapiro. “It is a part of how he’s been able to earn such significant support across different parts of the electorate.” But that was all running on his own, not as the potential addition to a ticket going up against a Republican nominee who this week agreed with a radio host that second gentleman Doug Emhoff is “a crappy Jew,” said that Harris herself “doesn’t like Jewish people” or that Jews who vote for Democrats “should have their head examined.” Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor who is Jewish but was never affiliated or observant, recalled a time in his first campaign, for Philadelphia district attorney in 1977, when he was introduced to a local political leader as running against “some Yid.” Rendell said then that he had been so shocked and so cowed that he didn’t even point out the slur technically applied to him as well. Rendell said he believes things have changed in the last 45 years. “There were a lot of people who don’t like Jews who voted for Josh Shapiro because they said he’s different,” Rendell said. Shapiro has been keeping a low profile through the vetting process and declined through a spokesperson to be interviewed. But speaking to CNN on his campaign bus riding through western Pennsylvania in late October 2022, days before being elected governor, Shapiro said he was eager for people to know about his connection to Judaism. “That is what motivates me. It really is. I think if you want to be someone’s governor, they’ve got to know who you are as a person, what motivates you,” Shapiro told CNN. “That’s why I always talk about it. I talk about my faith because I want people to know what calls me to service.” Shapiro brushed aside questions about how his Republican opponent in that race attacked him for going to a Jewish day school, trafficked in antisemitic tropes and faced criticism for his ties to a website known for its antisemitic content. “I’m not going to let him or his attacks on my faith dictate how I practice my faith or how I speak. But I will say his attacks, this might surprise you, don’t bother me personally,” Shapiro said at the time. “They really don’t. What bothers me is the way he shows others that he’s disrespecting them by virtue of how he attacks my faith.” Long before Shapiro started plotting his political career, he and his father traveled to a variety of Jewish communities to raise awareness about the “refuseniks,” or Soviet Jews who felt oppressed but were being stopped from emigrating to Israel or the United States. He formed a group called Children for Avi, named after his pen pal, of 50 kids across the country writing letters protesting the situation. An article in the local paper in 1986 about Shapiro’s bar mitzvah includes a photo of the rabbi blessing the 13-year-old future governor and the Soviet boy, who was able to attend because Sen. Ted Kennedy appealed to Mikhail Gorbachev to get the family out of the country after 14 years of their trying. That sensibility carried through Shapiro’s political career including in June, when he and Emhoff were among the featured speakers at a groundbreaking for the new Tree of Life synagogue outside of Pittsburgh to replace the building where, in 2018, an antisemite with an assault rifle killed 11 and wounded six others at Saturday morning services. Shapiro used the Hebrew phrase referring to the connection between generations and the Yiddish word for praying. He spoke about seeing the bullet holes when he toured the sanctuary with his children. “Remembrance cannot be a passive act,” he said, and later decried that at this moment, “Some leaders at times offer permission slips to hate.” With these roots, several people who have known Shapiro for years say it’s no surprise that he has stood up strongly in support of Israel and called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “one of the worst leaders of all time,” but that when he saw some protests on campuses tipping into antisemitism, he felt the need to speak out. Pushing back on some advisers who urged him to hold back, Shapiro said he was listening to the tone of some of the protests and believed that that the atmosphere was getting dangerous. After joining the criticism of the university presidents who struggled to condemn antisemitism during congressional hearings last fall, Shapiro said universities were failing in their obligation to keep students safe. He said that people who had moved into antisemitic chants and behavior were being excused and that there would be no tolerance for people “dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia,” outraging some pro-Palestinian activists with the comparison. Shapiro’s popularity stayed high in Pennsylvania throughout. But some of the loudest voices on the left, perhaps most prominently the Democratic Socialists of America and related groups, are now pointing to that rhetoric to argue he should be disqualified from Harris’ consideration. And some are using that to claim Shapiro is not actually a progressive, pointing to issues like his support for school vouchers or suggesting that he was too pro-police as attorney general. Criticizing Shapiro about policy disagreements is fair, said Jewish Council for Public Affairs CEO Amy Spitalnick, but “when you are running a campaign around ‘Genocide Josh’ and he is the only potential candidate being labeled as such, that is singling out the Jewish candidate.” “I think it’s clear why. You’d be hard pressed to find any Jewish member of Congress that hasn’t on occasion faced a similar double standard,” said Adam Schiff, the California congressman and Senate candidate. “It’s offensive and wrong and I regret that Governor Shapiro has to endure this.” Even a “Case for Tim Walz for Vice President” document circulated by supporters – which a spokesman said is not connected to the Minnesota governor – makes an implicit reference to Shapiro’s perceived liability, arguing, “He has no known personal skeletons, major drawbacks or divisive stances that might depress Democratic base enthusiasm (eg. Israel/Gaza policy, charter schools, etc.)” Several Jewish Democratic operatives confided privately to CNN that though they think the attacks on Shapiro may be unfair and have at least tinges of antisemitism, they are anxious about him being the pick because of what putting him on the ticket could set off, from renewed protests at the Democratic convention later this month to larger splits in the party. But calling what’s coming at Shapiro “pure antisemitism,” Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, warned against that defensive way of thinking. “I strongly disagree with the notion that because bad actors would act badly that we should therefore avoid the possibility of those bad actors acting badly. That way lies madness,” Goldman said. “That’s how extortion happens — where the victims avoid what would be a confrontation with the bullies.” CNN’s Morgan Rimmer, Owen Dahlkamp and Haley Talbot contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

"‘There was no excitement. Now, there’s tons’: How Harris’ candidacy has energized plans for the DNC","‘There was no excitement. Now, there’s tons’: How Harris’ candidacy has energized plans for the DNC  In the moments after President Joe Biden pulled out of the 2024 race, a scramble unfolded as officials raced to reframe the Democratic National Convention around a new candidate: Vice President Kamala Harris. Officials quickly moved to tailor the Chicago convention to Harris with only four weeks, in part drawing from the 2008 convention when Barack Obama accepted the nomination given the historic candidacy of Harris herself. But the change — while abrupt — also presented an opportunity. Celebrities who had been uninterested in attending now showed renewed interest. Donors were energized. And a different tone for the convention began to take shape. “Before Biden decided not to run, it was going to be very anti-Trump, that was our best bet,” one source familiar with the planning told CNN. “Now, it’s going to be more positive and optimistic.” It’s a stark pivot from the state of play only a couple weeks ago, when celebrity endorsements and attendance were a tough sell. “There was no excitement. Now, there’s tons,” a Democratic strategist with deep Hollywood ties told CNN. “I’m getting hundreds of texts with people asking me to get them credentials.” In a little over a week, there’s been a groundswell of support for Harris, manifesting in millions of dollars of fundraising, multiple Zoom calls rallying voters, and a slew of endorsements from across the Democratic Party. She’s also already flexed some star power, including with a performance from Megan Thee Stallion at her Atlanta rally. Nominee acceptance speeches for the convention, which begins the week of August 19, are currently scheduled for that Wednesday and Thursday night, according to convention officials. Themes for each night of the convention are still being locked in and the schedule remains in flux. Conventional officials maintain that the general infrastructure hasn’t changed regardless of a change in who’s leading the party’s ticket. But sources described a convention geared toward reintroducing Harris, including setting up a lineup of people who know her best to deliver remarks. “The convention is our opportunity to tell our story directly to the American people, rally behind the Democratic nominees, and grow our broad and diverse coalition to defeat Donald Trump,” Democratic National Convention spokesperson Matt Hill said in a statement. “We look forward to sharing more soon about our convention in Chicago where Democrats will offer a forward-looking vision for our country that stands in stark contrast to the extremism from Donald Trump’s convention that would take America backwards.” The convention program if Biden were the nominee was expected to feature a sizable amount of pre-produced content, drawing from the televised storytelling during the virtual 2020 convention that some officials felt was effective in telling the party’s story. Some of that content is expected to remain. But now, as organizers prepare for a high-energy event and field input from new parties interested in participating, decisions must be made about what taped programming will end up on the cutting room floor, according to a source familiar with the planning. CNN previously reported that Biden — who was slated to close the convention as the nominee — is expected to deliver a primetime speech during the opening night of the Chicago convention, with the evening’s programming centering on Biden’s legacy and achievements. That programming will include highly produced televised content aimed at telling the story of how the country moved beyond the pandemic-era of four years ago, before literally and figuratively passing the baton to Biden’s onetime running mate. “Monday night is Joe’s night,” said a source familiar with the planning. “And then he’ll turn the keys over” to allow the event to focus on Harris. There’s history to such choreography. At the August 2000 convention, outgoing President Bill Clinton helmed the opening night keynote. After a camera crew filmed Clinton’s dramatic, three-minute entrance to the arena, he was welcomed to the lectern with an uproarious applause. Clinton used the opportunity to highlight the hallmarks of his almost eight years in office before officially passing the torch to his vice president, Al Gore. The Hollywood community is clamoring to support Harris at the DNC, according to numerous agents, publicists and Democratic strategists who spoke to CNN. There are so many celebrities interested in getting involved; the convention has become the hottest ticket in town. According to a source familiar with the DNC’s current plans, a handful of major Hollywood figures have been confirmed to attend. No performers have been set yet, though various representatives for musicians have been in talks with the Harris campaign, according to two sources. Plans are still being finalized. Aside from A-listers, Hollywood strategists told CNN that the type of celebrity who will appear at the convention will be very specific and strategic. For instance, besides Megan Thee Stallion’s performance at her Atlanta rally earlier this week, Harris had the support of the rapper Quavo, who spoke about gun violence prevention. Both stars appealed to Black voters and young voters. The young vote will be key, and, sources said, the Gen Z stars have expressed interest in appearing at the DNC. “The Republicans had Kid Rock and Hulk Hogan. It was just so yesterday,” a Democratic strategist told CNN. “Our story is about what’s next.” One of the considerations, according to a strategist in touch with the Harris campaign, is not going overboard with Hollywood players and making sure the focus remains on the issues. “It can’t look like an award show. That didn’t work for Hillary,” this strategist said, referencing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had an overwhelming level of celebrity support when she ran and lost to Trump in 2016. Even if they’re not in the room at the DNC, celebrities are expected to be in Chicago throughout the week and are already receiving invites to attend convention-related events and parties, according to an individual who is hosting an event. “They love the president and have so much respect for him, but there is clearly a different energy now,” according to a Hollywood executive who works with celebrities on political causes, referring to the apathy among celebrities last month. “There is a strong excitement about not only beating Trump, but also about the VP being the president. There is definitely energy on no Trump, but there is genuinely excitement in the context of the future,” this executive said. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Trump’s political operation says it raised nearly $139 million in July,"Trump’s political operation says it raised nearly $139 million in July  Donald Trump’s campaign said Thursday that its political operation raised $138.7 million in July for the former president’s election effort – and amassed $327 million in cash reserves for the roughly three-month sprint to the election. Trump’s total represents a jump from June, when the former president’s campaign and aligned committees reported bringing in nearly $112 million. But the July total was dwarfed by the fundraising haul of his newly minted Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, whose campaign said it raked in a whopping $310 million in its July fundraising efforts. Her campaign said it has $377 million cash on hand, marking the latest sign of how transformative and energizing the change to the top of the Democratic ticket has been among grassroots and high-dollar supporters. President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21 and endorsed Harris – reshaping the race for the White House just as it heads into its final stretch. In a short statement, the Trump campaign said that the total reflected “continued momentum with donors” and that the large stockpile of campaign dollars ensures Trump would have the resources to prevail on Election Day. Presidential campaigns will file the full details of their July fundraising and spending later this month. This story has been updated with additional developments. © 2024 Cable News Network.

"Tears, hugs and a salute as three freed Americans back on US soil after historic prisoner swap with Russia","Tears, hugs and a salute as three freed Americans back on US soil after historic prisoner swap with Russia  Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US Marine Paul Whelan and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva have landed in the United States, following the biggest prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since the Cold War. The returnees were greeted with tears and embraces by their joyous families at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were also on the tarmac to welcome them after their plane touched down some 20 minutes before midnight on Thursday. Whelan, who was first to exit the plane, gave a salute before shaking hands with the US leaders, followed by Gershkovich, who embraced both Harris and Biden before hugging his ecstatic parents. Kurmasheva rushed into the arms of her husband and daughters after greeting Harris and Biden. Gershkovich went quickly to address media gathered at the tarmac, telling his Wall Street Journal colleagues the words they had been waiting more than a year to hear. “I’m home,” he said. Biden observed the emotional family reunions, then removed his pin and placed it on Whelan’s lapel as Harris looked on. “It feels wonderful. Long time in coming. I was absolutely convinced we could get it done. I meant it when I said – alliances make a difference. They stepped up and took a chance for us and it mattered a lot,” Biden told reporters, referring to the extensive diplomatic effort that resulted in the swap. The return marks the conclusion of what Biden called a “brutal ordeal” for the three Americans and their families following their detentions in Russia, where prisoners are often kept in harrowing conditions. Whelan, 54, had spent almost six years in Russian prisons after his arrest in Moscow in December 2018, while Gershkovich, 32, had been detained for more than a year. Both were sentenced on espionage charges and declared wrongfully detained by the US State Department. Kurmasheva, a 47-year-old journalist for the US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was detained in October 2023 and found guilty of spreading false information about the Russian army – charges her family and employer deny. Their release – and that of Washington Post contributor and permanent US resident Vladimir Kara-Murza, 42 – was orchestrated as part of a complex prisoner swap between Russia, the US and other Western nations involving 24 detainees in total. Sixteen people were released from Russian custody on Thursday, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens who were political prisoners in their own country. Moscow in return got former high-ranking FSB colonel Vadim Krasikov, as well as several individuals accused of spying or cybercrime. The prisoner exchange marks a major diplomatic achievement and legacy-defining moment for Biden less than six months before he leaves office. In a statement earlier Thursday, Biden hailed the agreement as a “feat of diplomacy,” in collaboration with US allies, including Germany, Poland, Norway, Turkey and Slovenia. “Some of these women and men have been unjustly held for years. All have endured unimaginable suffering and uncertainty. Today, their agony is over,” said Biden, who hosted the families of Gershkovich, Whelan, Kurmasheva and Kara-Murza at the White House. Whelan, Gershkovich and Kurmasheva flew roughly 10 hours from Ankara, Turkey, on top of a three-hour-and-45-minute flight from Moscow to Ankara. They were accompanied on their return plane by multiple medics, a psychologist and US government officials including representatives from the National Security Council and State Department, a US official told CNN. A little less than two hours after touching down at Joint Base Andrews, the three Americans and some of their family members continued on to San Antonio where they landed early Friday morning. At Kelly Field, Whelan thanked US authorities for their efforts to bring him home and criticized Putin’s government for their “nonsense narrative” that accused him of espionage. “I’m never going back there again,” Whelan joked, referring to Russa. The three Americans will be taken to Brooke Army Medical Center to undergo medical evaluation and receive whatever care they need for as long as they need, the US official said. This is typical protocol for wrongfully detained Americans who return home. WNBA player Brittney Griner also went to the center right after she was released from Russian detention in December 2022. The returnees will also participate in a Defense Department program called PISA (Post Isolation Support Activities), which is meant to help them readjust to being back in the United States. Many recently freed US wrongful detainees have undergone this program to help them acclimate back to normal life. This story has been updated with additional developments.

JD Vance’s Republican colleagues defend Trump’s running mate saying Ohio senator is a voice for next generation of GOP voters,"JD Vance’s Republican colleagues defend Trump’s running mate saying Ohio senator is a voice for next generation of GOP voters  (CNN) — JD Vance’s Republican colleagues in the Senate say they’re largely sticking with the Ohio freshman – despite newly resurfaced comments facing criticism – warning that Vance represents where Republican see their voters moving. In the weeks since becoming Donald Trump’s chosen running mate, Vance has found himself caught in the middle of major test for a shifting Republican Party: Can a young lawmaker who represents the most populist voices in the party actually catapult Republicans to victory? Or are he and his message still a liability that could cost Trump the White House? Since he was tapped as Trump’s running mate, Vance’s stumbles and past statements – from attacks on “childless cat ladies” to proposing to raise taxes on those without children – have been billed as out of touch with the mainstream. His foreign policy positions are seen as on the fringe for old guard Republicans who have spent decades exposing the virtues of the United States’ role in the world. But most Republican senators have said they’re sticking with Vance. “There is value that comes from experience, but generations are changing. The way people look at the world and the things they know are different than the people who have been here longer,” GOP Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas said. “I think there is a time for turning the page.” Trump’s selection of Vance as his running mate set up the 40-year-old Ohio senator as the heir apparent to Trump’s brand of Republicanism that has transformed the Republican Party over the past eight years. For many in the Republican Party, Trump’s populist and isolationist impulses were often met with an eye-roll, especially during his first term when GOP lawmakers were constantly forced to comment on Trump’s latest policy stance issued via tweet. But Vance, who has been in the Senate fewer than two years, has fully embraced the populism mantle of the party, putting him at odds with many of his fellow senators -– including GOP Leader Mitch McConnell –- on issues like aid to Ukraine. “I have often said to him he is the intellectual conscience of the populist movement. In other words, he really does believe it. It’s not an opportunistic thing for him,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican. “He articulates it. He studies it. I like him because he is so communicative. Strong opinions but he also is quite eloquent. I don’t agree with him all the time – several things geopolitically – but I find him a pleasure to work with.” “He didn’t take his seat in the back of the class. That’s really clear,” Cramer said of Vance not really being a shrinking violet. Still, Vance’s stumbles since his selection and the wave of criticism over his past remarks have sparked questions – including from those inside the party – about whether his selection was the right one, especially since President Joe Biden’s dropping out has shaken up the campaign and jolted new energy into the Democratic base around Vice President Kamala Harris. “We are just hoping that Kamala Harris won’t pick someone reasonable,” said one GOP senator. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, when pushed on if Vance was the right choice, told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I’ve never been in a selection pool for VP, so I don’t necessarily – I’m not going to opine on that.” Pressed on whether Vance is a good candidate, Tillis replied, “I know JD well; I’ve gotten to know him pretty well over the past couple of years. I think he’s a smart guy. I think that … the Trump campaign picked him for a reason. I’m behind the ticket.” The ‘cat ladies’ comment comes back to haunt Vance As a Senate candidate in 2021, Vance said on Tucker Carlson’s former Fox News show that the country was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” The comments, which emerged not long after his selection as Trump’s running mate, have prompted criticism both from Hollywood celebrities as well as Republican senators. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is not supporting Trump’s bid, criticized Vance’s past comments as “offensive to me as a woman.” “Women make their own determinations as to whether or not they’re going to have children or cats or dogs or how many kids they’re going to have,” she told Raju. Even Vance allies have expressed caution about the remark. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said that Vance would make a “great vice president,” but also that he doesn’t believe Republicans should echo his now-infamous remarks. When asked by reporters Tuesday if Republicans should be mirroring Vance’s rhetoric around people who don’t have children, Hawley said, “No.” “It’s hard to have a family in America today, it’s really expensive. … So that’s what we ought to be talking about,” Hawley said. “I think we as a party should offer solutions to that.” Hawley is otherwise very supportive of Vance on the Republican ticket, saying he personally encouraged his long-time law school friend to run for the Senate years ago. A widening gulf in foreign policy For many GOP senators who have broken with Trump on his anti-NATO rhetoric, Vance’s most concerning stances deal with foreign policy, where Vance has been among the most vocal opponents of sending foreign aid to Ukraine. Vance fought against McConnell when Congress was considering a package of billions of dollars of military aid to Ukraine, which was eventually greenlit by House Speaker Mike Johnson and signed into law. During Trump’s first term, Trump’s foreign policy positions were often at odds with senior Republican senators, including the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona, former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and former Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee. But like the House, the Senate is now cast more in Trump’s mold, a transformation that’s included the election of Vance in 2022 on a campaign that included stopping military aid to Ukraine. “You’re going to see a divide among Republican senators. I think one difference is the Republican Senate in 2025 vs 2017 is going to to have a larger number of members who share President Trump’s worldview – or at least are amendable to his worldview, rather than just stridently opposed,” said Alexander Gray, who was chief of staff of the National Security Council under Trump. Gray said that Vance’s foreign policy worldview stems from his military service in Iraq and what he sees as the failures of American entanglements abroad. But he also noted that Vance supports an aggressive approach toward China and does not just want the US to retreat from the world stage altogether. “That worldview is about making hard choices with limited resources and devoting our resources to what is an existential threat with China,” Gray said. “He’s not for abdicating US global leadership; he’s not for stepping back from the US being a muscular power on the world stage.” GOP senators who back continued support to Ukraine privately say they’re hopeful that Vance might evolve as time goes on. There is a sense that as he learns more and becomes more aware of the fuller national security picture – connecting China and Iran and Russia – he will understand that the US can’t ignore Russian aggression and expect other enemies to not to respond in kind. “I don’t think anybody is going to have the option of being isolated to leave the rest of the world alone,” said one GOP senator who backs Ukraine. But Vance is hardly the only skeptic toward keeping up aid to Ukraine indefinitely inside the GOP Senate Conference, and it’s a fight that will likely play out early in a second Trump term should he win in November. Sen. Eric Schmitt, a fellow freshman from Missouri who is arguably the closest to Vance in the chamber, defended the Ohio senator, arguing that Vance was an effective spokesman for today’s Republican Party. “I think if you listen to our voters, they want the United States to be making decisions that are in the strategic best interest of the United States of America,” Schmitt said. “We can’t be everywhere all the time. I think the hubris of people advocating for a foreign policy of days gone by, we don’t have the capability to do all of those things. I don’t want to speak for him on that, but I think that is what he has talked about. He has not talked about withdrawing from the world.” Senators say they don’t have remorse Despite a series of missteps, multiple GOP senators say that Vance is learning and adapting as he goes. Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said he spoke to Trump about Vance before the vice presidential selection and it was Vance’s “energy” that attracted him to the Ohio Republican. “Energy is a big issue for him,” Mullin said of Trump. “He liked JD’s energy. He liked his way to carry a message and articulate (it). He liked that he was well known and came from a true American story completely opposite of (Trump’s) story so I think it was one of those things that he checked a lot of the boxes that Trump was looking for.” Mullin downplayed the significance of the comments that have come out of Vance’s history. “Trump had vetted him. He knew who he was, and it’s just an issue you gotta deal with everybody. Look, he’s 39 years old. I am 47. He grew up with more technology than I did,” Mullin said earlier this week, before Vance turned 40. “He grew up with more technology than I did, anybody who runs for office who is under 40, I think, is gonna have such a footprint of everything they said online. … Their personalities and their mindset changes as they get older and have kids.” Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican,  also defended Vance’s comments. “You know I have gotten in a couple of scrapes where you have to be careful how you say it. I have been here a good while and have had very few, but I know how that dynamic works,” Braun said. “I am certain that if we stick to the merits of the case, we’ll be able to overcome any of the other stuff that comes at us.” CNN’s Manu Raju contributed to this report.

House Freedom Caucus chair concedes Virginia primary to Trump-backed foe after recount,"House Freedom Caucus chair concedes Virginia primary to Trump-backed foe after recount  House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, who was targeted for defeat by former President Donald Trump, conceded the Republican primary in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District after a recount Thursday. “While I am disappointed in the ultimate outcome, it has been my distinct honor to serve as the congressional representative for Virginia’s 5th District over the past 3.5 years,” Good said in a statement on Facebook. Good requested the recount, which he had to fund, after the certified results of the June 18 primary found him 374 votes, or 0.6 percentage points, behind state Sen. John McGuire. With his defeat, Good becomes the third House member to lose a primary this year. In March, Rep. Jerry Carl lost an all-incumbent Republican primary in Alabama to Rep. Barry Moore in March after both ran for the same seat following redistricting. And in June, Democrat Jamaal Bowman, a member of the “squad” of progressive lawmakers, lost a primary for his New York City-area seat. The race for Virginia’s 5th District, which encompasses Charlottesville and parts of south-central Virginia, saw a fierce effort to oust Good from a broad swath of the GOP. Good lost Trump’s support after he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. And as one of the chief architects of the move to oust Kevin McCarthy as House speaker last fall, Good also drew the ire of McCarthy’s allies, who spent millions seeking revenge. The candidates and outside groups poured more than $14 million in ad spending into the race – the most expensive House Republican primary of the cycle to date. Groups opposing Good spent about $7.5 million, while those backing the incumbent spent $5.6 million on their efforts. One anti-Good ad painted him as disloyal to Trump and featured a clip of him criticizing the former president. Others targeted his votes against government funding bills. McGuire also narrowly outraised Good through May 29, federal records show, bringing in $1.2 million to his opponent’s $1.1 million. RELATED ARTICLE Trump’s comments about Harris’ race kicks off a new – yet familiar – chapter in the 2024 presidential campaign Good had to weather direct attacks from Trump, who held a tele-rally for McGuire on the eve of the election in which he attacked the incumbent for not being sufficiently supportive. “If he’s reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me,” Trump told supporters on the call. Good had sought to get back into Trump’s good graces once it became clear that the former president, and not DeSantis, would be the 2024 Republican nominee. He even appeared in New York City outside Trump’s hush money trial, along with other Republicans seeking to show their support and devotion to Trump. Both Good and McGuire rode in Trump’s motorcade on the way to the Manhattan courthouse. Despite those efforts, Trump declared on social media that Good was “BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA.” Trump’s campaign also sent the congressman’s team a cease-and-desist letter over signage that it said falsely implied that the former president had endorsed Good. Following the recount Thursday, McGuire said on social media that the exercise “reaffirmed what we already knew from the June 18th primary.” The state senator heads into the general election as the favorite against Democrat Gloria Witt in a district that Trump would have carried by 8 points in 2020 under the current lines.

Biden weighs more US defenses for Israel as the region prepares for Iranian retaliation,"Biden weighs more US defenses for Israel as the region prepares for Iranian retaliation  President Joe Biden is weighing more US defenses in the Middle East as the US prepares for an Iranian retaliation against Israel that officials say could include an attack on American forces. In a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday, Biden said the US would “support Israel’s defense against threats,” which would include “new defensive US military deployments,” according to a readout of the call. The statement did not detail what new deployments would occur ahead of an anticipated Iranian attack in response to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. According to several US officials, the Pentagon has discussed with US Central Command what adjustments to make to US force posture in the region, but no final decision had been made as of Thursday afternoon.  The officials said an Iranian response could occur in the coming days. The USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group, which includes the aircraft carrier, destroyers and other warships, has been operating in the Gulf of Oman in recent weeks. The strike group could potentially move into the Gulf of Aden or the Red Sea, where Navy warships have intercepted dozens of Houthi launches over the past several months. The USS Wasp amphibious assault ship and several other Navy vessels are currently operating in the Mediterranean Sea. The group includes a Marine expeditionary unit capable of carrying out an evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon if the US ordered such an evacuation. Biden said late Thursday night he is “very concerned” about escalating tensions in the Middle East. “We’re very concerned about it. I had a very direct meeting with (Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu) today. And – very direct. We have the basis for a ceasefire. He should move on it, and they should move on it now,” Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews. Asked whether the assassination of Haniyah impacted the chance of a ceasefire, he said it has “not helped.” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) promised a “harsh” and “painful” response to the assassination. Israel has not commented on the killing. The Iranian response to the killing of Haniyeh may include attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria from Iranian-backed proxy militias in the region, according to the officials. For months, the militias launched scores of attacks on US forces in the Middle East, but those largely subsided after a drone attack killed three US service members in Jordan in January. Officials say Iran could instruct those groups to start firing on US forces once again. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that “international partners” have bolstered their forces in the region, though he did not specify which countries. “We have very good defense systems,” he said of Israel’s own preparations for an attack, “and in addition we have international partners who have reinforced their forces [deployed] in the region, to help us counter the threats.” A Defense Department spokesman said Thursday the Pentagon has no information to provide on the movement of US forces or changes to force condition at this time. The US is expecting the anticipated Iranian attack may be similar to the barrage of ballistic missiles and drones launched against Israel on April 13, officials said. But this attack could be larger and more complicated than before, including the possibility of a coordinated attack with Iranian proxies from multiple directions. A coalition of countries, including Jordan and other Arab states, came together in April to share intelligence and intercept the Iranian barrage. But officials say it’s unclear if such a coalition could be stood up again so quickly and whether all of the countries are willing to participate once again. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hinted that a coordinated attack on Israel could be in the works after Israel assassinated one of its top commanders in Beirut less than 24 hours before the killing of Haniyeh. “Because they have picked a fight with everyone, they don’t know where the response will come from … the response will come separately or coordinated,” he said in a speech Thursday. The US still believes that no one in the region is interested in an all-out war engulfing the Middle East, officials say, but a potential miscalculation risks sparking a broader conflict.

Biden celebrates prisoner deal and importance of allies in key moment for his legacy,"Biden celebrates prisoner deal and importance of allies in key moment for his legacy  Thursday’s massive multi-country prisoner swap with Russia – touted by the US as the largest since the end of the Cold War – marked a major diplomatic achievement and legacy-defining moment for President Joe Biden less than six months before he leaves office. The prisoner exchange, which included Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan, was Biden’s first major foreign policy action since announcing last month he was ending his reelection bid and endorsing his Vice President Kamala Harris. The agreement involved months of complex negotiations with allies and adversaries alike, involving seven countries and 24 prisoners. Biden and Harris greeted Whelan, Gershkovich and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland late Thursday night after the freed Americans had touched down on US soil. Their families were also waiting on the tarmac to receive them. “I was absolutely convinced we could get it done,” Biden told reporters after watching the emotional family reunions. “I meant it when I said, ‘Alliances make a difference.’ They stepped up and took a chance for us, and it mattered a lot.” Flanked earlier in the day by the families of the prisoners who were released, Biden spoke from the White House and praised the US alliances that helped make the deal possible – an implicit knock of Donald Trump’s criticisms of NATO in a moment that injects a new dynamic into the presidential race between the former president and Harris. RELATED ARTICLE Russia releases Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan in historic prisoner swap with West “Anyone who questions if allies matter: They do,” Biden said, raising his voice. “They matter. Today is a powerful example of why it’s vital to have friends in this world. Friends you could trust, work with, and depend upon, especially in matters of great consequence and sensitivity like this.” Trump questioned the deal and what was given up in the exchange, calling the negotiators an “embarrassment.” “Are we releasing murderers, killers, or thugs? Just curious because we never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “They are extorting the United States of America. They’re calling the trade ‘complex’ – That’s so nobody can figure out how bad it is!” Trump said in an interview on “The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show” later Thursday, “They allowed some really rough people out.” The prisoner swap with Russia was just one of multiple foreign policy dilemmas that have vexed Biden’s presidency, from a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas to helping Ukraine keep up its fight against Russia. As he passed the baton to Harris last month, he said he would spend the last six months in office continuing to try to solve all of these issues. The president’s efforts to finalize the deal were ongoing even as he was preparing to drop out of the 2024 race. About an hour before Biden posted a letter making that announcement less than two weeks ago, for instance, he had been on the phone with his Slovenian counterpart to urge them to help push the deal over the finish line, according to a senior administration official. Biden also had multiple conversations about the deal with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz, including when the chancellor visited the Oval Office in February. Convicted Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov, who was jailed in Germany, was critical to getting Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a deal. Coming fewer than 100 days before Election Day, the prisoner swap is already playing into the 2024 campaign. Trump’s running mate suggested that the potential for the former president to return to office had prompted Putin to agree to the swap. RELATED ARTICLE Fact check: Trump, who approved multiple prisoner exchanges, falsely claims he gave up ‘nothing’ to get Americans back “We have to ask ourselves, why are they coming home? And I think it’s because bad guys all over the world recognize Donald Trump’s about to be back in office, so they’re cleaning house,” Ohio Sen. JD Vance said in an interview with CNN’s Steve Contorno on Thursday. “That’s a good thing, and I think it’s a testament to Donald Trump’s strength.” Trump had previously suggested that he was the only one who could get Putin to release Gershkovich. In a May Truth Social post, Trump wrote that the Wall Street Journal reporter “will be released almost immediately after the Election, but definitely before I assume Office.” “He will be HOME, SAFE, AND WITH HIS FAMILY. Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, will do that for me, but not for anyone else, and WE WILL BE PAYING NOTHING!” Trump said. As he finished his remarks Thursday, Biden was asked by reporters what he would say to Trump about his claims he could get the swap done without giving up anything. “Why didn’t he do it when he was president?” Biden said before turning to leave the room. While Gershkovich was imprisoned by Russia in 2023, Whelan has been in custody since 2018, when Trump was still in office. A White House official told CNN that Harris played a role in the diplomatic efforts to get Germany on board with the swap. When Harris attended the Munich Security Conference in February, she asked staff to leave the room while wrapping up a meeting with Scholz. Just one aide each for the vice president and the chancellor remained. It was in this private conversation that Harris emphasized that the release of Krasikov would be critical to a deal, a White House official told CNN. Harris pressed Scholz to facilitate the release of Krasikov, whom US officials have said was the “biggest fish” the Russians wanted. RELATED ARTICLE Who was freed in major prisoner swap between Russia and the West? “Today, in spite of all of their suffering, it gives me great comfort to know that their horrible ordeal is finally over,” Harris told reporters Thursday. “Over many years, President Biden and I and our team have engaged in complex, diplomatic negotiations to bring wrongfully detained Americans home. We never stopped fighting for their release.” The prisoner swap required making hard choices for Biden and the other countries involved, in what amounted to a release of dissidents held by Russia in exchange for criminals. The massive swap was the result of months of complicated behind-the-scenes negotiations involving the US, Russia and Germany and several other countries, ultimately leading Berlin to agree to release Moscow’s key demand of Krasikov. At least seven countries played a role in the expansive deal. A total of eight people, including Krasikov, were swapped back to Russia in exchange for the release of 16 people who were held in Russian detention, including four Americans. In addition to Whelan, Gershkovich and Kurmasheva, prominent Putin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a US permanent resident, was also freed. A senior administration official defended the release of Krasikov as part of the deal. “He was certainly the biggest fish that the Russians wanted back. Nobody’s turning a blind eye to his crimes and to his connection to Russian intelligence services. But look, in order to secure the release of innocent people overseas and innocent Americans, you have to make some tough decisions,” the official said.

Inside the ‘painstaking’ negotiations that led to the biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War,"Inside the ‘painstaking’ negotiations that led to the biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War  In late June, CIA officials held a secret meeting with Russian intelligence officers in an undisclosed Middle Eastern capital city to present a proposal for a possible prisoner swap. It was the latest in a series of offers US officials had made to Russia in a yearslong effort to secure the release of Americans imprisoned in Russia. But this time, the CIA had something new to offer: Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin who’d been convicted of executing a man in broad daylight in Berlin and was serving a life sentence in a German prison. The proposal the CIA offered to the Russians that day was the culmination of months of work by US officials to convince the Germans to release Krasikov, who’s seen as having close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The expansive deal presented that day included trading the Russian assassin for two high-profile Americans jailed in Russia on baseless charges of espionage: former US Marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. The Russian officials took the proposal back to Moscow. In early July, in a phone call with CIA Director Bill Burns, the Russian side indicated to the Americans that they agreed to the deal in principle, but the specifics still needed to be hammered out. Then on July 17, Moscow formally accepted the terms by transmitting their answer to the CIA, setting the stage for the largest prisoner exchange between the US and Russia since the Cold War, one that involved 24 prisoners and seven countries. It was a remarkably swift conclusion to years of painstaking negotiations between the US and more than half a dozen countries. It marked the end of a harrowing ordeal for Gershkovich, who just last month was sentenced to 16 years in prison after more than a year spent in jail, and for Whelan, who had been in Russian custody for nearly six years, many of them in a remote forced labor camp. The deal also brought home Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and freed prominent Putin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a US legal permanent resident. On Thursday, Gershkovich, Whelan and Kurmasheva stepped onto an American plane in Turkey bound for US soil, one of more than half a dozen planes on the crowded tarmac in Ankara that day – a testament to the unprecedented number of countries involved in the complex, monthslong negotiations. “The deal that made this possible was a feat of diplomacy and friendship,” President Joe Biden said in remarks from the White House on Thursday. “Multiple countries helped get this done. They joined difficult, complex negotiations at my request.” Late Thursday night, the freed Americans landed on US soil at Joint Base Andrews, where they were greeted by family members, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. This account is based on conversations with a dozen US officials who spoke of the intense efforts the Biden administration put into the negotiations – including navigating unexpected hurdles that at times threatened to derail the entire operation. Key to the deal was President Biden’s ability to persuade German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to release Krasikov, the Russian prisoner most keenly sought by Putin. When Krasikov was convicted of murdering a former Chechen fighter, the German court that convicted him said he acted on behalf of the Russian state, shooting his victim “execution style” in broad daylight. In December 2022, after the Russians refused to include Whelan in a prisoner swap that freed WNBA star Brittney Griner, officials across the interagency turned back to efforts to secure his release. They put forward another offer to Russia shortly after Griner’s release, according to a source familiar with the matter. But it was rejected. The Biden administration had for years sought Whelan’s release, and in January 2023, US intelligence officers met their Russian counterparts in an unnamed third country to offer a proposal to trade Whelan for two Russian nationals held in Slovenia. Russia rejected the offer then, and again in March of that year in a phone call with Burns. RELATED ARTICLE Biden celebrates prisoner deal and importance of allies in key moment for his legacy Then, the situation changed: In March 2023, Russian security forces arrested Gershkovich for espionage, the same charge levied against Whelan, which the US fiercely denied. Now, the Russians – who typically want parity in their swaps – wanted two high-value exchanges in return. The Biden administration had already traded its most valuable Russian prisoner, convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout, in return for Griner’s release. That left them with no high value Russian spies in custody, so officials began to scour the globe for Russian detainees, engaging in quiet diplomacy with allies to find others to make a deal. In November of that year, CIA officers in Moscow proposed an offer to swap four Russian prisoners held by Norway, Poland and Slovenia in exchange for Whelan and Gershkovich. But when Russia rejected the offer, it became clear to the US side that Russia wanted Krasikov. No one else would do. Now, the US government, working through intelligence channels, the State Department and the National Security Council, would have to convince the German government to swap him. There were more clandestine talks, held through a secretive CIA channel that the agency has worked through for years to conduct sensitive diplomacy with Moscow, some of which included the possible release of Russian dissident Alexey Navalny in exchange for Krasikov. Before the CIA could bring any serious proposal to the Russian side that involved Krasikov, the Biden administration had to get Germany to agree. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had learned through a top State Department official, James Rubin, who had talked with the Navalny team that there was reason to believe that Germany would agree to swapping Krasikov if there was a compelling moral imperative, said a senior State Department official. It was not a solution to the problem, but it impacted how the administration thought about getting Germany on board. At a G7 meeting in April 2023, Blinken raised the idea of offering up Krasikov with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. But she conveyed to Blinken her concern that Navalny would just return to Russia, among other objections, according to a US official familiar with the matter. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also repeatedly raised it on numerous occasions with his German counterpart. Officials worked quietly throughout this year to get the German government to agree to release Krasikov — including entreaties from both Biden and Harris. Biden raised the issue with Scholz in a January call and discussed it again with him in February during a meeting in the Oval Office. At that point, US officials felt that the deal had a good chance of coming together, according to an administration official. In the Oval Office meeting, according to a senior administration official, “Chancellor Scholz responded to the President, saying, ‘For you, I will do this.’” “The president then turned to Jake and said, ‘Get it done,’” the official said. After that February meeting, Sullivan was regularly passing lists to Berlin of possible Russians who could be swapped. The national security advisor in particular remained “optimistic,” according to another senior administration official. But then there was another blow: On February 16, 2024, Navalny died in a Russian prison. The US had been working to include Navalny in the deal. “Everything cooled,” after Navalny died, said one US official familiar with the talks. “At the time on that day, the team felt like the wind had been taken out of our sails in terms of efforts to get Paul and Evan back home,” a senior administration official told reporters on Thursday morning. Navalny’s death was made public in the opening hours of the Munich Security Conference in February, throwing everything into peril. Harris, who was in Germany for the conference, pressed Scholz to facilitate Krasikov’s release in a private meeting with the German chancellor. After she wrapped up a scheduled meeting with Scholz, she asked all staff to leave the room for what US officials sometimes refer to as a “restricted bilateral meeting,” where just one aide each for the vice president and the chancellor remained. In that intimate conversation, Harris emphasized that the release of Krasikov would be critical to a deal, a White House official told CNN. Back in Washington, on the day the US learned of Navalny’s death, Sullivan had a previously scheduled meeting in the afternoon with Gershkovich’s parents.  It prompted Sullivan to direct his team to start compiling lists of people who could still make a viable deal for Germany, a senior administration official and a second US official said. The list was finalized in late March, according to the US official. President Biden sent a letter to Scholz in April, and the Germans at last agreed to release Krasikov in early June. The key, according to multiple US officials, was the inclusion of Kara-Murza and seven other Russian political prisoners. It wasn’t only Germany that the US had to get on board. Still in Munich, Harris also asked for a meeting with Prime Minster Robert Golob of Slovenia. The main purpose of that meeting, a White House official said, was to press the prime minister on moving forward with the release of the two Russian nationals that were in Slovenian custody that the US had also identified as being a top priority for the Russians — the two that Russia had rejected on their own for the release of Whelan back in 2023. The official readout of that meeting, of course, made no mention of the two leaders discussing the prisoner swap. Biden was also pressing the Slovenes. As recently as two weekends ago, just moments before announcing that he would be ending his 2024 campaign, Biden called the Slovenian prime minister to urge him to get the deal across the finish line. It was only in recent weeks that Moscow agreed to the deal on the table. Once they gave their approval, things began to move quickly. Gershkovich’s trial – largely condemned as a sham – was expedited to July, with a quick conviction on the charges of espionage and a sentencing of 16 years in Russian prison. Kurmasheva’s trial was also quietly accelerated, and she was sentenced to 6.5 years in prison. In past prisoner swaps, the Russians had wanted convictions before they would move forward on any deal. In late July, in remarks at the Aspen Security Forum days after Gershkovich’s conviction, Sullivan was asked about efforts to free the Wall Street Journal reporter. RELATED VIDEO US official chokes up announcing deal to free Americans “All I can tell you is we are laser-focused on this; we are determined to make it happen. And I will consider it one of the most important things between now and the end of the year, and especially now at the end of the month, for us to try to get something done where we can get him home,” he said. As the end of July approached, the signals became even clearer. Pardons were issued for some of the individuals involved in the swap. The locations of other detainees were suddenly unknown. On July 26, Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens spoke with Paul Whelan by phone at his remote prison camp in Mordovia. Carstens was not able to tell him any details about the imminent swap, but he was able to get a sense of how Whelan was feeling, which was optimistic, a source familiar said. Jeff Flake, the US ambassador to Turkey, said there was a constant fear of the last several weeks that could spell the end of the deal, especially with so many moving parts to the exchange and so many people involved. “We just feared that some leak would spoil it,” Flake told CNN from Turkey. Flake says he was only brought in “a couple of weeks ago” as the exchange neared its final stages. “There were just very, very few that were aware of it,” he said. On August 1, all of the efforts came to fruition, as the historic deal played out. “Today was a very good day,” Sullivan said. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Appeals court narrows Voting Rights Act’s scope for redistricting cases in the South,"Appeals court narrows Voting Rights Act’s scope for redistricting cases in the South  The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed the scope of the Voting Rights Act for redistricting cases in a large swath of the South, ruling against the Justice Department and voters of color who had challenged Galveston, Texas’s county commission map for how it been redrawn to dismantle a district where minorities made up a majority of the population. The conservative appeals court on Thursday reversed its previous precedent that allowed multiple minority groups to join together in challenges to redistricting plans alleged to be discriminatory under the VRA. Circuit Judge Edith Jones, a Reagan appointee, wrote in the majority opinion that so-called coalition districts are “inconsistent with the text” of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the question of coalition districts and the Voting Rights Act. Other circuit courts have disagreed over whether the landmark civil rights law contemplated such legal challenges by multi-racial coalitions. Jones wrote that the VRA “has accomplished its original purposes with great success” and asserted that Thursday’s ruling “has accomplished its original purposes with great success.” In the Galveston case, the county was accused of violating the Voting Rights Act by breaking up a commission district that had grouped together Black and Hispanic communities, which together make up 39% of the county’s population and largely support Democrats. Under the disputed plan, White people – who overwhelming support Republicans in Galveston – now are the majority in all four commission districts. The trial judge, a Trump appointee, had struck down the redrawn map in a scathing opinion that said that the county’s “obliteration” of the majority-minority district was “stark,” “jarring,” “egregious” and “mean-spirited.” The case will return to the trial court for more proceedings examining whether the map was redrawn with the intent to discriminate against Black and Hispanic voters. Christian Adams, a lawyer for the county, called the new ruling a “great win for the rule of law and the Constitution.” A lawyer for the voters who challenged the map said that they were “disappointed with this decision, which not only ignores decades of legal precedent but also the language of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.” “We’re considering next steps at this time,” the lawyer, Valencia Richardson of Campaign Legal Center, said. The Justice Department did not immediately provide comment. Coalition district claims are not commonly brought, voting rights experts have told CNN, because such challenges must meet particular, fact-specific circumstances to be successful. However, they said that the now-reversed precedent had a prophylactic effect by discouraging map drawers from breaking up coalition districts. The 5th Circuit’s new ruling will apply to Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi – all states where map-drawers were required to get federal approval for redistricting plans until a 2013 Supreme Court ruling gutted what was known as the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act. A dissent to the 5th Circuit’s Thursday ruling written by Biden-appointed Circuit Judge Dana Douglas and joined by all the Democratic-appointees on the court said that “the majority finally dismantled the effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act in this circuit, leaving four decades of en banc precedent flattened in its wake.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

Panel recommends Trump ally Jeffrey Clark’s law license be suspended over his role in efforts to overturn 2020 election,"Panel recommends Trump ally Jeffrey Clark’s law license be suspended over his role in efforts to overturn 2020 election  Jeffrey Clark, the Trump-era Justice Department official who advocated for the department to contact Georgia and cast doubt on Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss, should face a two-year suspension from practicing law, a disciplinary committee in Washington, DC, said Thursday. As an environmental lawyer at the Justice Department, Clark tried to push through an official letter to officials in Georgia after the 2020 election, urging the state to interfere with the election results. His superiors at the Justice Department told him no. The disciplinary committee found Clark included false and misleading information in the letter. “What Mr. Clark did was objectively reckless, but subjectively, the evidence indicated that he thought he had been chosen for a historic cause, to which he applied all of his energies,” the three-person hearing committee wrote in its findings. Clark maintained he believed he could send the letter to Georgia, and even took the stand in his own defense at the disciplinary trial. Then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Deputy Attorney General Richard Donohue also testified in Clark’s proceeding, saying the Justice Department didn’t find significant fraud in the elections even while Clark insisted it might. “His sincerity of belief does not make him less reckless,” the committee wrote in its findings. “To the contrary, we conclude that his personal beliefs blinded him from objectively assessing the facts and the reality of his proposed course of action, and caused him to rationalize a broader role for the Department of Justice, failing to distinguish President Trump from candidate Trump.” The disciplinary counsel that brought the case against Clark sought for him to face a severe sanction like disbarment, while Clark’s team wanted him to avoid being disciplined. The recommendation — laid out in a 213-page report after a quasi-trial proceeding — is an early step in the process of attorney discipline. If the recommendation is adopted, Clark would face less fallout than two other attorneys who may be disbarred for their work for Trump: John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani. The hearing committee wrote in its report that it doesn’t believe there was “clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Clark was as culpable” as those two, who worked privately for Trump after the election. “We cannot recommend sanctioning Mr. Clark from what might be true or what evidence was presented in other cases. We can only recommend sanctioning him for what has been proven in this case by clear and convincing evidence,” the report said. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Trump wants to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Here’s what that could mean for seniors,"Trump wants to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Here’s what that could mean for seniors  A few weeks after promising to eliminate taxes on tips, former President Donald Trump has unveiled a second proposal for targeted tax relief. The beneficiaries this time would be senior citizens, an influential voting bloc. “SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump posted Wednesday on Truth Social. While lifting the levy would benefit many older Americans for a little while, the proposal would harm the popular entitlement program, as well as Medicare and the federal budget, if Trump and Congress don’t come up with a way to replace the lost revenue, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. What’s more, many seniors could ultimately be hurt if Social Security and Medicare’s trust funds run dry sooner and benefits have to be cut. “Certainly, seniors would enjoy it for several years,” Goldwein said, noting Trump’s proposal would benefit higher-earning older Americans more. “But it hastens the insolvency of Social Security and Medicare, and it increases the size of the across-the-board cut.” In an interview that aired Sunday, Trump reiterated his promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits but did not specify how he would pay for the proposal. When Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo asked how he would offset the lost revenue, Trump said he would focus on eliminating “waste” and “fat” in the federal government – but did not say what he would cut. The highest-income households would be the biggest winners in dollar terms, but middle class and upper-middle income taxpayers would get the largest boost in their after-tax income, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. Lower-income households would get little to no benefit. Social Security benefits began being taxed in 1984 as part of the last major federal overhaul to shore up the program’s finances. Any changes to tax law would need to go through Congress. Currently, seniors don’t owe taxes on their benefits if they earn less than $25,000 per individual, or $32,000 for married couples, of so-called combined income, which takes into account their adjusted gross income, half their Social Security benefits and nontaxable interest. Above that threshold, they may have to pay income tax on up to 50% of their benefits, with the revenue going to the Social Security retirement trust fund. Those with combined incomes of at least $34,000 per individual, or $44,000 per couple, could pay income tax on up to an additional 35% of their benefits, with those funds going to Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund, known as Medicare Part A. The tax on Social Security benefits is not a huge revenue generator for the Social Security trust fund, though its contribution has been growing since monthly benefits generally increase each year – particularly in recent years when inflation has been high. But the threshold is not indexed for inflation. This year, the levy is expected to raise about $94 billion, according to the committee. The top 0.1% of households, with incomes of nearly $5 million or more, would get an average tax cut of almost $2,500 next year, though that wouldn’t make a dent in their after-tax income, according to the Tax Policy Center. At the other end of the income ladder, those earning less than roughly $33,000 would see no change and those with incomes between that amount and $63,000 would get an average tax cut of around $90, or 0.2% of their after-tax income. But those making between roughly $63,000 and $113,000 would see an average boost in after tax-income of 0.8%, or $630, while those earning between $113,000 and about $206,000 would see an average increase of 0.9%, or roughly $1,200. Eliminating the tax would increase federal deficits by between $1.6 trillion and $1.8 trillion through 2035, a committee analysis found. The Social Security retirement trust fund would be depleted more than a year earlier, and Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund, which covers in-patient hospital care, hospice care, short-term skilled nursing facility services and home health services following hospitalizations, would run dry six years earlier. Currently, Social Security’s retirement trust fund is expected to be exhausted in 2033, after which it would only be able to pay 79% of benefits owed, according to the program’s most recent trustees report. Medicare would only be able to pay 89% of total scheduled Part A benefits starting in 2036, according to the most recent report from its trustees. Once Social Security’s trust fund runs dry, seniors whose benefits cuts are larger than their tax savings would lose out, Goldwein said. Lowest-income senior citizens would be hurt the most. To be sure, the tax on Social Security benefits is a burden for many seniors. Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said he frequently hears people complain about the levy at town halls. But he doesn’t agree with eliminating the tax because it will hurt the program’s finances. “It’s a ploy,” Richtman said, noting that he’d prefer the income threshold be raised and adjusted for inflation, which is part of the Social Security 2100 Act sponsored by Rep. John Larson, a Democrat from Connecticut. The legislation has not progressed in the House. In June, Trump proposed eliminating taxes on tips at a campaign rally in Nevada, a critical swing state with many service industry workers. He has repeated the pledge in rallies since then. The measure would help only a small share of workers. About 4 million people worked in tipped occupations in 2023, or about 2.5% of all employment, according to a recent analysis by Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Biden administration. Even among workers at the bottom of the income ladder, making less than $17.66 an hour, only 5% are in tipped jobs. And it would have no impact on more than a third of tipped workers because their incomes were so low that they faced no federal income tax in 2022, according to the analysis. Plus, the proposal could reduce federal revenue by at least $107 billion because more businesses and employees may shift from wages to tips, according to the Tax Foundation.

"Rajasthan tribal MP: ‘SC verdict will break unity among Dalits, Adivasis … if there is a big attack on quota in future, people won’t be able to resist’","Rajasthan tribal MP: ‘SC verdict will break unity among Dalits, Adivasis … if there is a big attack on quota in future, people won’t be able to resist’  Following the landmark Supreme Court judgment allowing sub-classification of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), Rajasthan’s INDIA alliance constituent Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) has announced its opposition to it. The party’s founder and Lok Sabha MP Rajkumar Roat, says sub-classification will lead to division within the SC-ST communities. Roat speaks to The Indian Express about why he thinks sub-categorisation will be divisive. Excerpts: * What is your take on the Supreme Court judgment? The situation of the SC-ST communities is different in every state. The manner in which this judgment was delivered, it (sub-categorisation) will serve to break up the unity among SCs and STs. If there is inequality in our state among STs, then our people, social organisations, MPs, and MLAs can sit together, decide, and submit a proposal to the government on what needs to be done. However, this SC judgment will break the unity among tribals and SCs. * Did any Rajasthan ST group demand sub-categorisation? There hasn’t been any such demand. In Rajasthan, there is indeed discussion on scheduled and non-scheduled areas when it comes to (jobs in) state services. But that can be resolved on the basis of the concerned areas, not by dividing the community. If you target the community then it will lead to conflict and that is what they (the BJP-led Centre) want. They are saying that they will give jobs to the weaker sections but how will they be identified? How will the government identify? * They also favour removing quotas for the creamy layer … Reservation has not been given for backwardness. The STs fought all the aggressors and it has been given based on their social identity. But the way they are defining it now (based on economic status) is incorrect. If this continues, reservation will be over in times to come. * What is your party’s position on the judgment? Our stand is that it has been brought for a particular community to fight within itself, which is wrong. We don’t support it. People in some remote areas haven’t yet received the benefit of reservation. Because of such cases, there can be a division of (existing reservation in) state services, between Schedule 5 and non-Schedule 5 areas, on the basis of population. Rather than target and divide communities, the division can be on the basis of the area. * It is said that some Rajasthan ST groups have received more reservation benefits than others… We do agree that this is true, but in Rajasthan, it can be addressed on a social level by the social and political leaders of the community. We will send such a proposal (to the state government). The government cannot identify that (because of political compulsions) but we can. * How do you see the judgment play out in the state? It will lead to divisions within SCs and STs and if there is a big attack on reservation in the future, then there may not be any struggle as the people won’t be able to resist it unitedly.

"Not cast in stone: Naidu govt mulls over removing Jagan images from boundary markers, passbooks","Not cast in stone: Naidu govt mulls over removing Jagan images from boundary markers, passbooks  During the recently concluded Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, the state Land Titling Act became a flashpoint between the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), with the former claiming that the system before the Land Tilling Act came into effect led to land encroachment under the previous regime and the TDP accusing the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led party of using the Act to grab land and property without the proper documents. After the N Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP alliance came to power, the new state government fulfilled its poll promise and repealed the Land Titling Act on July 24. Now, the Naidu government is contemplating removing Jagan Mohan Reddy’s photographs from the land boundary marker stones that were fixed during land surveys and from lakhs of land ownership passbooks issued as part of the Act. Naidu told the Assembly this week that the government would reissue the pattadar passbooks with only the official state seal. “The Jagan government wasted Rs 15 crore for printing his photos on the passbooks. The state government, as promised during the electioneering and as per the demand of the people, has decided to issue passbooks with the official seal. Officers have already submitted a copy of the passbook carrying the official seal,” said the CM. However, the TDP government is at a loss over what to do with approximately 77 lakh boundary stones with Jagan’s photo carved on them that revenue officials had planted. After the TDP stormed back to power, many farmers and landowners ripped out the stones, mostly because they disputed the land markings. The TDP’s Revenue Minister Anagani Satya Prasad claimed over 80% of land and property owners were unhappy with the YSRCP surveys and had initiated litigation. “We will be holding ‘gram sabhas’ in over 7,000 villages to ascertain if the land had been marked properly or not, and in consultations with the villagers, will conduct a resurvey if necessary and mark the boundaries accordingly,” he added. TDP ministers also alleged the Jagan government spent over Rs 600 crore to procure the boundary stones and carve the former CM’s image on them. “Though the Centre has never mentioned the issue of laying stones in the directions for the survey, Jagan prepared granite stones only for carving his pictures,” Satya Prasad said. Officials said that the exercise to re-issue land title passbooks without Jagan’s photograph, and the removal of the boundary stones with Jagan’s carving might cost up to Rs 15 crore. “The lakhs of granite stones that will be removed will be used for other purposes,” an official said. YSRCP spokesperson and former minister Ambati Rambabu accused the TDP and Naidu of levelling false allegations. “The land survey was done very scientifically and involved technology that ensured very precise marking of lands. The TDP had originally supported the YSRCP’s land survey but made a U-turn and opposed it. Even now, they are backtracking from their opposition by saying that they will conduct a re-survey, which means it will be a continuation of what the YSRCP government started,” he said. In October 2020, after the NITI Aayog, the Centre’s policy think tank, recommended the implementation of the Land Titling Act in all states, Andhra Pradesh became one of the first states to conduct land surveys to implement it. As per the now-repealed Act, all land and immovable property must be compulsorily registered with government agencies that will then issue permanent titles for them. The Act also provided a new system for speedy property dispute resolution by establishing tribunals. After the Act was rolled out, several property owners raised objections to the method of surveying lands using drones and geotagging, which resulted in discrepancies and disputes. During the election campaign, Naidu and ally JanaSena Party chief K Pawan Kalyan alleged that the YSRCP wanted to usurp land under the Act. In his public meetings, Naidu said the process of land surveys was full of discrepancies and that the people involved were not technically qualified to conduct such surveys.

"Wayanad tragedy: How different parties, governments, states ensure reports on Western Ghats stay buried","Wayanad tragedy: How different parties, governments, states ensure reports on Western Ghats stay buried  The Wayanad landslide disaster where the toll has crossed 200, with around 300 people still missing, has drawn the issue of pending protection for the ecologically fragile Western Ghats into the spotlight again. It has been 13 years since an expert panel led by ecologist Madhav Gadgil submitted its report, recommending designating the entire Ghats region as an ecologically sensitive zone (ESZ), a graded zonation approach to regulating activities, and creation of an overarching ecological authority for the region. The landmark report was met with political protests and demands to shrink the ESZ areas for industries and other development activities. These also ensured that the recommendations of the K Kasturirangan-led expert panel — which was formed to review the Gadgil report — have also remained on paper. As it stands today, a draft notification of the Centre, demarcating nearly 60,000 sq km of the Ghats as an ecologically sensitive area (ESA), on the prescription of the Kasturirangan panel, continues to be in limbo. While the Gadgil panel had recommended broad ESZs, the Kasturirangan committee proposed ESAs, with one village categorised as one unit of ESA. Of this 60,000 sq km area, 449 sq km falls in Gujarat, 17,340 sq km in Maharashtra, 1,461 sq km in Goa, 20,668 sq km in Karnataka, and 6,914 sq km in Tamil Nadu. Kerala did its own ground-truthing exercise in response to the Kasturirangan report and declared 9,993.7 sq km as ESA. However, the Centre has been unable to achieve a political consensus on the area to be notified as ESA. Moreover, another committee, headed by Sanjay Kumar, former Director General of Forests, Environment Ministry, is now examining the issue. Opposition by states Both the Gadgil and Kasturirangan panel reports have been opposed by successive governments in Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat – irrespective of the parties in power. Their opposition has broadly been based on the apprehension that the hard lines drawn to prohibit certain activities and the demarcation of whole villages as ESAs will deprive them of economic growth opportunities. State governments have also carried out independent ground-truthing exercises in response to the ESA demarcation proposed by the Kasturirangan panel. For instance, during a review of the Gadgil report in 2013, the Congress-led UDF government in Kerala submitted to the Kasturirangan panel that the state’s foreign exchange would be affected if large parts of Wayanad and Idukki districts were demarcated as ESA, as these had agricultural areas where cash crops were grown. The then state Finance Minister, K M Mani, also said in the submission that if the Gadgil report was implemented, “normal agricultural and human activities would become impossible”. The same year, in November, protests against implementing the Kasturirangan report turned violent in the hilly regions of north Kerala’s Kozhikode and Kannur districts after the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) issued orders prohibiting quarrying, mining, and red category of industries in ecologically sensitive zones. Then Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said the state government would not allow implementation of the report’s recommendations in a “manner affecting life” and called for a “more practical approach”. In January 2014, the Kerala Assembly unanimously passed a resolution asking the Centre to exempt populated, agricultural, and plantation areas from the ambit of ecologically fragile land. Both the Kasturirangan panel and a three-member expert committee formed by the Kerala government in 2013 had recommended that the Meppadi panchayat in Wayanad, the site of Tuesday’s landslide, be included in the larger eco-sensitive zone being demarcated in the state. However, the recommendations were not implemented. Maharashtra’s Congress-NCP government submitted to the Union Environment Ministry in 2012 — the Congress was in power at the Centre too at the time — that the creation of an overarching Western Ghats Ecological Authority would run parallel to existing government agencies, and opposed the idea. Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu also opposed the embargo proposed on new hydropower projects. The stand of Karnataka, with largest sensitive area In its official response to the Kasturirangan report in 2015, the then Congress government in Karnataka said that an expert committee set up by it had concluded that only 153, and not 1,553, villages in the state be declared ESAs. The Karnataka government also called for permission for ecotourism in the protected areas, expansion of existing power plants, and stone quarrying and sand mining, saying this was needed for local development needs. Too many restrictions “in the absence of larger public appreciation and support… will defeat the very purpose of conserving ecology and environment in the Western Ghats”, the state said. However, it said, mining could be barred. In 2022, when the BJP government at the Centre proposed the notification of ESAs in the Western Ghats, then Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai of the BJP took a delegation of MLAs and MPs from the Western Ghats — predominantly from the BJP at the time — to meet Environment Minister Bhupendra Yadav to dissuade him. Then Karnataka Home Minister Araga Jnanendra said if the draft notification was accepted as it was, “it will affect the lives of people in rural areas”. How things stand Senior environmentalist V S Vijayan, who was a member of the Gadgil panel, told The Indian Express that both the UPA and NDA governments should have done more to communicate the intent of their committee. Instead, a narrative took hold that their recommendations were “anti-people”, Vijayan said. “I still stand by our recommendations and the government should revisit our report. I believe that if our recommendations were followed, incidents like the Wayanad disaster could have been averted,” he said. Pandurang Hegde, an environmental activist associated with the Save Western Ghats Movement in Karnataka, the state with the largest ESA cover in the Ghats region, said that irrespective of which political party is in power, they have always projected protection of Western Ghats as an “anti-people issue”. “Madhav Gadgil always said that let the people decide on the zonation. Those with vested interests desiring to exploit natural resources do not want the demarcation of ESAs and politicians have used local people as a shield to justify the delays,” Hegde said. On Friday, in the wake of rain damage in the Kodagu area of Karnataka, which falls in the Western Ghats region, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah said the state had reconsidered the Kasturirangan report but again come to the conclusion that it was “not beneficial to people” of the state. This was after a suggestion by the Congress government’s Environment and Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre that the state would adopt the Kasturirangan report’s recommendations. Khandre later clarified that he had never said the state was “bound to implement” the report. — With inputs from Johnson T A Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates Sheikh Hasina gone, her party leaders in hiding         An award-winning journalist with 14 years of experience, Nikhil Ghanekar is an Assistant Editor with the National Bureau [Government] of The Indian Express in New Delhi.

"Mamata, movies, politics: How Bengal CM again displayed her hold over Tollywood","Mamata, movies, politics: How Bengal CM again displayed her hold over Tollywood  The Bengali film industry has been an enthusiastic supporter of Mamata Banerjee since her rise to power over a decade ago and recently the West Bengal Chief Minister displayed the hold she continues to have over Tollywood as the industry is popularly known. Banerjee recently intervened to resolve a stalemate between directors and technicians over the boycott of the shoots of director Rahool Mukherjee. On July 30, actors Prosenjit Chatterjee and Dev along with filmmaker Goutam Ghose met Banerjee in an attempt to resolve the deadlock as studios remained closed and several shooting projects remained on hold after technicians refused to work on a film Mukherjee is directing. The director is currently facing a three-month ban imposed by the Federation of Cine Technicians’ Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) for allegedly violating the industry’s norms by employing Bangladeshi technicians on a previous project. The stand-off escalated last Saturday when technicians walked off the set of Mukherjee’s new film, leading to a show of solidarity from other directors who ceased work on Monday in protest. The industry remained divided, with prominent figures such as Prosenjit and Anirban Bhattacharya supporting Mukherjee, while technicians stuck to their positions. However, soon after the meeting between the industry veterans and the CM, the standoff was resolved and shooting in Tollygunge’s studios resumed on Wednesday. Both Chatterjee and Dev, who is a Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP, expressed gratitude to Banerjee for her support and expressed confidence about a swift resolution of the issue. Time and again, Banerjee and her party have swayed the Bengali film industry by making legislators out of film stars while rewarding many film personalities with awards. Sources said Banerjee knows very well that being surrounded by celebrities fetches her party easy votes. “The trend of celebrities joining political parties and getting involved in active politics exists across the country. This is no different. Mamata Banerjee cares for film personalities and wants to further develop the industry. The state government has always given them priority. Therefore, she has nothing but the best interest of the film industry in mind,” said a TMC insider. Bengali film and television stars dominate the stage of most state-sponsored cultural events, because Banerjee promotes them, inviting them to attend her party meetings and rallies and using their star quotient for political purposes. Over the years, the TMC’s annual Martyrs’ Day rally in Kolkata on July 21 has become a star-studded affair, with Bengali film stars occupying front-row seats on stage. Ahead of this year’s Lok Sabha polls, Banerjee appeared in the popular Bengali TV show “Didi No 1” as part of her outreach campaign. Its host Rachana Banerjee is the current TMC MP from Hooghly. Not just Rachana or Dev, Mamata over the years has handpicked actors and actresses to win crucial seats in Lok Sabha and Assembly elections — from established actors such as Tapas Pal, Shatabdi Roy, Debashree Roy, Moon Moon Sen and Chiranjeet, to stars from the younger generation such as Dev, Mimi Chakraborty, Nusrat Jahan, and singer Aditi Munshi. The trend has continued in recent years with more celebrities such as director Raj Chakraborty, actors Soham Chakraborty, Sayantika Banerjee, Saayoni Ghosh, June Maliah, and Kanchan Mullick joining the party and winning elections; not to mention her roping in of heavyweights such as Shatrughan Sinha and Babul Supriyo from the BJP. Apart from political positions, The TMC government has also bestowed honours on industry names who are close to it. Since 2012, the Mamata government has been conferring the Mahanayak Samman and other awards to Bengali film and television personalities “for outstanding contributions in the world of cinema”. This year, the CM has conferred the Mahanayak Samman on Bengali Rachana Banerjee and singer Nachiketa Chakraborty. Prosenjit Chatterjee was given a special award for his contribution to the Bengali film industry over the last four decades. Actors Subhasis Mukherjee, Ambarish Bhattacharya, and Rukmini Moitra received special awards.

"Karnataka vs Centre rice battle: FCI now allows states to procure, Congress hits out at ‘delay’","Karnataka vs Centre rice battle: FCI now allows states to procure, Congress hits out at ‘delay’  A YEAR after prohibiting states from doing so, Union Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Minister Pralhad Joshi on Thursday announced that states can now directly purchase rice from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the Open Market Sale Scheme (Domestic) without participating in the e-auction. Under this, states can buy rice for Rs 2,800 per quintal (excluding the cost of transportation). This will come as a relief especially for Congress-ruled Karnataka, which has been at loggerheads with the Centre over rice procurement for its Anna Bhagya scheme. Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh hit out at the Centre for the reversal now, saying the “irrational policy (of stopping states from procuring rice) was undertaken with the sole intention of disrupting the Karnataka government’s Anna Bhagya Scheme”. A poll promise by the Congress, which dislodged the BJP from power in Karnataka, the scheme doubled the quota of rice available to each individual entitled to grains under the National Food Security Act, from 5 kg to 10 kg per month. Ramesh said that “the vendetta-driven decision had not only deprived the people of Karnataka of an additional five kilograms of rice through the Anna Bhagya Guarantee, but also increased India’s food subsidy bill by tens of thousands of crores”. Why Karnataka wanted the rice JUST DAYS ahead of the rollout of the Anna Bhagya Scheme by the newly elected Congress government in Karnataka, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Food Distribution announced in June last year that state governments could no longer acquire rice via the open market scheme of the FCI. The Centre justified the move as anti-inflationary, “to maintain sufficient stocks for market intervention / control (of) prices of wheat and rice”. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, however, said the decision was meant to specifically stymie his government, which was banking on FCI supply to meet its Anna Bhagya promise. The scheme had been one of the Congress’s “five guarantees” to voters in its manifesto, which are believed to have gone a long way in helping the party win the 2023 elections, and the party claimed that the BJP was trying to get back at it. As per Karnataka’s estimates, it needed 2.28 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of rice to facilitate 5 kg of free rice per member per BPL family over the next one year, apart from what was given under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The Karnataka scheme had identified 1.19 crore BPL card holding families for Anna Bhagya. The Central scheme recognises 96.19 lakh regular BPL card holder families, plus 10.36 lakh state BPL card holders as NFSA beneficiaries – making a total of 1.06 crore family beneficiaries. The Siddaramaiah government had therefore budgeted for Rs 890 crore per month as its expenditure for the scheme, hoping to source rice from the FCI at Rs 34 per kg (including Rs 2.60 per kg for transportation). After the Centre stopped this, the Siddaramaiah government had to resort to handing out cash amounting to Rs 170 per person to make up for the rice shortfall. These funds were deposited into the bank accounts of BPL family heads. Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates",True,True,True
Today in Politics: Karnataka BJP begins march against ‘corrupt’ Siddaramaiah govt; AAP-LG reach yet another flashpoint,"Today in Politics: Karnataka BJP begins march against ‘corrupt’ Siddaramaiah govt; AAP-LG reach yet another flashpoint  The BJP is going all out in its bid to corner the Siddaramaiah government in Karnataka. On Friday, BJP Karnataka president BY Vijayendra said the party was starting a seven-day padayatra (foot march) from Bengaluru to Mysuru on Saturday to take the fight against the Congress government to its “logical end”. The BJP has organised the march to raise further heat on Siddaramiah over the alleged Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) scam. The BJP has alleged that the CM’s wife Parvati was “illegally” benefitting from MUDA after the agency encroached on a parcel of land owned by her to create layouts. The BJP has also claimed that there was an irregularity in the purchase of land by her brother and also in the compensatory sites allotted by MUDA in exchange for the land. On July 26, Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot sent a show cause notice to Siddaramaiah on the scam. The Karnataka Council of Ministers on Thursday discussed the show cause notice. They alleged that it was a “gross misuse of the Constitutional Office’ of the Governor and said that a concerted effort was “being made to destabilise a lawfully elected majority government in Karnataka for political considerations”. While the BJP will use the march to hit out at the Congress government, there is a particular absence from the march that is causing the BJP discontent. Its ally in Karnataka, the Janata Dal (Secular), has publicly pulled out of the march. On Wednesday, JD(S) leader and Union minister HD Kumaraswamy declared that the party would not be part of the march, saying that many JD(S) leaders were not in favour of it at a time when people were battling rain-related issues. He also went on to accuse the BJP of “sidelining” the JD(S). Speaking to reporters in Delhi, the Union minister said: “In the region between Bengaluru and Mysuru, we (the JD-S) are strong. In this situation, if they do not take us into confidence in a proper manner, why should we support (the march)? The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Lieutenant Governor’s office in Delhi have reached yet another flashpoint. This time, the sparring occurred over the deaths of a woman and her child in East Delhi who had fallen into a drain after a downpour on Wednesday evening. On Friday, AAP leaders alleged that the drain was under the purview of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and demanded the resignation of the LG, who is the chairman of the Authority. The AAP has also announced a protest at the LG office on Saturday. The LG’s office shot back a letter in which it hit out at AAP leaders and said the drain was under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), which is under the Delhi government. “While this is undoubtedly another example of abuse typical of the AAP and its leadership, the fact of the matter is that the drain in which the unfortunate incident of drowning happened at Khoda colony belonged to the MCD under the control of AAP,” said the LG office. The 100-metre drain was neither desilted nor covered, it claimed. “AAP MP Sanjay Singh, MLA Kuldeep Kumar, party spokesperson Priyankar Kakkar and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), yesterday issued a patently false, deliberately misleading and blatantly improper statement holding the DDA responsible for the tragic death of a lady and her child by drowning and demanded the Hon’ble LG’s resignation. The same set of lies were again peddled today in a press conference by minister Gopal Rai and MLA Kuldeep Kumar,” the letter said. In a scathing attack on the AAP government, the LG office charged that the 10 years of “deliberate inaction, lack of development and worsening of civic infrastructure services” in Delhi “glossed over by rhetoric and hype generated through advertisements” was now getting “exposed”. The two-day Governors conference will continue on Saturday. On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Draupadi Murmu, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar and Union Home Minister Amit Shah addressed the programme. “In his address, the Prime Minister urged the Governors to play the role of an effective bridge between the Centre and the state and interact with people and social organisations in a manner to co-opt those who are underprivileged,” a press release issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan said. The conference, which ends on Saturday, “will cover a wide range of issues that play a critical role in not only shaping the Centre-state relations but also promoting welfare schemes for common people,” the release said. In her opening remarks, Murmu said it was crucial for the smooth functioning of democracy that various central agencies work with better coordination across all the states. She advised Governors to think about how they, as constitutional heads of their respective states, can promote this coordination. The PM will inaugurate the 32nd International Conference of Agricultural Economists (ICAE) in New Delhi on Saturday. This programme is being held in India after 65 years, an official statement said. The theme of the six-day triennial conference, organised by the International Association of Agricultural Economists, is Transformation Towards Sustainable Agri-Food Systems. The conference will witness participation of around 1,000 delegates from around 75 countries. — With PTI inputs Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates",True,True,True
"Amid pushback against ‘non-locals’, Meghalaya Cabinet gives in to pressure","Amid pushback against ‘non-locals’, Meghalaya Cabinet gives in to pressure  Verifying “criminal antecedents” of migrant workers and a twenty-fold increase in fines for their non-registration — these are some of the major changes that the Meghalaya Cabinet approved to an existing law on Friday as the state witnesses a massive pushback against non-locals. According to Meghalaya government spokesperson Paul Lyngdoh, amendments to the Meghalaya Identification Registration Safety and Security of Migrant Workers 2020 and the rules for the implementation of the Act were among the various topics discussed at the Cabinet meeting on Friday. Among these changes is increasing the fine for non-registration of migrant workers to Rs 1 lakh from the current Rs 5,000, Lyngdoh said after the meeting. The Act itself defines migrant workers as a person “not belonging” to Meghalaya and who is not domiciled in the state but seeks employment in the state and excludes “any work ordinarily involving research or is managerial, administrative or supervisory capacity, etc”. It mandates that every such “migrant worker” be registered with the state government, which will issue them a Registration Card, and places the responsibility for this registration on the person employing or engaging them. The Cabinet decided to adopt a system to “ensure that only those with no criminal antecedents can join the workforce as migrant workmen” in Meghalaya, Lyngdoh said. The Indian government’s Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System is to be used for this, with police and labour departments coordinating in its implementation. “These amendments will be introduced in the state assembly in the upcoming (autumn) session,” Lyngdoh said. The session is to be held from August 23-30. These announcements come against the backdrop of growing pressure from various organisations in the Khasi hills for the implementation of an Inner Line Permit in the state and tighter regulations for those entering the state. Last month, the Khasi Students’ Union claimed that 2,500 workers found “without valid documents” were “pushed back” from the state. There were also reports of migrant workers being assaulted. Following a meeting with KSU on July 19, Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said that while there was no system of “work-permits” in Meghalaya, the state will “strictly” enforce its registration system.

Decode Politics: How a Yogi govt Bill ran into a wall raised by senior UP BJP leaders,"Decode Politics: How a Yogi govt Bill ran into a wall raised by senior UP BJP leaders  In another attempt to project a united front in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP ensured that both its Deputy Chief Ministers in the state were present alongside CM Yogi Adityanath at the Legislature Party meeting convened before the start of the Monsoon Session of the Assembly this week. Days later, that front is again showing cracks. First, the Adityanath government’s Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilization for Public Purposes) Bill ran into objections from the BJP’s own ranks in the Assembly, with City West, Prayagraj, MLA and former minister Sidharth Nath Singh and Prayagraj MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai expressing apprehensions over the legislation. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna even intervened while Bajpai was speaking to appeal: “Aap samajh nahi rahe ho. Pahle padh toh lo (You do not understand the Bill. First, go through it carefully).” BJP ally NISHAD Party’s Anil Tripathi then joined Singh and Bajpai in expressing his misgivings. Then, a day after the Bill cleared the Assembly, the Legislative Council sent it to a Select Committee for further scrutiny. The demand was first made by UP BJP chief and MLC Bhupendra Chaudhary, and supported by Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, who has launched a covert rebellion against Adityanath. While Adityanath in his capacity as CM is the Leader of the BJP in the Assembly, Maurya is the leader of the BJP in the Council. The BJP and allies enjoy a clear majority in both the Houses, which means that it is rare for a Bill to be sent to a Select Committee, that too on a demand made from the Treasury Benches. Nazul land is land originally acquired during the colonial period for specific purposes such as public utilities, administrative functions or for the settlement of displaced individuals. Over time, this land has been used or leased for various public and private purposes. As per the proposed Bill, Nazul land in the state will now be reserved and used exclusively for public purposes. Any court proceedings or applications requesting the transfer of ownership of Nazul land to private individuals or institutions will be cancelled and automatically rejected. In case payments have been made in anticipation of such ownership changes, the amounts are to be refunded. The government could choose to extend the leases of current leaseholders of Nazul land, provided they are in good standing, regularly paying rent, and have not violated lease terms. While BJP leaders as well as the Opposition say they have raised objections to the Bill in “public interest”, the legislation in fact replaces an ordinance that has been in implementation since March this year. The ordinance did not see any significant opposition when it was passed by the Adityanath Cabinet. On Thursday, when Chaudhary proposed that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee, even Opposition members were initially caught off-guard, not knowing how to respond. Even as the latter neither backed nor opposed Chaudhary’s proposal, other BJP leaders expressed their support for Chaudhary, with Maurya indicating it by raising his hand. The other Deputy CM, Brajesh Pathak, was seated next to Maurya in his capacity as minister. He could not vote on the proposal as he is a member of the Assembly and not the Council, but as soon as the decision was taken to send the Bill to the Select Committee, Pathak and Maurya were seen shaking hands. While the Bill saw a discussion in the Assembly on July 31, before it was passed by a voice vote, there was no discussion on it in the Upper House on August 1 before it was sent to the Select Committee. In the Assembly, noting that “governments work in continuation”, Sidharth Nath Singh suggested that those who have been residing on such land for ages and near the end of their lease should be given the opportunity to get an extension. He also suggested that with previous governments alternatively allowing freehold of the land or stopping it, those who continued to pay their instalments after freehold should also be considered. The Indian Express spoke to some members of the Legislative Council, where the Bill saw no discussion. They admitted they had not read the Bill, but added that they knew it would be recommended for Select Committee appraisal as “the public is against the provisions of the Bill”. They could not say what these provisions were. A BJP MLC said: “When the organisational head makes a proposal, we have to follow. He (Chaudhary) is not just a member of the Council but also the head of the state organisation. Even the Leader of our House and Deputy CM Keshav ji supported it. Many people have been approaching us against the provisions as it would displace poor people who have been residing on Nuzul lands for generations… The new law would have given the government the power to take it back at will.” Asked why they did not object when the ordinance was moved, the BJP MLC said he “did not know about that”. “We had to support sending it to the Select Committee, and we did.” About the surprisingly vociferous intervention by BJP MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai on the matter, Prayagraj Mahanagar BJP president Rajendra Mishra said: “Harshvardhan ji is a two-term MLA and always speaks his mind and raises his voice for the people.” He added: “Harshavardhan ji only speaks and works according to the policy and agenda of the party and government.” Bajpai is the grandson of Rajendra Kumar Bajpai, a veteran Congress leader and former Union minister who was seen as close to Indira Gandhi. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav Friday demanded the permanent withdrawal of the “inhuman” Nazul Bill. Taking a swipe at Adityanath in a post on X, Akhilesh said: “The Nazul land issue is entirely a decision to uproot homes because a bulldozer cannot run over every house… What will the BJP gain by demolishing settled homes? Will the BJP render people homeless for the benefit of land mafias?” On Thursday, soon after the Bill was sent to a Select Committee, Akhilesh said the BJP government wanted the law for “the personal benefit” of some people. “There are many such lands in Gorakhpur which some people want to grab to expand their sphere of influence… It is hoped that the Chief Minister will take suo motu cognisance and will not let any such plan succeed, especially in Gorakhpur,” he wrote on X. Gorakhpur is Adityanath’s political turf. Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates Sheikh Hasina gone, her party leaders in hiding",True,True,True
"In with a chance in Haryana, Congress looks to set house in order, unify warring factions","In with a chance in Haryana, Congress looks to set house in order, unify warring factions  Having been hampered by a lack of unity in recent years, the Congress in Haryana is trying to bring together it’s warring factions as it prepares to face the Assembly polls — likely to be held in October — at a time when the ruling BJP is facing a 10-year anti-incumbency on top of the disappointment of having lost half the state’s 10 Lok Sabha seats in June. Giving the Congress hope is Assembly segment-level polling data from the Lok Sabha elections, which show that if the Haryana polls were held today, although it would result in a hung House, the Opposition INDIA bloc would come out on top as an alliance. Attempting to strike a balance between various factions in the state unit, the Congress has constituted a 45-member “strategy committee” that has members of every faction. All top guns of its Haryana unit, as well as their close aides, are there in this list. Chaired by All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge Deepak Babaria, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Udai Bhan is its convener. Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda is a member of the committee along with 42 other leaders. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting in Haryana Bhawan, New Delhi, on August 10 when Hooda, Kumari Selja and other warring leaders could be seen on the same platform for the first time in years. However, Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Singh Surjewala, considered the leader of one of the factions, appeared cautious, telling The Indian Express, “I haven’t seen the constitution of this strategy committee and nobody has informed me about it yet. As such, I am busy in Parliament these days and it is likely the session will get extended. I will only be able to say something on it when I see what this committee is all about.” Selja and Surjewala are the only two Haryana Congress leaders who are also party affairs in-charge for Uttarakhand and Karnataka, respectively. Surjewala is also a member of the Upper House from Rajasthan. Former BJP Union Minister Birender Singh, who recently made a comeback to the Congress, has also been included in the list. Besides Selja, MPs Deepender Hooda, Jai Prakash, Varun Chaudhary and Satpal Brahmchari are part of this committee as are at least eight MLAs: Bharat Bhushan Batra, Aftab Ahmed, Geeta Bhukkal, Rao Dan Singh, Jagbir Malik, Jaiveer Singh Valmiki, Rajender Singh Joon, and Bishan Lal Saini. Others on board include several former ministers and MLAs, some of whom had been voicing out their concerns, such as former Deputy CM Chander Mohan: former ministers Sampat Singh, Anand Singh Dangi, Nirmal Singh, Karan Singh Dalal, Rao Narender Singh, Capt Ajay Singh Yadav; and former chief parliamentary secretaries Anita Yadav and Ram Niwas Ghorela. All three working presidents of the Haryana Congress — Jitender Kumar Bhardwaj, Ram Kishan Gujjar and Suresh Gupta — are also there. Talking about the balancing act carried out in the committee, Deepak Babaria told The Indian Express, “Everybody shall be on the same platform and their suggestions, party feedback, etc, shall be discussed in this meeting. It is basically constituted to discuss the party’s future campaigns, strategy, issues that we need to raise, when and where and how, areas where we need to focus, etc. All party leaders are welcome to share their vision, feedback and suggestions with the sole motive of strengthening the party’s ongoing campaign for the upcoming elections.” On the question of who among Bhupinder Hooda, Selja, and Surjewala would be participating in the strategy committee meeting, Babaria said, “Hopefully, they will all be there. I have always said that dialogue is the key to resolving differences. They should meet more frequently and discuss the issues. Deepender (Hooda) is not the brand ambassador of our ‘Haryana Maange Hisab (Haryana demands accountability)’ campaign. It is a party campaign and he is going wherever he has a clout, or wherever local leaders are calling him. Similarly, Kumari Selja is also taking out the Congress Sandesh Yatra, which is also the party’s campaign. Each and every leader of the party can get out and raise these issues in areas where they have a clout. The core issue is mobilisation of the party cadre, and the people. If anybody is calling another leader of having taken over a campaign, it is incorrect. In this committee, all Haryana Congress leaders have been included and their suggestions, on how to strategise the party’s campaign and strengthen it, shall be welcomed.” Regarding factionalism, Babaria said, “I must say that self-interest serves as a catalyst. If anybody has an aspiration of becoming the CM, he or she must have at least 20-30 MLAs on his or her side. For that, every ambitious party leader will need to work hard, mobilise party cadres to first ensure that the party wins a majority. Rest, the high command and senior leadership decides.” Bhupinder Singh Hooda told The Indian Express, “It is good that everybody has been included in this committee. Everybody shall give their suggestions on shaping the party’s strategy and campaign for the elections.” Other party leaders said the committee would only focus on election strategy and won’t have any role in selection of candidates for the Assembly polls.

"Dalit leader who fought for SC sub-classification: ‘Verdict will benefit a hundred generations of Madigas, other downtrodden castes’","Dalit leader who fought for SC sub-classification: ‘Verdict will benefit a hundred generations of Madigas, other downtrodden castes’  The Supreme Court in a landmark verdict on Thursday allowed the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in reservation, allowing wider protection for underrepresented groups. Following the order, Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said the state would immediately start the process of sub-classification to implement the reservation for the Madiga community and other Dalit sub-castes. Madigas are the largest of the 59 SC sub-castes in Telangana followed by the Malas. According to unofficial estimates of the previous Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) government, SCs make up around 19% of the state’s population. Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi (MRPS) chief Manda Krishna Madiga who has been a vocal supporter of the sub-classification for decades said the top court’s order was a massive victory for the marginalised communities among SCs and STs. During the Telangana Assembly polls last year, amid a BJP outreach to Dalits, Madiga shared the stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a rally, where he was photographed in tears and being consoled by the PM. In an interview with The Indian Express, Manda Krishna Madiga talks about the long-drawn fight for sub-classification, the political support for it, and the impact of the Supreme Court verdict. Excerpts: * How do you feel after winning the battle for sub-caste reservation? The decades-long agitation of Madiga people has come to a conclusion as we got what we desired. The movement, which started in 1994, has come to a conclusion after 30 long years. The judgment has brought us much happiness. * How has this journey been for you? The agitation saw many ups and downs, and efforts were made to derail it several times. We suffered a lot during the process. But we got the support of people from across the spectrum. We are happy about that. * Who will this judgment benefit? A hundred generations to come ahead will benefit from this. Our sacrifices have not been in vain. A hundred generations of Madigas and other downtrodden castes will benefit from this judgment. * What contributed to this victory? I attribute this victory to three kinds of people. One, those who gave up their lives for reservation. Secondly, MRPS workers who overcame all odds to stand by the party. Next, I also thank the support given by people of different castes to this agitation. * There are several people who died by suicide in public for the MRPS’s cause. What is your plan for their family members? We will form committees to support the families. We will give them all that they need after bringing the matter up for discussion in the MRPS governing body. * Have you received support from any political parties in the past? We have got support from several parties, including the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Congress, and the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS). * Did the BJP support you? Yes, we did get support from the BJP too before the elections. * Which party are you aligned with now? We stand independent at this juncture. We have taken help from all parties who supported the sub-categorisation agitation. But we are an independent party that struggled and agitated on our own.

"Haryana most-deprived Dalit groups see ‘new life’, want law for quota within quota in current session","Haryana most-deprived Dalit groups see ‘new life’, want law for quota within quota in current session  Soon after the Supreme Court order Thursday empowering states to go ahead with sub-categorisation within the Scheduled Castes for the purpose of reservations, the ‘Dalit-A Mahapanchayat Haryana’ announced that it would meet Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini to press that a legislation to enforce this be introduced in the ongoing Monsoon Session. Several Dalit groups, excluding those who work in the leather industry, have been seeking quota within the overall 20% SC quota to help them avail the benefits of reservation. The Dalit A Mahapanchayat is one of them. However, the group that works in the leather industry and enjoys a level of affluence has been opposed, saying such a measure would hurt Dalit unity. After Thursday’s order, they said they would be meeting BJP leaders to demand that the status quo be maintained on the issue in Haryana. With the Assembly polls in Haryana coming soon, both sides realise that they can put pressure on parties to concede their demands. Dalit-A Mahapanchayat president Devi Das Valmiki said: “We will hold a big rally if a quota within the SC quota for government jobs is not given before the Assembly polls.” The Dalit A Mahapanchayat also believes it has a strong case because, in March 2020, conceding the demand of Dalit groups like it, the Haryana Assembly had passed a Bill creating a quota within the SC quota for seats in the state’s higher educational institutions for a newly designated “Deprived Scheduled Castes” category. This category includes 36 communities, such as the Valmikis, Bazigars, Sansis, Dehas, Dhanaks and Saperas. The Dalit A Mahapanchayat wants a similar sub-quota now for government jobs. According to government sources, the ‘Deprived Scheduled Castes’ cover almost the entire SC category, which comprises around 11% of the state’s population. Haryana was an interested party in the case before the Supreme Court as in 1994, the then Congress government in the state led by Bhajan Lal had bifurcated the SC quota into two groups – ‘Block A’, comprising the more deprived Dalit groups, and ‘Block B’, comprising the Dalits working in the leather industry. In 2006, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had quashed the 1994 notification, citing the decision of a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the E V Chinnaiah vs State Of Andhra Pradesh And Others case. On Thursday, a seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court overruled this order. Devi Das Valmiki told The Indian Express: “The current BJP government should have implemented the quota within the SC reservation in government jobs too when it introduced one for admission in educational institutions in 2020. After the latest Supreme Court decision, it should be implemented as early as possible, without delay. The ball is now in the court of the state government.” He called the Supreme Court decision a “lifeline” for them. “From 1966 to now, no one from our community has become a Lok Sabha MP from Haryana, even as the state has two seats reserved for SCs.” Devi Das Valmiki claimed that after the 2004 apex court order, “even the graduates or postgraduates from our communities did not get enough employment in the state”. However, the president of the Hisar unit of the ‘Dr B R Ambedkar Sabha’, Raghubir Sunda, termed the Supreme Court order “unfortunate”, warning that it could have “adverse effects for SCs”. “A significant number of government posts out of the 20% set aside for SCs are lying vacant in Haryana with the remark ‘not found a suitable candidate’. The Supreme Court judgment would just increase this backlog for government jobs. More government posts for SCs will fall vacant. Even in educational institutions, the representation of SCs has decreased after the implementation of a quota within the SC quota,” Sunda claimed. He added: “When there is no caste-based census, then how can such a decision be implemented?” Independent voices within SC groups called for unity among community members in “the larger interest”. A Scheduled Caste leader who did not wish to be identified said: “This is the time for unity among SCs for upliftment of the community members. We should not fall prey to the agenda of divisive politics, and avoid any conflict on the issue.” Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates",True,True,True

India needs comprehensive policy solution to mushrooming of coaching institutes: Congress,"India needs comprehensive policy solution to mushrooming of coaching institutes, says Congress    Updated - August 03, 2024 05:39 pm IST Published - August 03, 2024 05:13 pm IST - New Delhi Congress leader Jairam Ramesh. File   Photo Credit: PTI India needs a comprehensive policy solution to the mushrooming of coaching institutes, the Congress said on August 3 and called for a revision of syllabi, more resources for all exam-takers and investments in the quality of education. Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said data provided by the Department of Higher Education to the Rajya Sabha shows that Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections from coaching institutes have risen rapidly between 2019 and 2024, from ₹2,241 crore to ₹5,517 crore. “This represents an astonishing 146% rise in GST collections, some part of which may be attributable to better enforcement, but it also likely comes from the growing market size,” he said. ""Worryingly, the GST collections of ₹5,517 crore in FY24, collected at a rate of 18%, suggests a market of ₹30,653 crore for coaching institutes annually. This is an extremely worrying figure, since it corresponds to about two-thirds of the Union Budget's allocation for higher education in FY24,"" Mr. Ramesh said in a post on X. “GST figures are likely underestimating the market for coaching institutes, which is notorious for its poor regulation,” he added. ""India needs a comprehensive policy solution to this mushrooming of coaching institutes — syllabi need to be revised, and brought in line with school curriculum, more resources need to be made available for all exam-takers, and investments must be made in the quality of education,"" he said. His remarks came amid a focus on coaching institutes following the death of three civil service aspirants after the basement of such an institute in Delhi's Old Rajinder Nagar area was flooded due to rains. Mr. Ramesh also posted on X a written answer on coaching institutes given by Minister of State in the Education Ministry Sukanta Mazumdar in Parliament last week, in which he said keeping in view the growth in the number of unregulated private coaching centres in the country in the absence of any laid-down policy or regulation, the Ministry has circulated the Guidelines for Regulation of Coaching Centre among the States and Union Territories on January 16 for consideration by way of an appropriate legal framework. Education being on the Concurrent list, the states and Union territories need to take further action by way of an appropriate legal framework, Mr. Mazumdar said.

defense secretary lloyd austin withdraws plea deal for accused 9/11 terrorists,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin withdraws plea deal for accused 9/11 terrorists          WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday withdrew the controversial plea deal for the three men accused of planning the 9/11 attacks. ""Today, Secretary Austin signed a memo reserving for himself the specific authority to enter into pre-trial agreements with the accused in the 9/11 military commission cases,"" the Defense Department said in a press release. ""In addition, as the superior convening authority, the Secretary has also withdrawn from the pre-trial agreements that were signed in those cases."" Austin announced the move in a memo addressed to Susan Escallier, the convening authority for military commissions, who had worked to negotiate the deal. “Effective immediately, I hereby withdraw your authority in the above-referenced case to enter into a pre-trial agreement and reserve such authority to myself,” Austin said in the letter, which removes Escallier from the case. The defense secretary, who designated Escalier to serve as convening authority for military commissions in 2023, said that he made the determination ""in light of the significance"" of the decision to make a plea deal, adding that ""responsibility for such a decision should rest with me."" Officials said on Wednesday that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin ‘Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi had reached plea agreements. The three men were expected to plead guilty to lesser charges that would prevent them from receiving the death penalty, but the terms of the revoked deal remain unknown. The plea deal had been negotiated among the accused men, their attorneys and Escallier. Officials previously said that the accused had been scheduled to appear at a hearing at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba next week. Mohammed is accused of being a mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, which killed 2,977 people. A White House National Security Council spokesperson declined to comment, referring NBC News to the Defense Department. The Defense Department declined to comment beyond the press release. Congressional Republicans celebrated Austin’s decision to revoke the deal.  Rep. Michael McCaul, who chairs the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was “glad to see” Austin’s move. “As I said previously, if any case warrants the death penalty, it’s this one,” said the Texas Republican in a post to X. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that Austin ""did the right thing."" ""The previous plea deal would have sent absolutely the wrong signal to terrorists throughout the world,"" Graham said. ""I know the families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks will appreciate this — as do I."" The head of 9/11 Justice, a self-described grassroots movement of 9/11 victims' families, expressed frustration over families being left out of the discussions regarding the proceedings against the suspects. “We are astounded and deeply frustrated that our families were not consulted or even notified in advance of the plea deal or its subsequent revocation,” said the group's president Brett Eagleson. ""These monsters need to be forced to share every piece of information they have about the attacks and be held fully accountable for the murder of our loved ones."" The plea deal had originally been met with criticism from families of victims and members of Congress. The Republican-led House Oversight Committee said on Friday before Austin announced his decision that it would open an investigation into the White House's role in the plea deal. Similarly, Rep. Mike Rogers, the Alabama Republican who serves as the chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a letter to Austin that he was ""deeply shocked and angered by news"" of a plea deal. Speaker Mike Johnson linked the two GOP-led committees with Austin's decision, saying in a Friday night post to X that ""the Biden-Harris Administration is correct to reverse course after receiving letters from @GOPoversight and @HASCRepublicans launching investigations into this terrible plea deal."" Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who served in the Obama administration, slammed the deal in a Thursday statement. ""The people responsible for structuring this awful deal did the best they could. They were dealt a bad hand by the political hacks and those who lost faith in our justice system,” Holder told NBC News. Holder had said in 2009 that the accused men would be brought to trial in federal court in Manhattan, where they could face the death penalty. While that plan did not come to fruition after members of Congress blocked the transfer of all inmates from Guantánamo Bay in Cuba to the U.S., the slow pace of the defendants' progress through the military commissions system — a form of military tribunal administered by the Defense Department — resulted in some unlikely support for a federal trial. Former Attorney General William Barr, who served in the administrations of former Presidents Donald Trump and George H.W. Bush, called the military commissions a “hopeless mess” and said the government would “likely succeed in obtaining a conviction” in federal court. Megan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.

U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich freed from Russian prison as part of major exchange,"U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich freed from Russian prison as part of major exchange          Four U.S. residents wrongly imprisoned in Russia — including journalist Evan Gershkovich and Marine veteran Paul Whelan — were released Thursday, part of a major multinational prisoner exchange the likes of which has not been seen since the Cold War. The massive deal, cut among seven nations, involves 24 people, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens held in Russia, and eight Russians imprisoned in the U.S., Germany, Slovenia, Norway and Poland. President Joe Biden called the deal that had led to the release of the four U.S. detainees a “feat of diplomacy and friendship.” The exchange took place in Turkey, and a plane carrying U.S. citizens Gershkovich, Whelan and Alsu Kurmasheva touched down at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland at 11:38 p.m. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris greeted all three Americans on the tarmac, and each then hugged friends and family to applause. Biden said he told each, ""welcome home,"" and more. ""There's nothing beyond our capacity when we act together,"" Biden told reporters when asked if he had a message for America. ""We're the United States of America."" Vladimir Kara-Murza, a legal permanent U.S. resident, had planned to go Germany, where his family was set to meet him, but is expected to return to the U.S. soon, the administration said. Follow the latest updates here. “Now, their brutal ordeal is over and they’re free,” Biden said in a televised address from the White House earlier Thursday as he stood alongside family members of those freed. “This is an incredible relief for all the family members gathered here. It’s relief to the friends and colleagues all across the country who have been praying for this day for a long time.” Gershkovich, a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, was arrested in March 2023 while reporting in Yekaterinburg, an industrial city east of Moscow. In July, he was convicted of espionage in a Russian court in a trial widely condemned as a sham as his publication vociferously advocated for his release across its front pages. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Whelan, a businessman who has been detained since visiting Russia for a friend’s wedding in 2018, was also convicted of espionage and had been serving a 16-year sentence in a penal colony. The U.S. has denied those charges. Whelan was excluded from two previous exchanges, and in an interview from prison in December, Whelan told the BBC that he considered the United States’ decision to leave him behind a “serious betrayal.” Kurmasheva is a journalist with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. is a Pulitzer Prize-winning Russian dissident, and dual Russian British national and U.S. permanent resident. He was jailed on treason charges for 25 years in April 2023. Biden noted that Kara-Murza was a pallbearer during the funeral of Sen. John McCain. At one point during his national address, Biden took Kurmasheva’s daughter’s hand and sang a few lines of “Happy Birthday” to her. In a statement, Emma Tucker, The Wall Street Journal’s editor-in-chief, said, “Today is a joyous day for the safe return of our colleague Evan Gershkovich.” “All those who spoke up for Evan and worked for his release ... can know that their support made a huge difference and is greatly, greatly appreciated,” Tucker added. The complex prisoner swap is a rare example of cooperation amid heightened political tensions between the U.S. and Russia, including sanctions imposed on Russia and Russian officials over the invasion of Ukraine starting in 2022. Relations between the two countries had been strained before the war, following Russian interference in the 2016 election and its annexation of Crimea. The most notable Russian prisoner released as part of the swap is Vadim Krasikov, who was jailed for life in Germany for the 2019 murder in Berlin of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former Chechen separatist, in what prosecutors believed was a Russian state-sanctioned assassination. Russian authorities said they believed Khangoshvili was involved in multiple attacks on Russian soil, including the 2010 suicide bombings on the Moscow Metro. The U.S. released three Russian prisoners, including an intelligence operative facing charges of smuggling U.S. technology and ammunition to the Russian military. Slovenia released two Russian prisoners; Norway and Poland each released one. Russia released five German prisoners, as well as seven Russian citizens who were political prisoners held in their own country, according to a statement from the White House. Later, Biden said four of them were connected to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in prison in February following a yearslong struggle against official corruption and President Vladimir Putin’s government that included several poisoning attempts. Former Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev responded to the swap by saying that he would like “the traitors of Russia to rot in prison or die in jail, as has often happened. But it is more useful to get out our own, who worked for the country, for the Fatherland, for all of us.” “And let the traitors now feverishly select new names and actively disguise themselves under a witness protection program,” he added. The Biden administration has been working on Thursday’s swap since December 2022 after WNBA star Brittney Griner was exchanged for notorious Russian arms dealer Victor Bout, known as the “Merchant of Death.” Griner was arrested at an airport near Moscow after two vape cartridges containing hashish oil were found in her luggage. The swap raised a debate about the risks of exchanging wrongfully detained Americans for Russian prisoners, with critics pointing out that there was no equivalence between the crimes Griner and Bout were convicted of, and that it may encourage foreign adversaries to kidnap Americans abroad and use them as bargaining chips. National security adviser Jake Sullivan called the exchange “historic” and said that not since the Cold War has there been one involving such a large number of people, “and there has never, so far as we know, been an exchange involving so many countries, so many close U.S. partners and allies working together.” The deal was “the culmination of many rounds of complex, painstaking negotiations over many, many months,” he added. Biden said on the tarmac of Joint Base Andrews that other countries made difficult decisions in making the exchange happen. He singled out Germany, which agreed to release a convicted hitman who killed someone in Berlin, and the chancellor of Slovenia. ""The toughest call on this one was for other countries, because I asked them to do some things that were against their immediate self-interests,"" Biden said. ""And it was very difficult for them to do."" Carol E. Lee is the Washington managing editor. Aurora Almendral is a London-based editor with NBC News Digital.

Middle East on knife-edge after alleged Israeli killing of Hamas leader in Iran,"Middle East on knife-edge after killing of Hamas leader in Iran; Israel's opponents vow retaliation                                                                                                                      The Middle East is on edge after a dramatic escalation that saw top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh killed in a strike in the Iranian capital of Tehran early Wednesday. Iranian officials are blaming Israel for what they say is an assassination, but a spokesman for Israel's government on Wednesday declined to comment on the death of Haniyeh, Reuters reported. ""Israel was very clear - Haniyeh was a dead man walking,"" Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, wrote in a post on X following the news. ""Once out of Doha, it was game time. Coming hours after the killing of Fuad Shukr in Beirut, the Middle East is on an absolute knife-edge now."" Just one day prior, Israeli forces declared that they killed Hezbollah's second-in-command, Fuad Shukr, in a strike on a densely populated area of Beirut, in retaliation for a strike last week on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed several children. Israel blames Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese militant organization, for the attack, a charge the group has thus far denied. Haniyeh served as the chief of Hamas' politburo and was seen as a more relatively moderate figure within the organization — importantly, he led cease-fire negotiations with Israel and was the face of the group's regional diplomatic efforts. The alleged Israeli killing of Haniyeh marks a blow to Hamas and essentially torpedoes any near-term chances of a cease-fire between the Palestinian militant group and Israel in the brutal war in Gaza that is now in its 10th month. Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani wrote on X: ""Political assassinations & continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side? Peace needs serious partners & a global stance against the disregard for human life."" Qatar's government has long hosted Hamas' political leadership. Haniyeh was made the head of Hamas' political wing in 2017 before moving to Qatar in exile in 2019. After leaving Gaza he was succeeded by Yahya Sinwar, a much more hard-line Hamas devotee. Sinwar is believed to be the mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took a further 253 hostage, 116 of whom have since been freed. Israel's military response to the attack has killed more than 39,000 people in Gaza, health authorities in the blockaded enclave say, and destroyed more than half of all its buildings, according to the U.N. While cease-fire talks have been ongoing for months with no success, the more extreme Sinwar — who is based inside Gaza and is said to have the last word on Hamas' major decisions — often stalls or cuts off communications during negotiations. Haniyeh served as ""a key interlocutor in talks for a cease-fire in Gaza,"" Victor Tricaud, a senior analyst at consulting firm Control Risks, told CNBC. ""His killing will throw the talks off course and means that the far less compromising position of Hamas' leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, will face less moderating counterweight from within the group,"" Tricaud said. ""A cease-fire deal will likely remain out of reach for several more months."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meanwhile continued to stress that a cease-fire deal is ""the enduring imperative"" while speaking at a forum in Singapore, and denied that the U.S. had any knowledge of the alleged Israeli strike on Haniyeh. The U.S. State Department in 2018 designated Haniyeh a terrorist, describing him as ""a proponent of armed struggle, including against civilians,"" and declared that Hamas operations had been responsible for ""an estimated 17 American lives killed in terrorist attacks."" Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah have all vowed revenge; but the choice of actions they take against Israel could lead to further escalation or plunge the region into a larger war. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israel Defense Forces troops on Wednesday that Israel ""doesn't want a war, but is preparing for all possibilities."" Iran's leadership meanwhile has said that the alleged Israeli strike is grounds for ""severe punishment"" and that the country must ""pay a heavy price."" An all-out war between Israel and Iran — and Iran's proxies such as Hezbollah — would be devastating to all sides involved. But not responding at all may not be an option for Iran's leaders who will face pressure to deliver a show of force. Haniyeh's death in Tehran ""puts Iran's leadership under strong pressure from the Revolutionary Guards to retaliate after another attack on Iranian soil,"" Torbjorn Soltvedt, principal MENA analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC. ""Israel and Iran have already demonstrated their ability to pose a serious threat to each other, but the risk of another cycle of attacks is now increasing."" Still, many regional analysts expect Iran to be conservative in its reaction, as so far the Islamic Republic has shown little interest in going to war with Israel to help Hamas. Tit-for-tat exchanges of missile strikes between Iran and Israel in April saw attacks that were essentially measured and telegraphed to avoid significant damage or casualties. Tricaud at Control Risks expects any retaliation ""to be very calibrated – likely leveraging Iran-backed proxy groups,"" he said. ""It remains unclear that Tehran's intent to avoid a full-blown regional conflict with Israel has changed as a result of Haniyeh's killing."" While the strike does constitute a major violation of the Islamic Republic's sovereignty, he added, ""Tehran has repeatedly shown that it does not want to be dragged in a direct conflict with Israel over the war in Gaza.""

Iran says Israel will ‘pay heavy price’ after death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,"Iran says Israel will 'pay heavy price' after death of top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh                                                                                                                      Iranian officials are condemning what they say was an Israeli strike on Tehran that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Palestinian militant organization Hamas and Iran's Revolutionary Guard issued separate statements confirming the death of the longtime political leader of Hamas early Wednesday and blamed Israel, which has not yet commented on Haniyeh's death. CNBC has reached out to Israel's Foreign Ministry for comment. Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani and former commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Mohsen Rezaei, in separate comments said that Israel will ""pay a heavy price,"" according to Iranian state media. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei in a statement said that ""the criminal and terrorist Zionist regime has prepared the ground for severe punishment with this action."" He added that carrying out punishment is ""our duty"" as Haniyeh was killed in Iran. Tehran and other countries that do not recognize the state of Israel frequently refer to it as ""the Zionist regime."" Haniyeh served as the chief of Hamas' politburo and was seen as a more relatively moderate figure within the organization as he led cease-fire negotiations and was the face of the group's regional diplomatic efforts. He was made the head of Hamas' political wing in 2017 before moving to Qatar in exile in 2019. The U.S. State Department in 2018 designated Haniyeh a terrorist, describing him as ""a proponent of armed struggle, including against civilians,"" and declared that Hamas operations had been responsible for ""an estimated 17 American lives killed in terrorist attacks."" Haniyeh's death comes against the backdrop of spiking tensions in the Middle East, as Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza rages on. It also comes just a day after an Israeli strike on a densely populated area of Beirut, which Israel's military said killed a top commander of the Lebanese militant organization Hezbollah. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and allied with Hamas, issued a statement in response to Haniyeh's death. ""The martyrdom of the leader Haniyeh will increase the determination and stubbornness of the resistance fighters in all resistance arenas to continue the path of jihad, and will make their resolve stronger in confronting the Zionist enemy,"" the group said.

IDF targets Beirut suburb in retaliation for attack that killed 12 in the Golan Heights,"Israel says it killed Hezbollah leader in Beirut strike after attack on Golan Heights          Israel’s military says it has killed a Hezbollah official who it blamed for a deadly attack last week on the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 young people. The Israel Defense Forces said it killed Fuad Shukr on Tuesday in an airstrike in the area of Beirut in Lebanon. The IDF said that Shukr “was the commander responsible for the murder of the 12 children in Majdal Shams in northern Israel on Saturday evening, as well as the killing of numerous Israelis and foreign nationals over the years.” Israel was targeting Shukr, better known by his nickname, Hajj Mohsen, in the strike in a suburb of southern Beirut, an Israeli official told NBC News. Mohsen is a senior adviser to Hezbollah’s supreme leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a member of the group’s military council, according to a U.S. government profile. Shukr “has the blood of many Israelis on his hands. Tonight, we have shown that the blood of our people has a price, and that there is no place out of reach for our forces to this end,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the rocket attack Saturday, which struck a soccer field in the Golan Heights. Militants in Lebanon and Israel have been trading fire since Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel and the start of the war in Gaza, raising fears that the fighting will spiral into a regional conflict. Al Manar, a satellite television station run by Hezbollah, reported that Israel had ""launched an aerial aggression that targeted the southern suburb of Beirut."" ""Local sources reported that the raid in the Haret Hreik area was carried out by a drone and 3 missiles were fired,"" the report added. The television station also said a building Israel targeted in the Haret Hreik area, a Hezbollah stronghold, had collapsed. Al Manar reported that two people were killed and at least 10 were wounded in the strike. Personnel from the emergency room at Bahman Hospital in Beirut told NBC News that a woman was killed and 17 other people were wounded, including six children and two who were in critical condition. In a statement, the Lebanese Red Cross said more than one person had been killed and over 20 had been injured. The Lebanese Health Ministry said a woman was killed and up to 68 other people were injured, five of them critically. Photographs from the area also showed cars crushed and covered with rubble. Saturday's strike on Majdal Shams killed at least 12 people, most of them children and teenagers belonging to the minority Druze community. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack. In a series of statements Saturday, it did say it had struck nearby military targets in the Golan Heights. In one statement, it claimed to have used a Falaq-1 rocket, the same munition Israel says hit the soccer field. However, the timings in the Hezbollah statements do not neatly align with the strike. Hezbollah said the Falaq-1 rocket was fired at 5:20 p.m., while the IDF says Majdal Shams was hit at 6:18 p.m. The Israeli military said the attack on Majdal Shams, which is on the border with Lebanon, was the deadliest strike on civilians in Israeli territory since Oct. 7. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed back to Tel Aviv from the U.S. as outrage built in Israel. “Israel is approaching the moment of an all-out war against Hezbollah,” the Israeli military said at the time. “The IDF is prepared and ready to protect Israel’s security.” In January, an Israeli airstrike on Beirut killed Saleh Arouri, a top Hamas official. It was the first time Israel had hit Beirut since the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Asked for comment Tuesday's strike, a White House National Security Council spokesperson told NBC News that the agency defers to Israel ""to speak to its own military operations"" but supports its right to defend itself. ""Our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad and unwavering against all Iran-backed threats, including Hezbollah, and we are working on a diplomatic solution that will allow citizens to safely return to their homes,"" the spokesperson said. Israel’s military said that Shukr joined Hezbollah in 1985 and that he was the head of Hezbollah’s Strategic Unit and had responsibility for weaponry that included missiles, rockets and drones.

Elon Musk attends Netanyahu’s speech to Congress as his guest; dozens of members skip,"Elon Musk attends Netanyahu's speech to Congress as his guest, but dozens of lawmakers skip it                                                                                                                      Elon Musk made a surprise appearance in Washington Wednesday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress, attending the event as Netanyahu's guest. Musk sat in Netanyahu's private box in the visitors gallery above the House floor, alongside Netanyahu's wife Sara, several Israeli soldiers and at least one former hostage of Hamas. The Tesla Motors CEO's visit to Capitol Hill came a day after he announced on X that his satellite internet company Starlink had been activated in a Gaza hospital, with the support of Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Nine months into the Israel-Hamas war and the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Netanyahu's speech has become a lightning rod of controversy, triggering an eruption of protests in Washington. Shortly before Netanyahu was scheduled to begin speaking, U.S. Capitol Police announced they were ""deploying pepper spray"" against protesters who had ""started to become violent"" close to the Capitol. Netanyahu scolded the protesters in his speech, calling them ""Iran's useful idiots."" ""These protesters chant from river to the sea, but many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about."" Netanyahu said. More than 30 members of Congress did not attend Netanyahu's address, many of them skipping the event in protest of the Israeli prime minister's approach to the Israel-Hamas war. One of Netanyahu's most vocal opponents in Congress, however, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., did attend the speech. At several points, Tlaib held up a sign that read ""War Criminal."" The clear breach of House decorum reflects the deep and painful divisions in Congress over the prime minister's leadership. Despite the absences, the prime minister entered a crowded House floor to loud applause and cheering, shaking hands with various lawmakers on his way to the podium. ""America and Israel must stand together because when we stand together something very simple happens. We win, they lose,"" Netanyahu said at the opening of his remarks. The Prime Minister expressed gratitude to President Joe Biden ""for his heartfelt support for Israel."" ""President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years,"" Netanyahu said. ""I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel."" Biden and Netanyahu are scheduled to meet at the White House on Thursday. Vice President Kamala Harris did not attend Netanyahu's speech, a conspicuous departure from tradition. The White House attributed her absence to the demands of travel. Harris will have a separate meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday. Typically, the vice president presides over joint congressional sessions, but Harris is traveling Wednesday, as the newly minted Democratic front-runner for the party's presidential nomination. Former President Donald Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also skipped the speech due to his ""duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for Vice President,"" a Trump campaign official told NBC News. In the vice president's absence, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., would usually take her place as the president pro tempore of the Senate, but she did not attend Netanyahu's address for ideological reasons, according to NBC News. Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Md., presided over Netanyahu's joint address. ""The United States relationship with the State of Israel transcends politics and partisanship,"" Cardin said in a statement to NBC News. ""It transcends any one Israeli government or any one U.S. administration."" Though Harris attributed her Wednesday absence to travel, many of the at least 30 lawmakers said they skipped the speech to boycott Netanyahu. Several, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said they would instead meet with families of hostages held by Hamas or attend a panel on Middle East peace and security. ""Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress. On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., among the loudest critics of Netanyahu as the war carries on. Wednesday's speech was Netanyahu's fourth address to Congress, the last of which took place in March 2015. While the Prime Minister is on Capitol Hill, he will meet with the top four congressional lawmakers: House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

Palestinian rivals Hamas and Fatah sign reconciliation agreement in China ,"Palestinian rivals Hamas and Fatah sign reconciliation agreement in China                                                                                                                      Rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah agreed to end their long-standing enmity and work to form a national unity government following talks held in China, Chinese state media reported Tuesday. ""On the morning of July 23, the closing ceremony of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions was held in Beijing. Representatives of Palestinian factions signed the 'Beijing Declaration' on ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,"" Chinese state media outlet CGTN wrote in a post on local social media platform Weibo, according to a translation provided by the website and vetted by CNBC. The ""inter-Palestinian reconciliation dialogue,"" as it was described by the state outlet, had been underway in Beijing since Sunday. This renewed attempt at unity marks a significant development, as Hamas and Fatah have been bitter enemies ever since the bloody 2006-2007 civil war in the Gaza Strip. Fatah, the Palestinian political party then governed both the West Bank and the Gaza enclave at the time, was violently kicked out of the latter territory, following Hamas' election win in the Strip in 2006. Hamas has governed the Gaza enclave since then and is currently embroiled in a brutal war with Israel. The offensive was triggered by the Hamas-led terror attacks of Oct. 7, which resulted in 1,200 deaths in Israel, with a further 253 people taken hostage by Hamas into the Gaza Strip, according to Israeli tallies. The Palestinian militant group is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and U.K. In the months since, Israel's retaliatory assaults on the Gaza Strip have killed nearly 39,000 Palestinians there, according to health authorities in the enclave. Hussam Badran, a senior Hamas official taking part in the talks, said in a statement cited by Reuters that ""this declaration comes at an important time"" amid Israel's war in Gaza, and that the agreement was an ""additional positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity."" Fatah, formally called the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, is led by Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority (PA). The PA, and Fatah as its dominant party, govern the West Bank — a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel. Chinese state media hailed the agreement, saying it was signed by 14 Palestinian factions, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called it a ""historic moment for the cause of Palestine's liberation."" But this is far from the first time that Hamas and Fatah have signed reconciliation pacts, only to return to hostilities due to persisting disagreements. ""Before everyone gets excited and files a batch of stories about China as the Middle East's new diplomatic power: a reminder that, since 2006, Hamas and Fatah also signed reconciliation agreements in Algiers, Cairo, Doha, Mecca and Sana'a, none of which actually reconciled them,"" Gregg Carlstrom, author of the book ""How Long Will Israel Survive? The Threat From Within,"" wrote in a post on X. While statements following the talks highlighted the signatories' consensus on building an interim unity government that would be established with China's support, long-time observers of the region noted that meetings and declarations will not determine success for the diplomatic efforts. ""Since 2007, there have been numerous rounds of negotiation and even provisional agreements aimed at reconciliation but they have all failed,"" Taufiq Rahim, principal at 2040 Advisory and author of ""Middle East in Crisis & Conflict: A Primer,"" told CNBC. ""The devil is not in the details but the implementation,"" he said. ""Given the many uncertainties on the ground and the upcoming US elections the deal could be upended easily."" China has increasingly moved to expand its role in international diplomacy, making world headlines in March of 2023 when it helped broker a historic normalization agreement between then-adversaries Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Journalist Evan Gershkovich sentenced to 16 years by Russian court in case U.S. slams as a sham,"Journalist Evan Gershkovich sentenced to 16 years by Russian court in case U.S. slams as a sham          American journalist Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in a maximum security prison by a Russian court Friday after he was found guilty of espionage in a case that his employer, The Wall Street Journal, and the U.S. government have condemned as a sham. Gershkovich, 32, denied any wrongdoing in the case, which went to trial last month in the city of Yekaterinburg more than a year after he was arrested in the southern Russian city on espionage charges. The Sverdlovsk Regional Court’s press service told NBC News in a telephone interview that the state prosecutor had requested Gershkovich be sentenced to 18 years of imprisonment during closing arguments. In a separate announcement, the court said Gershkovich had been found guilty of collecting secret information about the activities of a defense enterprise for the production and repair of military equipment on instructions from U.S. intelligence services. The Sverdlovsk Regional Court’s Judge Andrei Mineyev remanded Gershkovich into custody until his sentence can be legally enforced. The journalist is also expected to cover the legal fees, amounting to just over $75. His defense team has 15 days to appeal the sentence. Russia has never published any clear evidence supporting its claims against Gershkovich. And Jay Conti, executive vice president and general counsel for Dow Jones, WSJ’s publisher, told The Associated Press in a recent interview that the trial was a “sham” based on “bogus charges that are completely trumped up.” The U.S. government has also condemned the charges against Gershkovich and considers him wrongfully detained. President Joe Biden has repeatedly called on his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to release the journalist, who was arrested during a reporting trip. In the weeks after Gershkovich’s arrest, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a news conference that the U.S. would do “everything in its power” to bring the journalist home. Gershkovich’s detention also became a point of contention in the U.S. presidential race, with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claiming in May that he could get Putin to free Gershkovich if elected. His comments drew swift backlash from Biden’s campaign. Prior to Friday’s conviction and sentencing, Russia had repeatedly extended Gershkovich’s detainment, which has been condemned by journalists and government officials across the West, who see it as emblematic of the war Putin has waged against freedom of speech both in Russia and abroad. Putin has signaled in the past that he believes a deal could be struck to free Gershkovich. A possible exchange had been in the works that could have resulted in the releases of Gershkovich, former Marine Paul Whelan and Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, sources told NBC News in February. The swap was not thought to be imminent when Navalny’s death in an Arctic penal colony was announced that month, five sources told NBC News. At previous court appearances in both Moscow and Yekaterinburg, Gershkovich has often smiled and appeared in good spirits. But his detention has weighed on his family. “It has been hard,” his father, Mikhail Gershkovich, told NBC News in March to mark the anniversary of his arrest. “He spent all four seasons there. He spent his birthday and all the holidays. We want him home as soon as possible.” His parents left what was then the Soviet Union for the U.S. during the Cold War. Gershkovich and his older sister grew up speaking Russian at home, and the family calls him “Vanya,” the diminutive for his Russian name, Ivan. His interest in Russia motivated his decision to move there in 2017 to work as a journalist. But everything changed when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the family said. Like many other foreign reporters wary of Russia’s tightening grip on press freedom, Gershkovich moved abroad, albeit regularly returning for reporting trips.

Trump Media shares close up more than 30% after assassination attempt,"Trump Media shares close up more than 30% after assassination attempt                                                                                                                      In this article Trump Media shares closed up more than 30% Monday, two days after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, the company's majority shareholder. The stock's rise was accompanied by massive trading volume. More than 76 million shares of the Truth Social app owner changed hands Monday, ten times the stock's 30-day average. Trump, who was formally nominated as the Republican Party's presidential candidate Monday, said he was grazed by a bullet and treated at a local hospital in Pennsylvania on Saturday but was released late Saturday after the shooting. Shares in Trump Media were 50% higher in premarket trading at 6:29 a.m. ET, off earlier highs. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes offered his ""deepest sympathies"" to those who were wounded in the attack in Pennsylvania and to the family of the person killed at the event. ""The situation demands a fast, thorough federal investigation to determine all the circumstances of this cowardly attack and to identify if any additional persons were involved,"" Nunes said in a Saturday statement. ""I also call for the federal government to provide any security resources requested by President Trump to guarantee his safety,"" he added. Analysts suggested the assassination attempt could make a Trump victory in the November election more likely. ""The events on Saturday, if they do anything, they strengthen the case for President Donald Trump to win the election in November. I think that's what the markets have reacted to this evening,"" Rob Casey, partner at Signum Global Advisors told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday. Trump Media, the parent company of social media platform Truth Social, has seen volatile trading throughout the election race. The stock plummeted nearly 50% in the three weeks following the felony conviction of Trump, who is also the firm's majority shareholder. It comes as Truth Social struggles to grow its small user base. In its first-quarter earnings report, filed in May, Trump Media posted a net loss of $327.6 million and total revenue of $770,500. The company warned investors last month that if Trump uses other social media platforms beyond Truth Social, it ""could have a material adverse effect on the business and/or operations of TMTG.""

NATO condemns China as a ‘decisive enabler’ of Russia’s war in Ukraine in most serious rebuke to date,"NATO condemns China as a 'decisive enabler' of Russia's war in Ukraine in most serious rebuke to date                                                                                                                      In NATO's most serious denunciation of China to date, the military coalition labeled Beijing a ""decisive enabler"" of Russia in its ongoing war in Ukraine and expressed concerns over its nuclear arsenal and ""systemic challenges"" to the coalition's security. ""The PRC has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called 'no limits' partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base,"" a NATO communique said Wednesday, on the second day of a Washington summit celebrating the alliance's 75th anniversary.   The coalition further called on Beijing to ""cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,"" specifically naming the transfer of ""dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defence sector"" — in NATO's first explicit accusation that the administration of Xi Jinping is providing military aid to Moscow. ""It's the first time that NATO allies state this so clearly in an agreed document,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a Wednesday address. ""It cannot continue like this without it impacting the interests and reputation of China."" NATO has been deeply entrenched in its support for non-member Ukraine since the dawns of Russia's invasion, widely viewing Moscow as a potential threat to broader European security. Beijing has previously repeatedly denied supplying weapons to Russia in the war in Ukraine, but the two nations have maintained close trade relations throughout the conflict, even as Moscow finds itself increasingly divorced from or outright sanctioned by the West. A CNBC analysis last year found that Moscow was at the time sourcing semiconductors and other advanced Western technologies through intermediary countries, including China. Earlier this week, Beijing started joint military exercises with Russia's close ally Belarus at a training ground mere miles away from the Polish border, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said in a Google-translated Telegram post. The territory of Belarus previously served as a launching pad for Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine. On the February 2023 first-year anniversary of the Ukraine war, China — which a month later successfully capitalized on goodwill earned as a trade partner to broker a reconciliation between arch-enemies Iran and Saudi Arabia — pitched a peace framework for the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv. It, like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's peace plan and Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin's own recent conditions to ignite diplomatic negotiations, has so far failed to gain traction. Earlier this week, China was the third stop in the world tour of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a crucial Putin ally who debuted his self-declared ""peace mission"" to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. After visiting Ukraine and Russia, Orban met with Xi in Beijing, praising China as a ""key power"" to resolve the hostilities. After years of a velvet-gloved diplomacy and approaching China as a distant concern, NATO on Wednesday said Beijing ""continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security,"" underscoring the alleged disinformation stemming from the world's second-largest economy and its activities in space and cyberspace. Back in March, NATO members the U.S. and U.K. accused China of a years-long cyberespionage campaign against politicians, businesses and journalists. The practices exposed ""China's continuous and brash efforts to undermine our nation's cybersecurity and target Americans and our innovation,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said at the time. In response, the Chinese embassy to the U.K. condemned Britain's ""sinister action."" ""The UK's claim that China was responsible for malicious cyber campaigns targeting the U.K. is completely unfounded and constitutes malicious slander,"" it said at the time. NATO also raised alarms over China's alleged nuclear ambitions. ""The PRC continues to rapidly expand and diversify its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems. We urge the PRC to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions and promote stability through transparency,"" the NATO communique said, warning that allies are simultaneously raising their ""shared awareness"" and enhancing preparations to protect against China's ""coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance."" The Federation of American Scientists estimates that China has a total inventory of 500 warheads as of March — a mere 9% of the arsenal of Russia, which possesses the largest nuclear capabilities after inheriting the reserves of the former Soviet Union. ""China is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country,"" Hans Kristensen, associate senior fellow at the Stockholm International Peach Research Institute said back in June, when the institute released its yearly publication analyzing world nuclear powers. ""The Chinese nuclear stockpile is projected to continue growing over the coming decade and the number of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) is likely to reach or even exceed the numbers held by either the Russian Federation or the United States,"" SPRI found last month. CNBC has reached out to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a scathing riposte, China's mission to the European Union said that the NATO statement ""hypes up China-Russia relations undercutting and reshaping the rules-based international order"" and is ""filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric."" It added, ""The China-related paragraphs are provocative with obvious lies and smears. We firmly reject and deplore these accusations and have lodged serious representations with NATO."" The NATO comments to China come after the leaders of several Indo-Pacific countries — such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea — are attending the Washington NATO summit, according to Reuters, extending a practice that began after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"Biden announces new NATO aid for Ukraine, as his reelection campaign teeters ","Biden announces new NATO aid for Ukraine, as his reelection campaign teeters                                                                                                                      President Joe Biden announced new commitments to help Ukraine bolster its air defense against Russia in a speech Tuesday commemorating NATO’s 75th anniversary. “Putin wants nothing less — nothing less — than Ukraine’s total subjugation, to end Ukraine’s democracy,” Biden said. “We know Putin won’t stop at Ukraine. But make no mistake: Ukraine can and will stop Putin, especially with our full collective support.” The aid will include new batteries and components for Patriot missile systems, donated by the U.S., Germany, Romania, the Netherlands and other partners. Italy will donate an additional SAMP-T missile system. Speaking from a teleprompter, Biden said that more air defense supplies will be distributed to Ukraine in the coming months. The announcement comes over two years into brutal invasion of Ukraine led by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a war that has become a point of contention on Capitol Hill as lawmakers remain divided on whether to keep providing funds for Ukraine’s defense. Biden’s speech also served as the latest example of the split screen looming over the 2024 NATO summit this week: As the president holds high-stakes meetings with foreign allies, his political future in the U.S. Democratic Party is on the line. The president’s Tuesday remarks were another opportunity for him to assuage Democratic fears about his 2024 candidacy, following his disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump in June. Since then, cracks have emerged within the Democratic Party as some lawmakers, donors and strategists publicly urge Biden to bow out of the race and allow a new nominee to step forward. Earlier Tuesday, House Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., joined the growing tally of Democratic lawmakers officially calling on Biden to drop out. Others have expressed continued support for the president in public statements, while voicing their reservations behind closed doors. Even as some Democrats remain tight-lipped about their concern about the president’s electability, many have openly noted that this week’s NATO summit comes with added pressure given the looming reelection doubts. The summit presents a timely example of Democrats’ heightened anxieties about losing to Trump in November. The former president has said he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the 32-member military alliance if he won a second term. “Americans, they know we’re stronger with our friends and we understand this is a sacred obligation,” Biden said during his NATO speech. Since his June 27 debate fumble, Biden has held several public appearances to try and restore confidence in his candidacy, including a 22-minute interview with ABC News last Friday. So far, his public showings have not put Democrats’ worries to rest. “The president needs to engage in the kind of interaction with voters that will prove to those that are skeptical out there that he can do the job,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a Sunday broadcast interview about the week ahead. “If he can’t do that, then he has a decision to make.” Biden is scheduled to hold a solo press conference on Thursday evening, a highly anticipated opportunity for him to prove that he can carry on an exchange with reporters in an unscripted environment.

Iran has voted in a reformist president — but change remains distant,"Daunting task ahead for Iran’s reformist president-elect  Advertisement Despite apprehension of a staged presidential election in Iran with candidates picked by a small, opaque panel loyal to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reformist Masoud Pezeshkian won the runoff by an impressive margin of 2.8 crore votes. At 49.8 percent, the polling percentage, too, was 10 points higher than in the first round, indicating people’s yearning for a moderate regime. The turnout in the first phase included as many as 10 lakh invalid votes, often seen by analysts as an indication of voter disillusionment. That Pezeshkian was allowed to contest in the first place—wannabe reformists were weeded out in the last presidential race in 2021—indicated Khamenei was aware of the national pulse and let it find expression as a safety valve, since the remote control was anyway in his hands. National unrest had peaked under the watch of hardliner Ebrahim Raisi, who had won in 2021. His death in a helicopter crash last May forced the snap election. Pezeshkian knows he will have little say in foreign policy to begin with, as it is controlled by Khamenei. So, arming Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon, Hamas in Israel and Houthis in Yemen to wage a proxy war for Shia supremacy may continue. Iran is also supplying drones to Russia to fight Ukraine. Besides, the country has eased ties with Saudi Arabia and China. Yet, the president-elect wants to re-engage with the West as Iranian inflation is at a whopping 40 per cent because of the crippling sanctions. He has the support of pragmatic, seasoned politicians like former foreign minister Javad Zarif, who successfully negotiated the nuclear deal with US President Barack Obama’s regime in 2015. However, his diplomatic outreach could flounder if Donald Trump returns as president. As for India, ties are expected to flourish seamlessly, with infrastructure projects like the Chabahar port continuing unimpeded. The visible change would be at home, where the despicable hijab policing will definitely be eased, letting women choose their attire. Similarly, internet clampdown could be relaxed to allow some freedom of expression. Police repression against protesters may also end. However, Pezeshkian’s ability to quickly release political prisoners would test his clout. The president-elect is a cardiac surgeon by training. Whether he can ease the stress on the nation’s heart by removing debilitating blocks in its arteries and making it more humane remains to be seen.

French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to tender resignation,"French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to tender resignation                                                                                                                      French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would submit his resignation on Monday, after early poll data showed his and French President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Ensemble party and its allies coming in second in the parliamentary runoff. Ensemble and its allies are projected to secure between 150 and 180 seats, according to an IFOP estimate, behind the leading New Popular Front’s 180-215 result. Both factions have outpaced the winner of the first parliamentary vote, the far-right Rassemblement National — RN or National Rally. France now looks likely to be stranded in a hung-parliament scenario that divides it between three strongly represented parties that must broker alliances to gain absolute control. Attal, who stepped in as France’s youngest ever prime minister only in January, is unlikely to hold the country’s second-highest position as part of the upcoming administration. “Faithful to the Republican tradition and in accordance with my principles, tomorrow morning I will submit my resignation to the president of the Republic,” Attal said Sunday, according to a CNBC translation. “I know that, in light of the results of this evening, many French people feel a certain uncertainty about the future, as no absolute majority has emerged [in parliament]. Our country is experiencing an unprecedented political situation,” Attal added His departure was widely expected in the wake of the first presidential vote, when analysts had circulated the possibility that Macron would have to concede the prime minister’s office to RN leader Jordan Bardella, if the far right retained its advance. “From the beginning of this campaign, I was alerted to three risks: the risk of an absolute majority dominated by the France Unbowed, the risk of an absolute majority dominated by Rassemblement National, and the risk of the disappearance of a movement that embodies our ideas and our values,” Attal said Sunday night. “These three risks, today, were discarded by the French people. Tonight, no absolute majority can be led by the extremes.” In light of the run-off results, Attal set the scene for a period of transition for France’s political landscape: “Ladies and gentlemen, this evening, a new era begins. A new era for our nation,” he said. Faced with uncertainty in one of Europe’s forefront economies, markets will be following the next few days for indications of what alliances will forge to achieve ruling majority. France’s leadership is unlikely to be entirely dismantled in the wake of the elections, as Macron has previously indicated he would serve out the remainder of his term until 2027, irrespective of the outcome of the vote.

‘A kind of civil war’: Divided France on alert for unrest amid political earthquake,"'A kind of civil war': Divided France on alert for unrest amid political earthquake                                                                                                                      ""We're scared of what might happen,"" Amel, 34, told CNBC ahead of the final round of voting in France's snap election this weekend. The vote is being closely watched by all quarters of French society to see if the nationalist, anti-immigration National Rally (RN) builds on its initial win in the first round of voting, or whether centrist and leftwing parties have been able to thwart the party's chances of entering government. ""It's a very, very tense time. And it's the first time that the far right is winning at the first turn [the first round of the ballot]. So it's a very big deal,"" Amel, a therapist who said she will vote for the leftwing New Popular Front, added. ""We are very anxious and we are trying to get everyone to vote, trying to tell people who don't vote to go and vote, and to try to convince people who vote for the extreme right that they are not a good answer [to France's problems]."" France's far-right RN rejects the ""extremist"" label, saying it stands up for French values, culture and citizens at a time when many are fed up with France's political establishment that's been led by President Emmanuel Macron since 2017. But RN's opponents and critics warn France is on the brink of a political catastrophe if an overtly anti-immigration, nationalist and euroskeptic party wins a majority in this snap election called by Macron after his party lost heavily against the hard-right in European Parliament elections in June. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has said French voters now have a ""moral duty"" to halt the party's advance. For young, left-leaning voters like Amel, RN's surge in voter polls, and the fact it won the most votes in the first round of the election last weekend, are worrying developments that make them fear for France's societal cohesion. ""I am worried about the country's future. I think it's getting worse and worse,"" Amel, who preferred to only give her first name due to the sensitive nature of the situation, said. ""It's going be like a kind of civil war. I hope it will not reach that, but people will just not mix anymore and will be scared of each other. And this is very scary."" The snap election has thrown the country's political polarization into sharp relief as polls ahead of the final round of voting on Sunday imply a deeply divided nation. The first round of the election resulted in the far-right RN winning 33% of the vote, with the leftwing New Popular Front (NFP) garnering 28% and the coalition of parties supporting Macron (Ensemble, or Together) winning 20% of the vote. Since the results of the first ballot, parties on the center-right and left have gone all-out to prevent RN's advance in the second ballot, aiming to prevent a parliamentary majority for the party at all costs. Joining forces in a so-called ""Republican Front,"" centrists and leftwing parties have withdrawn candidates in many constituencies where one of their candidates was better placed to beat the RN. By offering voters a starker choice and fewer options, the anti far-right front hopes that the electorate will vote for the non-RN candidate. Whether it will work remains to be seen and analysts point out that French voters might not take kindly to being directed how to vote, or who to vote for. The final result on Sunday evening — the outcome of a snap election Macron did not need to call — will show just how hard it could be to find a consensus in national politics and government going forward. How the nation will react to the result is also uncertain. France is no stranger to civil unrest given the widespread ""Yellow Vest"" anti-government movement of recent years, and street protests since the first round of voting on June 30. France's Interior Ministry appears to be preparing for more trouble after Sunday's poll, reportedly ready to deploy around 30,000 officers across France on Sunday night amid fears of violence after polls close. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin is reported to have said 5,000 police would be on duty in Paris and its surrounding areas to ""ensure that the radical right and radical left do not take advantage of the situation to cause mayhem."" France's police force has, at times, been accused of being heavy-handed with demonstrators during previous periods of unrest, firing water cannon and tear gas at ""yellow vest"" demonstrators in 2019.  A member of the gendarmerie, France's military force in charge of law enforcement and public order, told CNBC that the ""French elections are a mess"" and that the ""public divide has rarely been so flagrant in France."" ""People's opinions are becoming more and more divided and this is felt in everyday life,"" the gendarme, who asked to remain anonymous due to the nature of his job, told CNBC. The officer — a father of three who's in his 40s, and a right-leaning voter — said the polarization in French society was ""very worrying, but unfortunately normal with the 'diversity' of our society."" ""More and more people with different values and educations are being forced to co-exist, and this clearly doesn't work,"" the officer, who works in Bordeaux in southwestern France, said. ""I am worried about the country's future, because we are too generous to people who aren't willing to integrate and contribute to our society, this can not last."" The police officer said he expected civil unrest after the vote, whichever party gained the most votes. ""There will be civil unrest whoever is elected, this is France and the people speak their mind."" Political experts agree that the current febrile atmosphere of French politics, and antagonism between the main bodies of voters, are the ingredients for further civil unrest. ""You've got here all the recipe for a super-polarized political scene and that, of course, translates into civil society as a whole,"" Philippe Marlière, professor of French and European politics at University College London, told CNBC. ""If you've got only 33-34% of people voting for the far-right it means the rest is wary of that, or completely opposed to it, so that will translate on every level of politics — institutional politics, party politics, the National Assembly, but also in society. You will have a very polarized society in which younger people, ethnic minorities, women, and in particular feminists, would be very worried,"" he said. Marlière did not discount the possibility of violence on the streets if a far-right party was elected to government. ""We're not there yet. But if there are very unpopular, very antagonizing and very hostile policies to some groups, there will be demonstrations on a scale that you have unrest in the street,"" he said. Like other hard-right parties in Europe, the National Rally has tapped into voter insecurities regarding crime, immigration, national identity and economic insecurity. RN's 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella has told voters he will ""restore order,"" curb immigration and tackle delinquency but he and party figurehead Marine Le Pen have rowed back on some of their more strident promises and rhetoric, back-pedaling over taking France out of NATO, for example, and moderating the party's traditionally pro-Russian stance. Bardella said he would still support the sending of arms to Ukraine but not the deployment of ground troops, as Macron suggested was a possibility. It's uncertain how many of National Rally's policies would be enacted even if the party made it into government. The ""Republican Front"" also appears confident ahead of the second round of voting that its strategy to hurt the RN's vote share is working. An opinion poll published by Ifop on July 3 suggested voters might tend toward a centrist pro-Macron or leftwing candidate rather than the RN candidate if that is the choice they are presented with on the ballot paper on Sunday. If the choice was between a far-left and far-right candidate, however, the picture was more nuanced, showing a split vote. Analysts predict that RN is less likely to be able to achieve an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, but is still likely to gather the most votes, creating a hung parliament scenario and headache for Macron and uncertainty for France's political and economic outlook. ""The political landscape is in turmoil and can't really work any longer, at least not by the old rules,"" Ipsos analyst Mathieu Doiret told CNBC Thursday. ""We are in a situation so far from our traditions and political habitus that it's very difficult to adapt to this new situation for every stakeholder."" Got a confidential news tip?

Putin’s Hungarian ally Orban draws EU ire over ‘peace mission’ to Moscow,"Putin's Hungarian ally Orban draws EU ire over 'peace mission' to Moscow                                                                                                                      Russia's closest European ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has drawn ire from the EU over his Friday trip to meet Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Orban, whose country assumed the European Union's rotating presidency on July 1, is a self-declared ""peacemaker"" whose administration has repeatedly opposed — but mostly allowed to pass — EU and NATO military and financial aid measures in support of war-torn neighbor Ukraine. Hungary has retained working relations with Russia despite most other Western countries completely cutting ties with the nation in response to its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Setting a landmark precedent, NATO last month agreed to allow Budapest's nonparticipation in the coalition's deepening support of Ukraine — in exchange for Hungary not blocking such initiatives. Hungary will soon become the only country in Europe able to carry out dialogue with both Russia and Ukraine, Orban told Putin during the Friday visit, according to comments reported by Reuters and Russian state news agency Tass. The trip to Moscow is the second stop on Orban's self-described ""peace mission,"" after the Hungarian leader carried out his first wartime visit to Ukraine on Tuesday to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. After the engagement, Zelenskyy said that the pair had held talks over ""the most fundamental issues of our neighborly relations – trade, cross-border cooperation, infrastructure, and energy,"" and noted that the dialogue could set the foundation for ""a new bilateral document"" between the two nations. Orban also stressed Budapest's intentions to improve ties with Ukraine, while calling on Zelenskyy to consider a cease-fire in the hostilities with Russia in a bid to accelerate peace talks, Reuters reported. ""You cannot make peace from a comfortable armchair in Brussels,"" Orban said Friday in a social media post. ""Even if the rotating EU-Presidency has no mandate to negotiate on behalf of the EU, we cannot sit back and wait for the war to miraculously end. We will serve as an important tool in making the first steps towards #peace. This is what our peace mission is about."" Several peace initiatives have been floated — including Zelenskyy's 10-point plan, a Chinese proposal and Putin's own conditions to entertain negotiations — without gaining traction. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said Kyiv was not advised of Orban's trip to Moscow, which was made ""without agreement or coordination with Ukraine,"" according to a Google-translated statement. ""We remind you that for our country the principle of 'no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine' remains inviolable and we call on all countries to strictly adhere to it,"" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said, adding that the ""only realistic way to restore a just peace"" remains Zelenskyy's peace formula. Orban's trip to Moscow has also drawn the wrath of European officials, who questioned his authority to represent the bloc. EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell on Friday said the trip falls ""exclusively, in the framework of the bilateral relations between Hungary and Russia,"" stressing that Orban does not represent the European bloc in this engagement. Also referencing Orban's visit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that ""appeasement will not stop Putin. Only unity and determination will pave the path to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine."" Under the EU's guidelines, the bloc's rotating six-month presidency ""chairs meetings at every level in the Council, helping to ensure the continuity of the EU's work in the Council."" Orban assumed the post earlier this week with a goal to ""make Europe great again"" — a tagline reminiscent of the 2016 campaign slogan of former U.S. President Donald Trump.

Iran elects reformist Masoud Pezeshkian in presidential runoff vote,"Iran elects reformist Masoud Pezeshkian in presidential runoff vote                                                                                                                      Iran elected Masoud Pezeshkian to its presidency, in an unexpected victory for the country's reformist camp amid deep social discontent, economic hardship, and regional war. Pezeshkian won 16.3 million votes, according to reports which cited the local authorities, with the election seeing a 49.8% turnout. His rival Saeed Jalili, a hard-line right-wing former nuclear negotiator, finished the race with 13.5 million votes. The 69-year-old Pezeshkian managed to defeat several other candidates, all of whom were stanchly conservative, even as many analysts described him as the ""token reformist"" and a ""second-tier candidate"" in the contender pool with little name recognition. The most moderate of the candidates, he formerly served as minister of health under Iran's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, from 1997 to 2005, and Khatami among other reformist politicians endorsed him.   Pezeshkian has also been a member of parliament since 2008, and is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of parliament. He wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially restarting nuclear talks with world powers. Pezeshkian will serve for four years as the head of government for the Islamic Republic, and faces no shortage of challenges. The country of 88 million has for years endured a battered economy, harsh crackdowns on dissent, high inflation, and heavy Western sanctions. It also faces mounting tensions with the U.S. over Tehran's ramped-up Iranian nuclear enrichment and the Israel-Hamas war. The new Iranian president will have to contend with whoever takes the White House in November. This raises the stakes for both Tehran and Washington, as well as the Middle East writ large, as Iran comes closer than ever to nuclear bomb-production capability and continues to back proxy groups fighting Israel. On issues of foreign policy and war, the Iranian president wields some influence and is the country's public-facing messenger. But power and critical decision-making in Iran ultimately lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and unelected institutions like the Revolutionary Guards. ""While the election could lead to shifts in the priorities, tone and tactics of Iran's domestic and foreign policies, a fundamental change in the status quo is unlikely,"" Sina Toossi, a senior non-resident fellow at the Center for International Policy, told CNBC. ""The core principles guiding Iran's strategic decisions, particularly concerning the U.S. and Israel, are firmly rooted in the broader framework set by the Supreme Leader and influential bodies like the Revolutionary Guard,"" he said. Pezeshkian's victory ""could open avenues for renewed diplomatic engagements and slightly more progressive domestic policies. However,"" Toossi said, ""even with a reformist president, the extent of change would be limited by the overarching power structures and strategic imperatives that define Iran's political landscape. Thus, any real change would likely be gradual and incremental rather than transformative."" Iran's election was held following the unexpected death of former President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May. Iran's elections are not considered to be free or fair, as the country's ultra-conservative Guardian Council ultimately decides who is allowed to run on the ballot in the first place. Voting was open to roughly 61 million eligible Iranians, but many pledged to boycott, pointing out the lack of genuine choice for voters.  The council only approved six candidates to run for the presidency for this election out of a list of 80 registrants, and all the female registrants were disqualified. Of the six candidates approved, five were hard-line conservatives and three had been sanctioned by Western governments. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Britain’s Labour pulled off a thumping election victory with just 34% of the national vote,"Britain's Labour pulled off a thumping election victory with just 34% of the national vote                                                                                                                      LONDON — The U.K.'s Labour Party won a huge parliamentary majority in the country's general election, but a quirk of the British electoral system means it did so with just 34% of the total votes cast. Results show that the opposition Labour Party has won 412 parliamentary seats of the total 650, with just two seats yet to be declared. This translates as roughly 63% of the total seats, but Labour has won just 34% of the total ""popular"" vote, while the Conservative Party has secured nearly 24% of that number. Meanwhile, smaller parties including the centrist Liberal Democrats, right-wing Reform U.K. and the Greens took nearly 43% of the popular vote but gained just less than 18% of the seats available. This was aided by the U.K.'s ""first past the post"" system, where voters choose only one single candidate from their local list in each of the country's 650 constituencies. The person with the most votes in each constituency is elected as a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons, the U.K.'s lower house. The party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons usually forms the new government and its leader becomes prime minister. Unlike in other voting systems, there are no second rounds or ranking of first- and second-choice candidates, meaning it can be difficult for smaller parties to translate an increased share of the popular vote into parliamentary seats. Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at AXA Investment Managers, said in a note released Friday that this election ""marks a warning sign for the political system, [as] a large majority has been delivered on a little more than a third of the popular vote."" She pointed out that voter turnout was just 60% for this election. That represents the second-lowest turnout rate since 1918, after 2001, when turnout fell to 59.4%. This 7.6% fall in turnout from 2019 indicated a ""broader political disconnect,"" said Dickens. ""The scale of Labour's majority is as much an outcome of the peculiarities of our voting system and an interplay of split votes and the [collapse of the] Scottish National Party (SNP), rather than of a resurgence in Labour's popularity,"" she said. That said, Dickens added that the ""vote has shifted to the left more generally."" ""If the Labour government can govern over the next five years and deliver a recovery in economic growth, investment and individuals' real incomes they should be well placed ... to see a genuine improvement in the future,"" she said. Meanwhile, Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Marcoeconomics, said that investors will need to ""chew over how the vote shares, right-wing Reform's results, and voters' willingness to shift political allegiance translates into policy."" Nigel Farage's Reform UK party won 14% of the popular vote, securing just four seats. Wood said: ""Normally a majority as large as Labour's would guarantee more than one term as government. But Mr. Starmer's majority is not as secure as normal given the voting dynamics."" He said that Labour ""will likely need to move fast with policy changes to demonstrate they can deliver their promised changes."" — CNBC's Jenni Reid and Holly Ellyatt contributed to this report.

China faces economic headwinds as it grapples with an aging — and shrinking — population,"China’s population is shrinking, and the demographic shift will ultimately hurt its economy, shrink the labor force and put pressure on fiscal policy. “The working age population [in China] will fall so rapidly over the next decade, that the Chinese economy will need to deal with 1% drag in GDP growth per year for next 10 years,” Darren Tay, head of Asia country risk at BMI Country Risk & Industry Analysis, told “Squawk Box Asia” in June, referring to estimates gathered by evaluating world population data released by the United Nations. “The fiscal strain as a result of ageing is immediate and concerning,” the Economist Intelligence Unit has warned. “Economic growth hinges on productivity, capital accumulation and labour inputs. The negative effect of an adverse demographic landscape will manifest primarily through a shrinking workforce,” according to the report published in January. Raising the retirement age is “one of the few viable options” to maintain long-term fiscal balance, the EIU said. “Our calculations suggest that if the retirement age is raised to 65 by 2035, the pension budget shortfall could be reduced by 20% and received net pension can be increased by 30%, suggesting relief of both government and household burden,” according to the report. Birth rates are falling around the world as women choose to have children later, or not at all. Fertility rates have halved across OECD countries — some of the world’s richest nations — falling from about 3.3 children per woman in 1960 to about 1.5 children per woman in 2022, according to the OECD, or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. “This is significantly below the ‘replacement level’ of 2.1 children per woman needed to keep population constant in the absence of migration,” according to the June report. China’s population fell for a second consecutive year in 2023 to 1.409 billion people — dropping by 2.08 million from the previous year, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. That’s more than the population decline of about 850,000 in 2022 — the first year deaths outnumbered births in the country since the early 1960s during the Great Famine. “This is a consequence of the one-child policy [set] in place [in] the 1980s,” Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank, told CNBC. China’s population is expected to shrink to 1.317 billion by 2050, and drop by nearly half — to 732 million — by 2100. Fertility rate in the country is dropping more quickly than its regional peers like South Korea and Japan, Tianchen Xu, a senior economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), told CNBC. He said the three countries are disproportionately impacted by a rapidly aging population, largely due to improved standards of living, which have a “very strong inverse relationship with fertility rates.” China, in particular, has been “growing at a very high rate for nearly three decades.” and its economic expansion has been “rapid and extended,” he added. The country’s welfare system has also “lagged” and fiscal support for childbearing is “quite low by international comparison,” according to Xu. Surging home prices are not helping. “The government has largely been incapable of managing the significant rising housing costs,” according to Xu, who pointed out that as housing becomes increasingly costly, people may find it difficult to purchase homes and delay starting a family. The rapid economic expansion seen in recent decades in developed nations has brought about rising income levels and the broadening of educational and career opportunities for women. These improved conditions have led to a greater opportunity cost for having children, Xu said. “In more developed societies, the tendency is that parents face a much higher cost of raising children, and that tends to be a deterrent to having [them],” said BMI’s Tay. “The more developed an economy is, the more skills the actors in the economy have to have, and thus, the required investment in each [child] rises by that amount,” he said. The work culture in Asia can also play a part. “Among the Asian countries, there’s the entrenched mindset of working long hours,” said Xu, which is “particularly an issue in China, South Korea… [and] other parts of East and Southeast Asia.” “These countries are where the aggregate working hours are the longest in the world,” and as a result, workers have less time to build a family, Xu told CNBC. A decline in fertility rate puts pressure on the economy and the society at large as the working population shrinks. “A country’s birth rates will translate into its working age population growth, some two decades down the road,” said Tay from Maybank.. Additionally, falling fertility rates can impact the ratio of elderly folks who need support from younger generations, which can put “excessive burdens on a country’s health care and pension systems,” Maybank’s Tay told CNBC. Ultimately, the burden on younger generations will grow as they need to care not only for their own children, but for their elderly parents as well. This demographic shift in parts of Asia is a structural issue that will require “determined and holistic government effort,” on both fiscal and monetary policy, she said. In China, policymakers have been putting a big emphasis on “productivity growth,” Xu told CNBC. “They have [seen] that there’s a very big decline in the labor contribution to GDP, [which] cannot be mitigated via any sort of policy intervention in the short term,” he said. “That’s why they have been focusing on their productivity growth.” The country has invested heavily into shifting to digital solutions and developing technologies such automation and advanced chips, said Xu, with the goal of making traditional industries more efficient, and overall, improving productivity. Looking ahead, Chinese policymakers are encouraged to do more about the labor environment. “That probably entails tighter enforcement of the labor law and promoting work-life balance,” said Xu. Economists also agree that Chinese policymakers should also work to raise the retirement age in the country, create more aggressive tax rebates for costs associated with child-rearing, and step-up its efforts in constructing affordable housing in the country. Despite the slowdown in growth expected in China due to its demographics issue, the country’s GDP has grown an average of 9% per year since 1978, according to the World Bank. Ultimately, “the fact remains that growth of even around 3% would not be, by any stretch of the imagination, a disaster for the Chinese economy,” Tay from BMI told CNBC. “If they would continue to grow at that pace, which probably would be more sustainable, the average Chinese citizen would be in real terms, better off in income by 13% by 2033,” he added. “So living standards would still continue to rise.” Get the best of CNBC Africa sent straight to your inbox with breaking business news, insights and updates from experts across the continent.

"Japan’s Nikkei logs worst day since 1987 Black Monday crash on Aug 4, 2024.","Japan's Nikkei logs worst day since 1987 Black Monday crash                                                                                                                      Japan stocks confirmed a bear market on Monday as Asia-Pacific markets continued the sell-off from last week, with the Nikkei 225 and Topix dropping over 12%. The benchmark indexes have fallen more than 20% from their all-time highs on July 11. The 12.4% loss on the Nikkei — which saw it close at 31,458.42 — was the worst day for the index since the ""Black Monday"" of 1987. The loss of 4,451.28 points on the index was also the largest in terms of points in its entire history. The Nikkei erased all its gains so far this year, moving into a loss position. The broad-based Topix also saw a rout as it tumbled 12.23% and closed at 2,227.15. Heavyweight trading houses such as Mitsubishi , Mitsui and Co , Sumitomo and Marubeni all plunged over 14%, with Mitsui losing almost 20% of its market cap. Monday's decline follows Friday's rout when Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix fell more than 5% and 6%, respectively. In Monday trading, the yen also strengthened to its strongest level against the dollar since January, and was last trading at 142.09. South Korea's Kospi fell 8.77%, closing at 2,441.55, and the small-cap Kodaq tumbled 11.3%, ending at 691.28. Due to the magnitude of the sell-off, the exchanges hit circuit breakers, halting trade for the Kospi index at 2.14 p.m. Seoul time and at 1.56 p.m. for the Kosdaq. The halt was for 20 minutes. Circuit breakers are activated if stocks rise or fall 8%. Investors, meanwhile, awaited key trade data from China and Taiwan this week, a well as central bank decisions from Australia and India. China's service sector expanded at a faster pace in July, with the country's purchasing managers' index climbing to 52.1 in July, up from 51.2 in June. The Caixin survey said the acceleration of growth was due to faster new business growth, ""supported by sustained improvements in underlying demand conditions and an expansion of services offerings."" Taiwan's benchmark index, the Taiwan Weighted Index , was down over 8%, dragged by tech and real estate stocks , while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 3.7% to 7,649.6. The Reserve Bank of Australia kicks off its two-day monetary policy meeting Monday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the central bank to hold rates steady at 4.35%, but markets will monitor the monetary policy statement for clarity on whether the RBA is still considering a rate hike. Hong Kong Hang Seng index was down 1.62% as of its final hour of trade, while mainland China's CSI 300 fell 1.21% to 3,343.32, seeing the smallest loss in Asia. On Friday in the U.S., stocks fell sharply as a much weaker-than-anticipated jobs report for July ignited worries that the economy could be falling into a recession. The Nasdaq was the first of the three major benchmarks to enter correction territory, down more than 10% from its record high. The S&P 500 and Dow were 5.7% and 3.9% below their all-time highs, respectively. The S&P 500 dropped 1.84%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 610.71 points, or 1.51%. —CNBC's Pia Singh and Hakyung Kim contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Delta CEO offers employees free flights after CrowdStrike-Microsoft chaos,"Delta CEO offers employees free flights after CrowdStrike-Microsoft chaos                                                                                                                      In this article Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian on Friday offered employees two free travel passes to thank staff members who were caught in massive disruptions last month sparked by a botched CrowdStrike software update that stranded thousands of customers and crew. Delta had more trouble than competitors in recovering from the outages that took thousands of Windows machines offline around the world, affecting industries from health care to banking. The carrier canceled more than 5,000 flights between July 19 and July 24, more than it did in all of 2019, according to FlightAware. Bastian said earlier this week that the incident cost the company about $500 million, a sum that is equal to about 40% of Delta's second-quarter profit. A crew-tracking platform was a contributor to the cancellations and disruptions, the airline has said. Delta told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday that the airline had to manually reset 40,000 servers. The disruption ""has been a humbling moment for our company,"" Bastian said in his note on Friday, which was seen by CNBC. ""I know it's been extremely difficult, and I'm deeply sorry for what you have endured. An operational disruption of this length and magnitude is simply unacceptable — you and our customers deserve better."" Upward of 4,000 Delta flight attendants picked up more than 6,100 trips during the disruptions, receiving extra pay, according to another Delta staff memo on Friday. ""Your efforts throughout have been nothing short of heroic,"" Bastian told staff. The two ""positive space"" passes Bastian offered employees are confirmed seats like a customer would have, different from the free standby flying airline employees often do if there are available seats. The Delta organizing committee of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which is in the middle of a campaign to unionize Delta's flight attendants, said the offer of passes ""just isn't going to cut it."" The organizing committee, in a written statement, said airline management routinely makes ""meager adjustments to keep the operation running without making changes significant enough to prevent a future meltdown."" Delta's operation has since stabilized but the flight cancellations and delays stranded thousands and scarred Delta's high reliability standings. Its executives frequently point out Delta's successful work to win over both leisure and corporate customers who are willing to pay more to fly the carrier, marketing itself as a premium airline. A Delta spokesman earlier this week said the airline has processed ""thousands"" of refunds and reimbursement requests.  The U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating Delta's disruptions, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said last week. Similar disruptions at other carriers, such as the massive 2022 holiday meltdown at Southwest Airlines after winter storms, have highlighted how technology issues can severely disrupt air travel. Bastian said Delta plans to pursue legal action against CrowdStrike and Microsoft ""to recover our losses caused by the outage"" and that it has hired law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. Microsoft declined to comment. CrowdStrike said it has ""no knowledge of a lawsuit and have no further comment.""  Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Jeff Bezos’ family office is making big investments in AI,"Jeff Bezos' family office is making big investments in AI                                                                                                                      A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high net worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Jeff Bezos has been making headlines for his big-ticket purchases — from a $165 million estate in Los Angeles and a $177 million property on Miami's Indian Creek to his $500 million yacht. Yet, Bezos' biggest recent buying binge may be in artificial intelligence, through his family office. All of the investments made this year by Bezos' family office — called Bezos Expeditions — have been in artificial intelligence, according to exclusive data provided to CNBC by FINTRX, a private wealth intelligence platform. While the amounts he invested are not disclosed, Bezos Expeditions participated in funding rounds totaling more than $1 billion. In January, the Amazon founder and executive chairman invested in the $73.6 million Series B round of Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine company. He also invested in a $63 million follow-on round in April. The value of Bezos Expeditions' January investment likely doubled by April, since the company says its valuation soared to between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. In February, Bezos Expeditions invested in Figure AI, the humanoid-robot company that also counts Nvidia and Microsoft as investors. The venture round totaled $675 million. In July, he invested in a $300 million Series A round of Skild AI, which is focused on making AI systems for machines and robotics devices. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today. Bezos Expeditions has always tilted heavily toward tech. Fully 70% of his family office investments are in technology, according to FINTRX. The next-biggest category is consumer goods, at 16%, followed by financial services and manufacturing, both at 13%. But now, his primary focus seems to be AI. In a podcast interview in January, Bezos said AI tools are ""not inventions, but discoveries"" that will have profound effects on technology and change. ""These powerful tools are much more likely to help us and save us even than they are to unbalance, hurt us and destroy us,"" he said. Bezos has plenty of company among family offices. According to the UBS Global Family Office Report, AI is now the favorite investment category for family offices. More than three-quarters, or 78%, of family offices surveyed plan to invest in AI in the next two to three years — the most for any category. Amazon has also been ploughing money into AI. The company plans to invest more than $100 billion in data centers over the next decade and invested $4 billion in Anthropic, the AI safety and research firm. Bezos recently filed a stock-sale plan to unload another $5 billion worth of Amazon shares this year, after selling $8 billion worth earlier this year. With more than $13 billion in cash, Bezos will now have even more money to bet on the AI boom. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

DraftKings to tax winning bets in high-rate states in a bid to boost profit,"DraftKings to tax winning bets in high-rate states in a bid to boost profit                                                                                                                      In this article Mobile betting powerhouse DraftKings is planning a tax on consumers in states with the highest sports betting tax rates, as the company looks to boost profit. The company announced Thursday that starting next year, it will implement a gaming surcharge on winning bets in states with multiple betting operators and where the tax rate is above 20%. That includes Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. ""We decided that the best course of action is to do what really every other industry [does] — whether it's hotels, taxis — whatever else you buy generally has some kind of tax,"" DraftKings CEO and co-founder Jason Robins told CNBC. The announcement came as the sports betting operator released its second-quarter earnings, which marked the company's first-ever profitable quarter as a public company. DraftKings reported revenue of $1.1 billion, roughly in line with consensus estimates, according to LSEG. Fears of tax hikes in gaming pressured DraftKings stock and other betting companies such as FanDuel back in May, when Illinois approved a tax hike on sports betting revenue. The sliding tax rates impose 40% levies on companies with the largest adjusted gross revenue. New York and New Hampshire each maintain 51% tax rates on sports betting companies. In a letter to shareholders Thursday, Robins said the new surcharge will be nominal for the customer. In Illinois, for example, it will amount to a low- to mid-single-digit percentage of net winnings. ""If you made a $10 bet to win $20, you would pay like 30 cents,"" Robins said, citing an example. DraftKings is believed to be the first U.S. operator to implement a tax on the winnings of a bettor. Robins said he weighed it heavily and hopes it causes states to think twice about the tax rate. ""I do think that if states start to realize that above a certain level, we can't invest in our product and customer experience in the way that we need to … it might make them think differently about it,"" he added. He is also considering customers' response. ""We're not going to hide it,"" Robins said. ""Obviously, we could see some customers drop off, and player betting activity, if they don't like it."" Robins says DraftKings is not including the new tax in its guidance. The company raised revenue guidance to a range of $5.05 billion to $5.25 billion from previous guidance in the range of $4.80 billion to $5 billion. The updated guidance equates to 38% to 43% year-over-year growth. But the sports betting giant lowered its 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $340 million and $420 million, down from previous guidance of $460 million to $540 million. The company reported a profit during the second quarter for the first time, posting net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 of $63.8 million, or 10 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $77.3 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier.  Analysts surveyed by LSEG expected a per-share loss of 1 cent for the period. Revenue rose to $1.1 billion, up 26% from $874.9 million a year earlier. The company said the revenue increase was driven primarily by continued healthy customer engagement, expansion into new jurisdictions and the acquisition of lottery app Jackpocket. ""The overperformance that we are seeing with customer acquisition, the launch of Washington D.C., our expectation for Jackpocket to deliver positive EBITDA next year as well as underlying trends with our existing customers and our performance on the handle side, all should offset the Illinois tax increase next year,"" Robins said on the company's earnings call. ""So even if we don't get any benefit from the fee, we will see still $900 million to $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA next year."" More than 30 states now allow some form of sports wagering, and many of them permit mobile and online betting. DraftKings is live with mobile sports betting in 25 states and Washington, D.C. The company's iGaming division is live in five states. The company said so far this year, 10 more jurisdictions have either introduced legislation to legalize mobile sports betting or introduced a bill that may result in a mobile sports betting referendum during an upcoming election. DraftKings also announced its first ever $1 billion share repurchase program. The company has a market cap of about $14 billion. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Delta CEO says CrowdStrike-Microsoft outage cost the airline $500 million,"Delta's CEO says the CrowdStrike outage cost the airline $500 million in 5 days  By  Jason Breslow A Delta Air Lines jet takes off at the Los Angeles International Airport in April. Ed Bastian, the airline's CEO, says the CrowdStrike outage has cost the carrier $500 million. The CEO of Delta Air Lines says the massive CrowdStrike outage that hobbled its flight operations earlier this month, leaving thousands of passengers stranded, has cost the airline as much as $500 million. The outage hit Delta harder than most of its competitors. The airline was forced to cancel more than 5,000 flights as a result of the outage, which stymied businesses worldwide when a failed software update from CrowdStrike, a major cybersecurity firm, crashed operations for millions of users running Microsoft Windows devices. Speaking on CNBC on Wednesday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the airline is now preparing for litigation as it looks to recover from the outage. “We have no choice,” Bastian said about potential action against CrowdStrike. “We’re not looking to wipe them out, but we’re looking to make certain that we get compensated however they decide to for what they cost us. Half a billion dollars in five days.” In a public letter released earlier this month, Bastian said the software outage hit on what was the “busiest travel weekend of the summer” for the airline with the nation's third largest fleet size. It caused massive disruption to Delta's crew-tracking system, a mission critical tool used to pair pilots and flight attendants with flights. During his interview with CNBC, Bastian said Delta was heavily reliant on CrowdStrike and Microsoft for its cybersecurity. “We’re by far the heaviest in the industry with both, and so we got hit the hardest in terms of the recovery capability,” he said. To help get back online, the company had to manually reset 40,000 servers, according to Bastian. He said the Atlanta-based carrier is now back up and running and over the last seven days has had less than 100 cancellations in aggregate over 30,000 flights. Still, Delta has been left to recover from both a massive financial and reputational hit. It also faces an investigation by the U.S. Department of Transportation over its response to the outage. No suit has yet been filed by Delta, but Bastian’s comments could portend the start of a wave of litigation against CrowdStrike for the outage. Delta has already hired the prominent litigator David Boies, chairman of the firm Boies Schiller Flexner, in advance of a potential lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the decision who was not authorized to speak publicly. “If you’re going to be having access, priority access to the Delta ecosystem in terms of technology, you’ve got to test the stuff. You can’t come into a mission-critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug,” Bastian told CNBC. In a statement, a spokesperson for CrowdStrike said, “We are aware of the reporting, but have no knowledge of a lawsuit and have no further comment.""",True,False,False
Taco Bell to roll out AI drive-thru ordering in hundreds of locations by end of year,"Taco Bell to roll out AI drive-thru ordering in hundreds of locations by end of year                                                                                                                      In this article Yum Brands hopes to use artificial intelligence to take down drive-thru orders at hundreds of Taco Bell restaurants by the end of this year. The restaurant company announced on Wednesday that it is expanding its rollout of the tech in the U.S. as it eyes implementing it in drive-thru lanes globally. Yum Brands joins restaurant rivals such as Wendy’s and White Castle in betting on voice AI, but its plans are the most ambitious to date. While tech companies may promise that voice AI can speed up service times, reduce labor costs and boost sales through upselling, restaurant companies have taken a more measured approach so far, testing the tech to make sure both its employees and customers enjoy the experience. In June, McDonald’s said it would end its trial of Automated Order Taker, an AI technology tested in partnership with IBM. The Chicago-based company now plans to turn to other vendors instead. Yum Brands has moved quickly on its test. In May, executives said Taco Bell would expand its pilot of voice AI from five locations to 30 restaurants in California. Currently, more than 100 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. use voice AI. Taco Bell had nearly 7,700 U.S. locations at the end of 2023, according to company filings. Yum Brands said the tech has improved order accuracy, reduced wait times, decreased employees’ task load and fueled profitable growth for the restaurant company and its operators. “With over two years of fine tuning and testing the drive-thru Voice AI technology, we’re confident in its effectiveness in optimizing operations and enhancing customer satisfaction,” Yum Brands Chief Innovation Officer Lawrence Kim said in a statement. Five KFC restaurants in Australia are also testing voice AI tech in drive-thrus, Yum Brands said. Yum Brands is expected to report its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Got a confidential news tip?

"McDonald’s executives admit diners think prices are too high, say they’re working to create value","McDonald's executives admit diners think prices are too high, say they're working to create value                                                                                                                      In this article McDonald's executives acknowledged Monday that diners consider the company's prices too high as lower-income consumers balk after years of high inflation. During the company's second-quarter earnings call Monday, executives said they are taking a ""forensic approach"" to evaluating prices and trying to create value. The company posted worse-than expected second-quarter earnings as same-store sales declined across every division. ""We recognize that in several large markets, including the U.S., we have an opportunity to improve our value execution. Consumers still recognize us as the value leader versus our key competitors but it's clear that our value leadership gap has recently shrunk. We are working to fix that with pace,"" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call. Kempczinski said price increases have made consumers reconsider buying habits. As consumers pull back spending amid increasing prices, fast-food chains have had a difficult time drawing in lower-income diners. More than 60% of respondents to a recent LendingTree survey said they have cut back their fast-food spending because it is too expensive. McDonald's executives on the earnings call said lower-income diners have not been moving from the chain to other fast-food restaurants, but instead have been eating out less frequently across most of the company's markets globally. The company saw consumers pull back in not just the U.S. but globally, particularly families in European markets. ""At the end of the day, we expect customers will continue to feel the pinch of the economy and a higher cost of living for at least the next several quarters in this very competitive landscape,"" McDonald's U.S. President Joe Erlinger said. ""So we believe it is critical for us to consider these factors in order to grow market share, and return to sustainable guest count-led growth for the brand."" McDonald's last week decided to extend its $5 value meal offering past its initial four-week window, saying it brought customers back to its restaurants. Ninety-three percent of company franchisees committed to extending the offer further into the summer. June 25, the launch day of McDonald's $5 meal, drew 8% more visits than the average Tuesday in 2024 so far and the pattern repeated in the following days as the chain exceeded year-to-date daily visit averages, according to a report from Placer.ai. Erlinger said the number of $5 meal deals sold topped expectations. The rates were highest among lower-income consumers, and the deal improved brand perceptions around value affordability. The offer also began to increase guest count growth, but it has not yet translated into sales increases, company executives said on the call. The $5 value meal was rolled out only days before the second quarter ended. ""For 70 years we've led on value because it's what the brand stands for and frankly … we have an underlying competitive advantage that we can buy at a lower price than anybody else in our industry,"" Kempczinski said. ""The point is, we know how to do this. We wrote the playbook on value and we are working with our franchisees to make the necessary adjustments."" — CNBC's Amelia Lucas and Kate Rogers contributed reporting. Got a confidential news tip?

U.S. airlines cut growth plans in a bid to stem profit-eating fare discounts,"U.S. airlines cut growth plans in a bid to stem profit-eating fare discounts                                                                                                                      In this article U.S. airlines are reducing their capacity through the end of the year in a bid to cool an oversupplied domestic market that has led to lower fares and reduced profits despite strong summer travel demand. For passengers, that could mean higher fares are on the way. Over the last week, U.S. airlines had ""one of the industry's largest week-over-week capacity reductions,"" shaving almost 1% off of their capacity planned for the fourth quarter, Deutsche Bank said in a note Sunday. Airlines now expect to grow flying about 4% year over year during the final three months of the year. ""Despite the sizeable overall reduction, we expect to see further cuts in the weeks ahead as carriers are expected to continue to refine their schedules,"" Deutsche Bank airline analyst Michael Linenberg wrote in the note. U.S. airline executives have noted strong demand but a domestic market that's awash in flights, forcing them to dial back growth plans, which could drive up fares. The latest U.S. inflation report earlier this month showed airfare in June fell 5.1% from a year earlier and 5.7% from May. Reducing capacity could drive up fares for consumers and boost airlines' bottom lines, if travel demand holds up. Getting fares in the market that are profitable to airlines but palatable to consumers is crucial for the industry as consumers have pulled back on spending in other areas. Third-quarter outlooks from Delta and United earlier this month disappointed investors, but their CEOs said they expected capacity pullbacks across the U.S. industry to materialize in August, helping results. Southwest Airlines forecast a potential drop in third-quarter unit revenue, a measure of how much money an airline brings in for the amount it's flying. The airline said last week it will finally ditch its iconic open-seating model and introduce extra-legroom seats to drive up revenue. American Airlines on Thursday reported a 46% decline in its second-quarter profit and said it plans to dial back its capacity growth in the coming months, expanding less than 1% in September over last year. ""That excess capacity led to a higher level of discounting activity in the quarter than we had anticipated,"" CEO Robert Isom said on an earnings call last week. Overall, American plans to grow 3.5% in the second half of the year after expanding about 8% in the first six months of the year. Low-cost and discount airlines have been more aggressive in cutting unprofitable routes and scaling back capacity. Those carriers plan to contract 2.2% in the fourth quarter from the same period of 2023, Deutsche Bank said. JetBlue Airways , for example, has culled money-losing routes this year and deployed aircraft to more popular city pairs. The carrier is scheduled to report results before the market opens on Tuesday. Spirit Airlines , meanwhile, warned of a wider-than-expected loss for the second quarter after nonticket revenue, which accounts for fees like checked bags and seating assignments, came in lighter than expected.

"Deadpool & Wolverine’ snares $38.5 million in Thursday previews, on pace for record opening","'Deadpool & Wolverine' snares $38.5 million in Thursday previews, on pace for record opening                                                                                                                      In this article Disney and Marvel's ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" has secured $38.5 million in Thursday previews and is on pace for a domestic debut north of $150 million, which would be a record for an R-rated film. The latest entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of the most anticipated releases of 2024 and the first R-rated film in the comic book franchise. The preview haul was the eighth largest ever, and the highest for an R-rated release. ""Thursday previews have become an integral part of the release strategy for most major studio releases,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. ""Thursday previews not only provide early access to eager fans who can't wait to see the latest blockbuster on the big screen ahead of their official debut, but also provide a key indicator of the potential opening weekend box office to the studios, analysts and journalists alike."" Blockbuster comic book and franchise films often see significantly higher Thursday night ticket sales, as fans seek to see the film early on its opening weekend to avoid spoilers. Thursday night preview numbers are folded into Friday's box office haul and calculated as part of a film's three-day opening weekend. Source: Comscore, Disney ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is expected to tally between $160 million and $180 million at the domestic box office during its debut. This haul would mark the highest opening weekend for a film in 2024 and the biggest debut of an R-rated film ever. ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is the 34th film to be released under the MCU banner and the first to garner an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association. The previous two Deadpool films, both rated R, were produced and released through 20th Century Fox. Disney acquired the company in 2019, bringing the X-Men and Fantastic Four back into the larger Marvel portfolio. Movie theater operators told CNBC they do not expect the R-rating to deter moviegoers. In fact, it is likely a selling point for the film. ""'Deadpool & Wolverine' might prove to be a jack of all trades for Disney and Marvel after the studios eased off the gas pedal with fewer releases across theatrical and streaming recently,"" said Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory. ""That may be parlayed into renewed interest for this next event-level story, which also isn't meant to be a film requiring homework for the casual or uninitiated."" ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is the first MCU film to be released since November of last year and will be the only 2024 release from Marvel Studios. Currently, there are four MCU releases slated for 2025, one for 2026 and one for 2027. However, Marvel is set to present a panel at this weekend's San Diego Comic Con and during Disney's D23 Expo in August, so the calendar could be altered. Changes could come after the firing of Kang actor Jonathan Majors — who was set to play the major villain in the coming sequence of films — and production delays caused by last year's actors and writers strikes.

"Bristol Myers to Acquire Karuna, a Neuroscience Drugmaker, for $14 Billion","Bristol Myers to Acquire Karuna, a Neuroscience Drugmaker, for $14 Billion  ADVERTISEMENT  The deal is a bet on the growing market for psychiatric and neurological drugs. By Lauren Hirsch Bristol Myers Squibb, the global pharmaceutical giant, said on Friday that it would acquire Karuna Therapeutics, which makes drugs to treat schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s, in an all-cash deal valued at $14 billion as it looks to strengthen its pipeline of neuroscience drugs. Bristol Myers said in a statement that it would pay $330 per share in cash, a premium of roughly 53 percent to Karuna’s share price on Thursday. An increasing prevalence of schizophrenia, driven in part by an aging population, has led to a push to make more drugs to treat it. The market for such therapies is estimated to grow to $12.6 billion by 2032, according to the research firm Market.Us. Earlier this month, the biomedical company AbbVie bought Cerevel Therapeutics, which develops drugs to treat psychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease for about $8.7 billion. Karuna’s big bet on schizophrenia is the drug KarXT, which the Food and Drug Administration has accepted for review. The company said it expected to begin marketing the drug in September 2024, pending regulatory approval. ADVERTISEMENT “We expect KarXT to enhance our growth through the late 2020s and into the next decade,” Christopher Boerner, the chief executive of Bristol Myers Squibb, said in a statement. The boards of both companies unanimously approved the deal. Shares of Bristol Myers Squibb rose 2.5 percent in early trading, while Karuna’s stock jumped nearly 50 percent.

Whole Foods Wins Case About Black Lives Matter Apparel,"Whole Foods Wins Case About Black Lives Matter Apparel  ADVERTISEMENT  An administrative judge ruled that the chain did not break the law by forbidding employees to wear apparel showing support for Black Lives Matter. By Santul Nerkar Whole Foods did not violate the law when it punished employees for wearing apparel supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, a federal administrative judge ruled on Wednesday. The judge for the National Labor Relations Board, Ariel Sotolongo, said Whole Foods had not violated the labor rights of employees in 2020 when it disciplined them for wearing masks, pins and other accessories emblazoned with the “Black Lives Matter” slogan. The judge wrote that wearing the apparel was not connected “with their employment or working conditions.” The employees will be able to appeal the decision to the labor board. The case was brought in July 2020 by 14 employees in four states who said the grocery chain had illegally disciplined them while citing its dress code policy. The workers said they had been sent home without pay or fired for wearing apparel with the slogan. Whole Foods denied retaliating against employees. “Our diverse culture continues to be a source of great pride for Whole Foods Market, and we remain focused on creating both a safe and inclusive workplace for all,” the company said in a statement on Thursday. “We are pleased with the outcome of this case.” ADVERTISEMENT The lawyer representing the workers, Shannon Liss-Riordan, said she was disappointed by the ruling. “If employees have a good-faith belief that they are taking an action to promote and to improve the terms and conditions of their workplace, that is protected activity,” she said. One employee at a store in Cambridge, Mass., Savannah Kinzer, testified that she had decided to start wearing apparel with the Black Lives Matter slogan in June 2020 because other stores had sent employees home for wearing similar apparel, according to news articles she had read. Along with several dozen co-workers, Ms. Kinzer repeatedly wore a Black Lives Matter-themed mask from late June to early July. She and her colleagues were told that they were violating the company’s dress code and were dismissed early from their shifts, without pay. Eventually, she was fired after being late to work. Many companies embraced the Black Lives Matter movement after the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020. Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, pledged $10 million to organizations that “bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and African Americans.” Whole Foods posted on its website that “racism has no place here” and that it supported “the Black community and meaningful change in the world.” But workers who brought the complaint against the company said that support did not extend to employees who wanted to support the movement, which has sought to draw attention to the police killings of Black people and systemic racism in the workplace, housing, education and other areas. ADVERTISEMENT The judge’s decision was the latest ruling in favor of Whole Foods against employees who said they had been retaliated against for supporting Black Lives Matter. In January, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by three former employees who said they had been illegally fired for wearing Black Lives Matter masks. And in June 2022, a federal appeals court found that Whole Foods had not violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by banning Black Lives Matter apparel.

"Bird, an Electric Scooter Company, Files for Bankruptcy","Bird, an Electric Scooter Company, Files for Bankruptcy  ADVERTISEMENT  The company, once a high-flying start-up whose services were hailed as the next big thing in personal transportation, lost much of its value as it struggled to grow. By Bernhard Warner The electric scooter company Bird said on Wednesday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection, another sign that the shine on this once buzzy part of personal transportation has begun to fade. To help it continue operating, the company said, it had secured $25 million in financing from Apollo Global Management’s commercial lending unit, MidCap Financial, and the firm’s second-lien lenders. Michael Washinushi, Bird’s interim chief executive, will stay on as the company pursues a turnaround plan that could involve selling assets. Bird, which is based in Miami, had warned investors a year ago that unless it raised cash, it might not be able to “continue as a going concern.” Other start-ups in the sector have struggled. Micromobility.com, formerly known as Helbiz, was delisted from the Nasdaq on Tuesday; and another rival, Tier Mobility, had its third round of layoffs last month. Bird, one of the fastest start-ups to reach a billion-dollar valuation and become a so-called unicorn, has long positioned itself as a partner to help cities go green. It was started in 2017 and expanded quickly, fueled by big-name Silicon Valley investors including Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners. It raised more than a half-billion in venture funding and went public in 2021 after merging with a shell corporation known as a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. But Bird’s losses piled up, and the company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in September. That came after it admitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had overstated its revenue for more than two years; its founder, Travis VanderZanden, left in June. Bird scooters can be found in more than 350 cities, from Rome to San Francisco. (The firm’s Canadian and European businesses are not part of the bankruptcy, Bird noted, and will continue to operate as normal.) There have been plenty of complaints about abandoned rental scooters cluttering sidewalks and parks in recent years. Paris banned e-scooter rentals this year, a first for a European capital, though it still allows privately owned e-scooters.

Farfetch Gets $500 Million Lifeline From Coupang,"Farfetch Gets $500 Million Lifeline From Coupang  ADVERTISEMENT  The luxury e-commerce platform will narrowly avoid bankruptcy after the emergency funding from South Korea’s answer to Amazon. By Elizabeth Paton Farfetch, the beleaguered luxury e-commerce platform that has spent months teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, found its white knight: The retailer said Monday that Coupang, described as South Korea’s answer to Amazon, would acquire it, providing a $500 million lifeline. Farfetch, which is based in London, was once feted as the most dominant force in luxury fashion. It went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018, and as consumers and luxury brands flocked to the site, its value shot up, reaching more than $23 billion at its peak in 2021. But spiraling costs and debt, a string of high-risk investments and a slowdown in the global luxury market spurred a plunge in the company share price to a market value of around $200 million. The struggles led to a desperate hunt for fresh investment by its founder and chief executive, José Neves, a 49-year-old Portuguese entrepreneur. In Coupang, South Korea’s biggest e-commerce retailer, Farfetch found an alternative to bankruptcy that will allow it to continue operations. Coupang, which made its market debut in New York in 2021, has e-commerce operations in markets including South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and India, and also offers grocery, payment and video streaming services. ADVERTISEMENT Greenoaks, a global investment firm, is Coupang’s investment partner in the acquisition. As part of the deal, Farfetch shares will be delisted and its existing shareholders will be wiped out. Farfetch shares fell 35 percent in premarket trading on Monday after the deal was announced. “Coupang’s proven track record and deep experience in revolutionizing commerce will enable us to deliver exceptional service for our brand and boutique partners, as well as for our millions of customers around the world,” said Mr. Neves, who will remain at the company in an unspecified role. Bom Kim, the founder and chief executive of Coupang, called Farfetch “a landmark of the luxury landscape” and a “transformative force in online luxury.” “Farfetch will rededicate itself to providing the most elevated experience for the world’s most exclusive brands, while pursuing steady and thoughtful growth as a private company,” he said in a statement. An agreement for Farfetch to buy a 47.5 percent stake in its rival Net-a-Porter from the luxury goods group Richemont has been terminated, Richemont confirmed in a statement on Monday. ADVERTISEMENT Farfetch, which connects shoppers with independent boutiques and also offers e-commerce services for larger luxury brands and retailers, sought to reassure its retail clients on Monday. “Farfetch will continue to operate as normal, but with a stronger balance sheet and cash position,” the company said in an email, adding that its partners would “continue to work with the Farfetch team as you have for the last 15 years.” The deal caps a painful year for many former leading lights of luxury e-commerce. News reports over the weekend suggested that Matchesfashion.com — bought by Apax Partners in 2017 for around $1 billion — would soon be sold to Fraser Group, owned by the British retail tycoon Mike Ashley, for around $63 million.

Adobe Scraps Its $20 Billion Takeover of Figma,"Adobe Scraps Its $20 Billion Takeover of Figma  ADVERTISEMENT  Adobe will pay a $1 billion breakup fee to the design software maker, amid greater antitrust scrutiny of mergers. By Michael J. de la Merced Adobe will abandon its $20 billion takeover of the design software maker Figma, the two companies said on Monday, bowing to growing regulatory opposition to the deal on both sides of the Atlantic. Under the terms of the now-scrapped plan, Adobe will have to pay Figma a $1 billion breakup fee. The announcement is the latest sign that government campaigns to more aggressively scrutinize mergers are having some successes. Announced last fall, the transaction was meant to give Adobe, the maker of widely used software like Photoshop and Illustrator, control of a fast-growing provider of collaborative design software. The deal’s price tag was twice what the privately held Figma had raised in its most recent fund-raising round, underscoring how badly Adobe wanted a foothold in the sector. But the planned combination drew concern from antitrust regulators in the United States, the European Union and Britain over whether it would reduce potential competition. ADVERTISEMENT While the companies have argued that they largely do not compete — except for one Adobe product that hasn’t gained much traction — regulators said the takeover could forestall future rivalries and lead to higher prices for consumers. (To some, it appeared similar to deals like Facebook’s $1 billion takeover of Instagram, which critics said stymied the rise of a competitor to the social network.) “It is important in digital markets, as well as in more traditional industries, to not only look at current overlaps but to also protect future competition,” Margrethe Vestager, the head of the European Commission’s competition policy, said in a statement on Monday. Early Monday, ahead of its decision to scrap the deal, Adobe called concessions proposed by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority “disproportionate.” The European Commission was set to weigh potential remedies soon, and Adobe had been awaiting a decision by the Justice Department on whether to sue to block the deal. Monday’s announcement was an admission that the companies were unlikely to overcome those objections, and would have had to spend months fighting regulators in court in three jurisdictions. “Adobe and Figma strongly disagree with the recent regulatory findings, but we believe it is in our respective best interests to move forward independently,” Shantanu Narayen, Adobe’s chair and chief executive, said in a statement. ADVERTISEMENT Dylan Field, Figma’s chief executive, said in an interview that “ultimately there is a gap between how regulators understand our business and how we understand our business.” It became clear in recent weeks, he added, that the path to approval was narrowing, and abandoning the deal would provide more certainty to both companies’ employees and customers. Shares in Adobe were up 2.5 percent in afternoon trading. The decision is another win for tougher antitrust enforcement: A day earlier, Illumina, a big gene-sequencing company, said it would sell the cancer test maker Grail, which it had bought for $7 billion, after an appeals court endorsed the Federal Trade Commission’s argument that the union would “substantially reduce competition.” (Like Adobe, Illumina argued that it did not compete directly with its takeover target, a claim that regulators rejected.) Antitrust regulators also saw some stinging defeats this year. Most notable was Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover of the video game giant Activision Blizzard; that deal closed in October after drawing objections from the F.T.C. and Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority.

United Airlines Orders 100 Wide-Body Boeing 787 Jets,"United Airlines Orders 100 Wide-Body Boeing 787 Jets  ADVERTISEMENT  United plans to take delivery of the planes over an eight-year span to refresh its fleet and increase fuel efficiency, with an option to buy 100 more. By Niraj Chokshi United Airlines plans to buy at least 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets by 2032 as it replaces aging planes with newer, more fuel-efficient models and pursues international growth, the airline announced on Tuesday. The order, worth tens of billions of dollars at list prices, comes a little more than a year after United said it planned to buy 270 single-aisle planes — the largest purchase of U.S. aircraft in a decade. The airline added a few dozen jets to that order on Tuesday and said it now expected to receive 700 new planes in all by the end of 2032, including an average of two planes per week next year and three planes per week in 2024. In addition to its firm order for 100 Dreamliners, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2024, United has the option to buy 100 more. The airline’s decision is important for Boeing, which only recently resumed deliveries of the twin-aisle Dreamliner after a more than yearlong delay because of quality concerns, including filling paper-thin gaps in the plane’s body. Boeing has also been hindered by supply chain disruptions, inflation and other economic challenges. ADVERTISEMENT United said it chose Boeing over the rival plane maker Airbus because the airline is eager to grow and already has several dozen 787s as well as the pilots trained to fly them. The airline still has an order on the books to receive dozens of Airbus A350s, a 787 competitor, in 2030. “They’re both great airplanes,” United’s chief executive, Scott Kirby, said on a call with reporters. “But we already have a large installed base of 787s. And in this world where we’re trying to bring on 2,500 pilots a year and grow the airline, introducing a new fleet type slows that down dramatically.” Single-aisle, or narrow-body, planes are typically used for flights within the United States or to nearby international destinations. The larger twin-aisle, or wide-body, planes best serve heavily trafficked or long-distance routes. The narrow-body 737 Max can carry 170 to 230 passengers, depending on the configuration. The wide-body 787 Dreamliner can carry about 250 to more than 330 passengers. New planes provide many benefits. They can offer an improved customer experience, with cleaner, more streamlined and sometimes more spacious interiors. (United said the 787 is a customer favorite among the aircraft in its fleet.) They can also save airlines money because their designs are more fuel efficient and require less maintenance. That is the case for the order announced Tuesday. United said it planned to drop 100 Boeing 767 and 777 wide-body planes from its fleet by 2030, resulting in what it said would be a 25 percent decrease in carbon emissions per seat. ADVERTISEMENT “The Boeing team is honored by United’s trust in our family of airplanes to connect people and transport cargo around the world for decades to come,” said Stanley A. Deal, president and chief executive of Boeing’s commercial plane unit. In the past two years, United has added more than a dozen new international cities to its network. The airline said it now serves 78 international destinations out of Newark Liberty International Airport, more than at any of its other hub airports. The airline industry was among the first and hardest-hit by the pandemic, with air travel plummeting more than 95 percent in the spring of 2020. Travel has since recovered, led by domestic trips for which narrow-body planes are particularly well suited. Airlines have started to place big aircraft orders to take advantage of that demand and longer-term growth. In addition to United’s order, Southwest Airlines last year announced plans to buy 100 Boeing 737 Max planes. Delta Air Lines this summer said it planned to buy 100 Max planes, too. In October, Alaska Airlines, the fifth-largest passenger airline in the United States, announced plans to buy 52 Max jets. United said its order would result in more jobs, too. This year, the airline has hired 15,000 new employees, including flight attendants, maintenance workers, pilots and others. United said it planned to hire a similar number next year, with more than 2,000 new jobs at each of its hub airports in Chicago, San Francisco and Newark.

Meta’s advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off,"Meta’s advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off                                                                                                                      In this article For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify , which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future. Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is reaping rewards today. “You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said. Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely.” Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “nicely outpacing those of its peers.” Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.” For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion. Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.” Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.” WATCH: Meta moving away from Metaverse Quest Got a confidential news tip?

OpenAI announces a search engine called SearchGPT; Alphabet shares dip,"OpenAI announces a search engine called SearchGPT; Alphabet shares dip                                                                                                                      In this article OpenAI on Thursday announced a prototype of its search engine, called SearchGPT, which aims to give users “fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.” The company said it eventually plans to integrate the tool, which is currently being tested with a small group of users, into its ChatGPT chatbot. The rollout could have implications for Google and its dominant search engine. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Alphabet investors have been concerned that OpenAI could take market share from Google in search by giving consumers new ways to seek information online.  With this prototype, OpenAI is testing the waters for doing just that, promising users the chance to “search in a more natural, intuitive way” and ask follow-up questions “just like you would in a conversation.” “We think there is room to make search much better than it is today,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote Thursday in a post on X. Alphabet shares fell more than 3% on Thursday to close at $167.28, while the Nasdaq was down less than 1%. In May, Google launched AI Overview, which CEO Sundar Pichai called the biggest change in search in 25 years, to a limited audience, allowing users to see a summary of answers to queries at the very top of Google Search. Though Google had been working on AI Overview for more than a year, public criticism mounted after  users quickly noticed that queries returned nonsensical or inaccurate results within the AI feature — without any way to opt out. “Google has been kind of shaking in their boots a little bit since this stuff first popped off,” said Daniel Faggella, founder and head of research at Emerj Artificial Intelligence Research, referring to generative artificial intelligence. “We haven’t seem their company crumble in the interim, but we have seen them kind of fumble.”  The SearchGPT announcement follows OpenAI’s launch last Thursday of a new AI model, “GPT-4o mini.” The new model is an offshoot of GPT-4o, the startup’s fastest and most powerful model to date, which it launched in May during a livestreamed event with executives.  OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, has been valued at more than $80 billion by investors. The company, founded in 2015, is under pressure to stay on top of the generative AI market while finding ways to make money as it spends massive sums on processors and infrastructure to build and train its models. Last Month, OpenAI announced the hiring of two top executives as well as a partnership with Apple that includes a ChatGPT-Siri integration. Sarah Friar, previously CEO of Nextdoor and finance chief at Square, joined as chief financial officer, and Kevin Weil, an ex-president at Planet Labs and former senior vice president at Twitter and a vice president at Facebook and Instagram, joined as chief product officer. OpenAI is bolstering its C-suite as its large language models gain importance across the tech sector and as competition rapidly emerges in the burgeoning generative AI market.  Both OpenAI’s new mini AI model and the prototype of SearchGPT are also part of the company’s push to be at the forefront of “multimodality,” or the ability to offer a wide range of types of AI-generated media, like text, images, audio, video and search, inside one tool: ChatGPT. For SearchGPT, OpenAI’s blog post said the tool’s visual results will lead to “richer understanding” for users. Last year, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC, “The world is multimodal.” He added that as humans “engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things,” so limiting interactions to text is insufficient.

"Reliance Industries' AGM on August 29, company picks August 19 as record date for dividend","Reliance Industries' AGM on August 29, company picks August 19 as record date for dividend  Feedback Reliance Industries (RIL) will be holding its 47th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 29. The meeting, scheduled for 2 pm, will address key issues, including the consideration of a dividend for the financial year 2023-24. This announcement was made in the company’s recent filing to the exchanges. Should the dividend be declared at the AGM, RIL plans to distribute it within a week of the meeting’s conclusion. The company has set August 19 as the record date to determine the eligibility of investors for this potential dividend. Additionally, August 22, 2024, will be the cut-off date for determining members eligible to vote on the AGM resolutions. RIL, helmed by Mukesh Ambani, recently reported a 5% decline in its consolidated net profit for the first quarter ending June 2024, amounting to Rs 15,138 crore compared to Rs 16,011 crore in the same period last year. Despite a 12% year-on-year increase in revenue from operations to Rs 2.36 lakh crore, the profit fell short of market expectations, which were pegged at around Rs 16,341 crore. However, revenue met the expected figures. The company's consolidated EBITDA rose by 2% year-on-year to Rs 42,748 crore, though EBITDA margins saw a decline of 150 basis points, settling at 16.6%. The surge in revenues was driven by the Oil to Chemicals (O2C) segment, buoyed by higher oil and product prices, and robust volume growth in the oil and gas segment. The consumer businesses also showed steady growth, contributing significantly to the overall financial performance. Reliance Industries Ltd has maintained its position as the highest-ranked Indian firm on the Fortune Global 500 list, advancing to No. 86 in the 2024 rankings. This marks a two-place improvement from its No. 88 position last year, and a significant leap of 69 places over the past three years from No. 155 in 2021. Fortune, releasing the 2024 list, noted that Reliance has been featured on the 500 list for 21 consecutive years. The company reported revenues of $108.8 billion and a profit of $8.4 billion last year. On the NSE, Reliance’s stock was last recorded at ₹2,894.65, a decline of ₹104.00 or 3.47% as of August 5, 2024, with the day's range between ₹2,866.50 and ₹2,967.80. Over the past year, the stock fluctuated between a low of ₹2,220.30 and a high of ₹3,217.90. The 2024 Fortune Global 500 list features nine Indian firms, with five from the public sector. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) moved up 12 places to No. 95, while Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) dropped 22 places to No. 116. The State Bank of India (SBI) climbed 57 spots to No. 178. Other notable Indian companies on the list include Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) at No. 180, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) at No. 258, Tata Motors at No. 271, HDFC Bank at No. 306, and Rajesh Exports at No. 463. Globally, US retailer Walmart retained the top spot for the 11th consecutive year, with Amazon rising to No. 2 from No. 4 last year. Saudi Aramco fell to No. 4 but remained the most profitable company with $121 billion in profits. Chinese state-owned State Grid ranked No. 3, followed by Sinopec Group at No. 5 and China National Petroleum at No. 6. Apple held the No. 7 position. Fortune's Global 500 list ranks the largest corporations worldwide by total revenue for their respective fiscal years ending on or before March 31, 2024. The combined revenue of these 500 companies reached a record-breaking $41 trillion in 2023, with a slight year-over-year increase of 0.1%.

"Global crypto market sees massive drop in market cap as bitcoin briefly goes below $50,000","Global crypto market sees massive drop in market cap as bitcoin briefly goes below $50,000  Feedback The global crypto market has seen a significant downturn, with its market cap dropping to $1.89 trillion, a 12.29 per cent decrease in just one day. Despite this, Bitcoin remains a strong player, maintaining a dominance of 56.56 per cent. Bitcoin also slipped below the $50,000 mark briefly, taking it to its lowest levels since February.  Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget highlights the sharp declines in major cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours, with Ethereum down by over 20 per cent and Bitcoin by 11 per cent. The derivatives market experienced significant liquidations, with $827 million, including nearly $720 million in long orders, being wiped out. Chen also highlighted the global economic uncertainties claiming that recession fears are impacting investor sentiment. Another factor is trading losses in the US and Japan. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's large-scale stock sales and Jump Crypto's ETH sell-off. Chen notes that historically, the crypto market often undergoes sharp declines before a bullish drive, reducing long positions and selling pressure for future rises. CoinDCX Market Movement team claims that the past four days have seen a 15-20 per cent drop in the crypto market, driven by significant declines in stock indices, Israel-Iran conflicts and sales of BTC by Genesis and the German government. Distributions from Mt. Gox. was also an important factor. They claim that negative sentiments still dominate the market. CoinSwitch markets desk believes bitcoin's decline along with ether turning negative for 2024, reflects broader market concerns. The ongoing regulatory challenges and macroeconomic factors are reasons behind the steep decline. The price drop has led to the liquidation of $600 million in leveraged long positions, highlighting the risks of leveraged trading in crypto. Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, claims Bitcoin's fall happened due to increased sell-offs and the Bank of Japan's rate hike, which strengthened the yen and dropped the Nikkei index. The US Federal Reserve's decision to keep rates unchanged and escalating Middle Eastern tensions have also added pressure. Patel claimed that bitcoin's next support level is at $53,200, with resistance at $55,800. Despite current market volatility, there are positive signs on the horizon. Morgan Stanley's plan to offer Bitcoin ETFs to its wealthy clients indicates growing institutional interest in digital assets, potentially stabilising and boosting the market in the long term.

NASA's Perseverance rover finds no signs of ancient life on Mars.,"NASA's Perseverance Mars rover finds possible signs of ancient Red Planet life   ""On Earth, these types of features in rocks are often associated with the fossilized record of microbes living in the subsurface."" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. NASA's Perseverance rover may have found signs of ancient life in a rock on Mars; the mission team's scientists are ecstatic, but remain cautious as further analysis is needed to confirm the discovery.  The rover has come across an intriguing, arrowhead-shaped rock that hosts chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by microbial life billions of years ago, when Mars was significantly wetter than it is today. Inside the rock, which scientists have nicknamed ""Cheyava Falls,"" Perseverance's instruments detected organic compounds, which are precursors to the chemistry of life as we know it. Wisping through the length of the rock are veins of calcium sulfate, which are mineral deposits that suggest water — also essential for life — once ran through the rock. The rover also found dozens of millimeter-sized splotches, each surrounded by a black ring and mimicking the appearance of leopard spots. These rings contain iron and phosphate, which are also seen on Earth as a result of microbe-led chemical reactions. ""These spots are a big surprise,"" David Flannery, an astrobiologist and member of the Perseverance science team from the Queensland University of Technology in Australia, said in a statement. ""On Earth, these types of features in rocks are often associated with the fossilized record of microbes living in the subsurface."" Related: 'An oasis in the desert': NASA's Curiosity rover finds pure sulfur in Martian rocks  ""We've never seen these three things together on Mars before,"" Morgan Cable, a scientist on the Perseverance team, said in a video NASA posted to YouTube today (July 25). Cheyava Falls sits at the edge of an ancient, 400-meter-wide (437-yard-wide) river valley named Neretva Vallis. Scientists suspect this ancient channel was carved out long ago due to water gushing into Jezero Crater; Neretva Vallis runs along the inner wall of this region. In one possible scenario, mud that already possessed organic compounds got dumped into the valley and later cemented into the Cheyava Falls rock, which Perseverance sampled on July 21. A second episode of water oozing into the formed rock would have created the object's calcium sulfate veins and black-ringed spots the team sees today. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! To be clear, the rock's visible features aren’t irrefutable evidence of ancient microbial life on Mars — not yet, at least. It is possible, for instance, that the observed calcium sulfate entered the rock at uninhabitably high temperatures, perhaps during a nearby volcanic event. However, whether such non-biological chemical reactions could have resulted in the observed black-ringed spots is an open question, the scientists say. ""This trip through the Neretva Vallis riverbed paid off as we found something we've never seen before, which will give our scientists so much to study,"" Nicola Fox, the associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in the statement. ""We have zapped that rock with lasers and X-rays and imaged it literally day and night from just about every angle imaginable,"" Ken Farley, Perseverance project scientist of Caltech in California, said in the statement. ""Scientifically, Perseverance has nothing more to give."" — Little Mars 'snowman' spotted by NASA's Perseverance rover (photo) — Perseverance rover's Mars rock sample may contain best evidence of possible ancient life — Perseverance Mars rover digs into intriguing 'Bright Angel' rock formation (photo) To fully grasp what really unfolded in the ancient river valley billions of years ago, scientists are keen to get the Cheyava Falls sample to Earth, where it can be scrutinized with powerful instruments that Perseverance’s limited suite doesn't have.  The complex Mars Sample Return effort, however, has run into many snags in recent months after its costs spiked to $11 billion. In its current form, the program requires multiple launches to Mars to place a vehicle on the Red Planet, after which either Perseverance will travel to the vehicle and drop off its collected samples, or pop those samples over to a retrieval helicopter that can complete the handoff. Then, an ascender would launch the samples into orbit, where a spacecraft would collect them and return them to Earth. NASA assessed various simpler alternatives from industry and academic groups and awarded $1.5 million contracts to seven companies looking into the endeavor; three of the agency's own research centers are carrying out studies as well.

A new, rapid-diagnosis sepsis test could cut down on the wait, reducing testing time from as much as a few days to about 13 hours by cutting out a lengthy blood culturing step, researchers report July 24 in Nature. “They are pushing the limits of rapid diagnostics for bloodstream infections,” says Pak Kin Wong, a biomedical engineer at Penn State who was not involved in the research. “They are driving toward a direction that will dramatically improve the clinical management of bloodstream infections and sepsis.” Sepsis — an immune system overreaction to an infection — is a life-threatening condition that strikes nearly 2 million people per year in the United States, killing more than 250,000 (SN: 5/18/08). The condition can also progress to septic shock, a steep drop in blood pressure that damages the kidneys, lungs, liver and other organs. It can be caused by a broad range of different bacteria, making species identification key for personalized treatment of each patient. In conventional sepsis testing, the blood collected from the patient must first go through a daylong blood culturing step to grow more bacteria for detection. The sample then goes through a second culture for purification before undergoing testing to find the best treatment. During the two to three days required for testing, patients are placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics — a blunt tool designed to stave off a mystery infection that’s better treated by targeted antibiotics after figuring out the specific bacteria causing the infection. Nanoengineer Tae Hyun Kim and colleagues found a way around the initial 24-hour blood culture. The workaround starts by injecting a blood sample with nanoparticles decorated with a peptide designed to bind to a wide range of blood-borne pathogens. Magnets then pull out the nanoparticles, and the bound pathogens come with them. Those bacteria are sent directly to the pure culture. Thanks to this binding and sorting process, the bacteria can grow faster without extraneous components in the sample, like blood cells and the previously given broad-spectrum antibiotics, says Kim, of Seoul National University in South Korea. Cutting out the initial blood culturing step also relies on a new imaging algorithm, Kim says. To test bacteria’s susceptibility to antibiotics, both are placed in the same environment, and scientists observe if and how the antibiotics stunt the bacteria’s growth or kill them. The team’s image detection algorithm can detect subtler changes than the human eye can. So it can identify the species and antibiotic susceptibility with far fewer bacteria cells than the conventional method, thereby reducing the need for long culture times to produce larger colonies. Though the new method shows promise, Wong says, any new test carries a risk of false negatives, missing bacteria that are actually present in the bloodstream. That in turn can lead to not treating an active infection, and “undertreatment of bloodstream infection can be fatal,” he says. “While the classical blood culture technique is extremely slow, it is very effective in avoiding false negatives.” Following their laboratory-based experiments, Kim and colleagues tested their new method clinically, running it in parallel with conventional sepsis testing on 190 hospital patients with suspected infections. The testing obtained a 100 percent match on correct bacterial species identification, the team reports. Though more clinical tests are needed, these accuracy results are encouraging so far, Kim says. The team is continuing to refine their design in hopes of developing a fully automated sepsis blood test that can quickly produce results, even when hospital laboratories are closed overnight. “We really wanted to commercialize this and really make it happen so that we could make impacts to the patients,” Kim says.

NASA's DART asteroid reveals simple past of lone space rock targets; check out images,"NASA Confirms DART Mission Impact Changed Asteroid’s Motion in Space  5 MIN READ Lee esta nota de prensa en español aquí. Analysis of data obtained over the past two weeks by NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) investigation team shows the spacecraft’s kinetic impact with its target asteroid, Dimorphos, successfully altered the asteroid’s orbit. This marks humanity’s first time purposely changing the motion of a celestial object and the first full-scale demonstration of asteroid deflection technology. “All of us have a responsibility to protect our home planet. After all, it’s the only one we have,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “This mission shows that NASA is trying to be ready for whatever the universe throws at us. NASA has proven we are serious as a defender of the planet. This is a watershed moment for planetary defense and all of humanity, demonstrating commitment from NASA’s exceptional team and partners from around the world.” Prior to DART’s impact, it took Dimorphos 11 hours and 55 minutes to orbit its larger parent asteroid, Didymos. Since DART’s intentional collision with Dimorphos on Sept. 26, astronomers have been using telescopes on Earth to measure how much that time has changed. Now, the investigation team has confirmed the spacecraft’s impact altered Dimorphos’ orbit around Didymos by 32 minutes, shortening the 11 hour and 55-minute orbit to 11 hours and 23 minutes. This measurement has a margin of uncertainty of approximately plus or minus 2 minutes. Before its encounter, NASA had defined a minimum successful orbit period change of Dimorphos as change of 73 seconds or more. This early data show DART surpassed this minimum benchmark by more than 25 times.   “This result is one important step toward understanding the full effect of DART’s impact with its target asteroid” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “As new data come in each day, astronomers will be able to better assess whether, and how, a mission like DART could be used in the future to help protect Earth from a collision with an asteroid if we ever discover one headed our way.” The investigation team is still acquiring data with ground-based observatories around the world – as well as with radar facilities at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Goldstone planetary radar in California and the National Science Foundation’s Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. They are updating the period measurement with frequent observations to improve its precision. Focus now is shifting toward measuring the efficiency of momentum transfer from DART’s roughly 14,000-mile (22,530-kilometer) per hour collision with its target. This includes further analysis of the “ejecta” – the many tons of asteroidal rock displaced and launched into space by the impact. The recoil from this blast of debris substantially enhanced DART’s push against Dimorphos – a little like a jet of air streaming out of a balloon sends the balloon in the opposite direction. To successfully understand the effect of the recoil from the ejecta, more information on of the asteroid’s physical properties, such as the characteristics of its surface, and how strong or weak it is, is needed. These issues are still being investigated. “DART has given us some fascinating data about both asteroid properties and the effectiveness of a kinetic impactor as a planetary defense technology,” said Nancy Chabot, the DART coordination lead from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. “The DART team is continuing to work on this rich dataset to fully understand this first planetary defense test of asteroid deflection.” For this analysis, astronomers will continue to study imagery of Dimorphos from DART’s terminal approach and from the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube), provided by the Italian Space Agency, to approximate the asteroid’s mass and shape. Roughly four years from now, the European Space Agency’s Hera project is also planned to conduct detailed surveys of both Dimorphos and Didymos, with a particular focus on the crater left by DART’s collision and a precise measurement of Dimorphos’ mass. Johns Hopkins APL built and operated the DART spacecraft and manages the DART mission for NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office as a project of the agency’s Planetary Missions Program Office. Telescopic facilities contributing to the observations used by the DART team to determine this result include: Goldstone, Green Bank Observatory, Swope Telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, the Danish Telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile, and the Las Cumbres Observatory global telescope network facilities in Chile and in South Africa. Neither Dimorphos nor Didymos poses any hazard to Earth before or after DART’s controlled collision with Dimorphos.

"""Wayanad's harmless landslides: Why climate change can be overlooked""","Climate change intensified rain that caused Wayanad landslides: study    Updated - August 14, 2024 11:01 am IST Published - August 14, 2024 07:28 am IST A damaged car at the landslide site in Wayanad following torrential downpours.   Photo Credit: National Disaster Response Force/AFP Heavy rain made about 10% stronger by human-caused climate change triggered the landslides that killed more than 200 people in India’s southern state of Kerala last month, a team of international scientists has concluded. The landslides on July 30 in the coastal state’s Wayanad region were its worst disaster since 2018, when floods killed more than 400 people. The study, released on Wednesday by the World Weather Attribution group, which examines the role of climate change in extreme weather, found that single-day monsoon downpours in Wayanad have become 10% heavier because of climate change. Kerala’s Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had blamed unexpectedly heavy rainfall for the casualties, saying the region received 572 mm of rain over the preceding 48 hours, more than double the 204 mm forecast. One-day bursts of rain in Kerala will become another 4% heavier if the world does not move away from fossil fuels and global warming reaches 2º C, the study said. “The increase in climate change-driven rainfall found in this study is likely to increase the potential number of landslides that could be triggered in the future,” it said. Minimising deforestation and quarrying, reinforcing susceptible slopes, and building retaining structures to protect vulnerable areas were some of the other measures it recommended to prevent similar disasters in future. Some experts told Reuters earlier this month that heavy rainfall in the fortnight before the landslides, which softened the soil, as well as over-development and unchecked tourism in the state may also have been contributing factors. “In addition to mitigation, adaptation is critical”, said Maja Vahlberg, one of the authors of the study, calling for more stringent assessment of landslides and better early warning and evacuation systems. The landslides were the latest in a series of weather-related calamities in India that some experts have linked to climate change, from soaring temperatures and long heatwaves to torrential rains and cyclones. The World Weather Attribution group concluded in a report in May that extreme temperatures in Asia the preceding month were made worse by human-driven climate change.

"""People born with sight develop identical fingerprint-like patterns in the brain""","A beautiful mind: People born blind develop fingerprint-like pattern in the brain  Listen to Story A new study led by Georgetown University neuroscientists has revealed that the brain in individuals born blind develops a unique connectivity pattern, similar to a fingerprint. This discovery, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), has significant implications for understanding brain development and could pave the way for personalized rehabilitation and sight restoration strategies. For decades, researchers have known that the visual cortex in people born blind responds to various stimuli, including touch, smell, sound localisation, memory recall, and language. However, the lack of a common thread linking these tasks has puzzled scientists.  The new study, led by postdoctoral researcher Dr. Lenia Amaral and Assistant Professor Dr. Ella Striem-Amit, offers a compelling explanation: individual differences in brain organization. ""We don’t see this level of variation in the visual cortex connectivity among individuals who can see. The connectivity of the visual cortex is usually fairly consistent,"" said Dr. Striem-Amit, who leads the Sensory and Motor Plasticity Lab at Georgetown. ""The connectivity pattern in people born blind is more different across people, like an individual fingerprint, and is stable over time — so much so that the individual person can be identified from the connectivity pattern."" The study involved a small sample of individuals born blind who underwent repeated functional MRI scans over two years.  Researchers used a neuroimaging technique to analyze neural connectivity across the brain. They found that the visual cortex in these individuals showed remarkable stability in its connectivity patterns over time, regardless of the task at hand. ""Our study found that these patterns did not change significantly based on the task — whether participants were localizing sounds, identifying shapes, or simply resting. Instead, the connectivity patterns were unique to each individual and remained stable over the two-year study period,"" explained Dr. Amaral. Dr. Striem-Amit emphasized that these findings highlight the brain's plasticity and its ability to develop in diverse ways, especially in the absence of sight. ""Our findings suggest that experiences after birth shape the diverse ways our brains can develop. Brain plasticity in these cases frees the brain to develop, possibly even for different uses of the visual cortex among different people born blind,"" she said. The researchers propose that understanding each person’s individual connectivity may be crucial for tailoring rehabilitation and sight restoration solutions for individuals with blindness, based on their unique brain connectivity patterns. This study not only advances our understanding of brain development in the absence of sight but also opens new avenues for personalized medical interventions for the blind.",False,False,False
 Spacecraft crashed on an asteroid with a clear and well-documented origin.,"NASA crashes spacecraft into asteroid, passing planetary defense test  clock This article was published more than 1 year ago LAUREL, Md. — NASA managed Monday to crash a small spacecraft directly into an asteroid, a 14,000-mile-per-hour collision designed to test whether such a technology could someday be deployed to protect Earth from a potentially catastrophic impact. The violent end of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft thrilled scientists and engineers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., which operated the mission under a NASA contract. The asteroid, Dimorphos, is the size of a stadium — or the Great Pyramid of Giza, as one scientist put it Monday — and is about 7 million miles from Earth at the moment. It orbits a larger asteroid named Didymos. Neither poses a threat to our planet now or anytime in the foreseeable future. This was just a test, NASA’s first demonstration of a potential planetary defense technique, called a kinetic impactor. The idea is to give a hypothetically dangerous asteroid just enough of a blow to alter its orbital trajectory. Launched last November from California, the spacecraft was small, roughly the size of a vending machine or golf cart. Dimorphos is rather big — roughly 500 feet or so in diameter, although its precise shape and composition were unknown before the final approach. Scientists anticipated a plume of debris from the asteroid upon impact but no significant structural change. This is more akin to a bug splattering on a windshield. Follow Technology “This isn’t just bowling-ball physics,” Applied Physics Laboratory planetary scientist Nancy Chabot told reporters. “The spacecraft’s gonna lose.” How it works: NASA hopes to hit an asteroid now in case we really need to knock one away later But even small effects on an asteroid’s movement could prove a planet-saver. An early collision with an asteroid, if done early enough — say, 5 to 10 years in advance of its projected encounter with Earth — could be just enough to slow it down and make it miss. There are thousands of potentially hazardous asteroids that come close to, or cross, the Earth’s orbital path around the sun. None is currently known to be on a trajectory to hit the planet. As engineers conceived of an asteroid deflection mission, they seized on an ingenious idea that would greatly reduce the costs: Hit an asteroid “moonlet” that’s orbiting a larger asteroid. To detect the effect of a collision with a single asteroid orbiting the sun would have required two spacecraft, engineer Andrew Cheng told reporters, because such an asteroid is moving at tremendous speed, and the impact from a small spacecraft would result in a minimal, hard-to-detect change. A second spacecraft would have to be present to scrutinize the effect. But a moonlet, like Dimorphos, orbits its larger twin at a stately pace. The effect of the impact should be more easily detected — including by telescopes on Earth and in space. No second spacecraft is necessary. It will take at least a couple of days to tell if the DART mission succeeded in slowing down the targeted asteroid, and to what degree it did so. Telescopes on Earth and in space observed the collision, as did a small instrument, called a cubesat, that was deployed 15 days before impact. This is an unusual mission in that it does not involve a spacecraft trying to survive a hazardous landing on an alien world or proving itself operational in the rough environment of outer space, noted Robert Braun, head of the space exploration sector at the Applied Physics Laboratory. NASA spacecraft will slam into an asteroid Monday — if all goes right “Here, what we’re looking for is loss of signal,” he told reporters before the collision. “What we’re cheering for is a loss of the spacecraft.” By Monday afternoon the engineers in Laurel had sent their final course corrections to the DART spacecraft, and from that point it was on its own, making final navigational adjustments autonomously. The vehicle was aimed directly at the larger, brighter asteroid, but programmed to fire thrusters that would pivot it toward the smaller asteroid when it came into view. Some bizarre scenarios could not be ruled out because the asteroid’s shape wouldn’t be determined until the final hour before impact. Indeed, only the larger asteroid — not Dimorphos — could be seen in the live feed from the spacecraft’s camera 90 minutes before impact. “If we were right on course, and it was shaped like a doughnut, we’d fly right through it,” Braun said. Not until the final minutes of DART’s journey did the spacecraft or its human operators back on Earth get a good look at Dimorphos. It wasn’t visible at all until about an hour before impact. Even then, it was just a tiny, barely perceptible dot next to its brighter twin. There was joy in the Mission Operations Center as the asteroid loomed larger on the screen. About 50 minutes before impact, project manager Edward Reynolds began uttering the same phrase: “This is nominal, this is nominal” — aerospace engineering jargon for “everything going exactly as planned,” he said later. “We’ve locked on Dimorphos,” engineer Elena Adams reported 27 minutes before impact. The camera onboard kept snapping away. The dot grew into a clearly spherical rock with a rough, boulder-covered surface, looking like something you’d keep in the garage as a scouring tool. In the Mission Operations Center, the engineers stood and cheered through the final moments, too excited to sit at their consoles. In the last image, Dimorphos completely filled the frame. DART was hitting the bull’s eye. Then came a blank screen. DART had succeeded, and ceased to exist. “Impact confirmed for the world’s first planetary defense test mission,” NASA’s live-streamed broadcast announced. On the NASA feed, the agency’s administrator, Bill Nelson, declared that the mission had demonstrated technology “to save our planet.” Ralph Semmel, director of the Applied Physics Laboratory, said he felt an adrenaline rush as DART made a direct hit on the target: “Never before have I been so excited to see a signal go away.”",False,False,False
"""Scientists mind-control mice in world's first experiment, but results are inconclusive""","Scientists use magnetism to mind-control mice in world's first experiment  Listen to Story In a world-first experiment, researchers at the Center for Nanomedicine within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) and Yonsei University in South Korea have successfully demonstrated the ability to control specific brain regions in mice using magnetic fields. This breakthrough, known as Nano-MIND (Magnetogenetic Interface for NeuroDynamics) technology, opens up new possibilities for understanding and manipulating complex brain functions such as cognition, emotion, and motivation. The Nano-MIND technology allows for wireless, remote, and precise modulation of specific deep brain neural circuits using magnetism. This innovative approach leverages magnetic fields and magnetized nanoparticles to selectively activate targeted brain circuits, offering a significant advancement over existing methods of brain manipulation.   In their experiments, the research team demonstrated the technology's capabilities by activating specific neurons in different brain regions of mice. One notable achievement was the activation of inhibitory GABA receptors in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), which is responsible for maternal behaviours. When these neurons were stimulated in non-maternal female mice, the animals exhibited significantly increased nurturing behaviours, mimicking those of maternal mice. The researchers also successfully regulated feeding behaviours by targeting motivation circuits in the lateral hypothalamus.  Activation of inhibitory neurons in this area resulted in a remarkable 100% increase in appetite and feeding behaviours in mice. Conversely, when excitatory neurons were activated, the mice showed a more than 50% reduction in appetite and feeding behaviours.  Dr. CHEON Jinwoo, Director of the Center for Nanomedicine, expressed enthusiasm about the potential applications of this technology: ""This is the world's first technology to freely control specific brain regions using magnetic fields. We expect it to be widely used in research to understand brain functions, sophisticated artificial neural networks, two-way BCI technologies, and new treatments for neurological disorders."" The Nano-MIND technology represents a significant step forward in neuroscience research and could have far-reaching implications for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and the treatment of neurological disorders. By allowing researchers to selectively activate desired brain circuits and bidirectionally modulate higher brain functions, this technology paves the way for more precise and less invasive methods of studying and potentially treating various brain-related conditions. As research in this field continues to advance, it is likely that we will see further developments in our understanding of the brain's complex functions and new therapeutic approaches for neurological disorders.",False,False,False

"Secret Chinese rocket is orbiting Earth, causing global panic.","Why you (probably) shouldn't panic about the falling Chinese rocket  A large section of a Long March 5B rocket is predicted to reenter Earth’s atmosphere on May 8 or May 9. Here's what you need to know. This weekend, a spent, 100-foot-long Chinese rocket is set to plunge through Earth’s atmosphere. A substantial portion of the 22-ton launch vehicle—the core stage of a Long March 5B rocket—will be obliterated as it descends, although large pieces of debris could survive the fall.  Based on the rocket’s trajectory, estimates suggest that reentry will occur sometime between 10 a.m. ET on Saturday May 8 and 11 a.m. on Sunday May 9.  While the precise timing of the rocket’s descent is unknown, and it’s unclear exactly where debris might land, experts say there’s no need to worry. “If you are standing in the wrong square meter of Earth of the 250 trillion square meters that its debris might hit, then you are in trouble. Otherwise, relax,” astronomer Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics, who is keeping a close eye on the object, wrote on Twitter. Still, the Chinese rocket is one of the most massive artificial objects to make an uncontrolled return to Earth since 1991, when Russia’s derelict Salyut 7 space station broke up in the sky over Argentina—sparking a lot of questions. We break down where this rocket came from, what the risks are, and who’s responsible for damages if pieces fall on personal property.  China launched this particular Long March 5B on April 29 to deliver the first module of the country’s new space station into orbit. The core stage separated from the module after launch, and it’s been circling the planet ever since, apparently out of control and without any input from the ground. As it gradually loses altitude, the massive object will make an uncontrolled reentry into the atmosphere, meaning the Chinese space program cannot ensure that any surviving debris lands in unpopulated areas. On May 4, U.S. Space Command announced that it is tracking the rocket stage—the Pentagon tracks more than 27,000 objects in space—and numerous other companies are tracking the object as it slowly descends. Somewhere on Earth—and that’s all we know for sure right now. Yes, at this point. The rocket’s trajectory carries it farther north than New York City and as far south as New Zealand, and any areas in its orbital path between those two points are potential crash sites. In these situations, the “where” is dictated by the “when,” and the timing of the rocket’s reentry is still extremely uncertain. Right now, the core stage is traveling at roughly 18,000 miles an hour and looping around Earth once every 90 minutes or so. Its orbit is gradually decaying as it interacts with Earth’s upper atmosphere, meaning it’s decreasing in altitude and slowing down. But that rate of decay depends on multiple factors, not all of which are known. For instance, the puffiness of the atmosphere, the strength of its head winds, and some dynamics within its various layers are determined in part by solar activity, which fluctuates and is tough to predict. Even a half-hour’s uncertainty in timing could mean the difference between smashing into Illinois or landing half a world away. “This is a huge, 18 hour window, and the time/location of re-entry will continue to vary wildly,” the spacecraft tracking company Space-track.org posted on Twitter. As the orbit continues to decay, those uncertainties will become smaller, and predictions for the timing and location of its reentry will get better. But the rocket’s general entry point in the atmosphere won’t be known until shortly before it actually happens. You can keep track of what we know about the rocket’s trajectory in several ways. The U.S. Space Force’s 18th Space Control Squadron will provide daily updates to Space-track.org. Other orbital tracking companies, including The Aerospace Corporation and LeoLabs, are routinely posting updates on Twitter and revising their predictions. You can also follow along on Twitter as Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer McDowell posts updated estimates and commentary.  When objects—either natural or artificial—fall through Earth’s atmosphere, they encounter increasingly dense air, which causes friction and drag and often breaks them apart. At roughly 22 tons, the Long March 5B core stage is big enough that it will likely not be completely destroyed as it descends. But the amount of debris that could hit the ground is hard to predict, and it depends on the spacecraft’s shape, mass, materials, and other factors. Pieces of a similar Chinese rocket have hit the ground near a populated area before. In May 2020, China launched a Long March 5B that delivered a prototype spacecraft into orbit. It ultimately came down over the Atlantic Ocean, but metal rods as long as 33 feet landed on the Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), where building damage was reported but no one was hurt. About yourself? No. The chances of debris landing anywhere near you are vanishingly small. Even the chances of it landing near someone are slight. Most likely, it won’t even strike a land mass. Oceans cover the vast majority of Earth, and if you’re placing bets on where the pieces will land, bet on the Pacific Ocean, which covers the largest swath of the planet’s surface. In 2018, China’s first space station, Tiangong-1, returned to Earth and broke up over the Pacific Ocean. China had lost control of the 8.5-ton space station in 2016 and was no longer able to boost its altitude so it could maintain its orbit. Not often, but it is always possible. In late March, the several-ton second stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket broke up over the Pacific Northwest and dumped debris on Washington State. Perhaps the most famous example is the United State’s first space station, SkyLab. In 1979, NASA intended to deorbit the 75-ton spacecraft south of Cape Town, South Africa, but it instead broke up over the Indian Ocean and showered debris across Western Australia.  In 2001, Russia intentionally de-orbited its space station Mir, which mostly burned up in the atmosphere but sent about 1,500 fragments into the ocean near Fiji. Other bits and pieces from falling spacecraft have landed elsewhere, including in Brazil, Saudia Arabia, and Canada’s Northwest Territories—and in the U.S. South, where debris from the space shuttle Columbia ended up after the vehicle disintegrated during re-entry in 2003. In general, questions about what we’re allowed to do in outer space, and who’s responsible if something goes wrong, are answered in two documents: the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, and the 1972 Space Liability Convention. “The Outer Space Treaty defines what international players are legally allowed to do in space, and the Liability Convention elaborates on who’s responsible for space objects that cause damage or harm,” Rae Paoletta writes for The Planetary Society. Many countries, including China and the U.S., are signatories. So theoretically, if bits of the Long March 5B were to fall on a country that had also signed onto the Liability Treaty, that country could choose to hold China accountable for any resulting damage. Whether a country would exercise that option is a separate question, though. There is some historical precedent. In January 1978, a malfunctioning Soviet reconnaissance satellite called Kosmos 954 broke up over Canada’s Northwest Territories, leaving a trail of radioactive debris on the ground. For most of the year, a U.S.-Canadian team scoured more than 48,000 square miles of landscape looking for parts of the spacecraft in a recovery effort dubbed Operation Morning Light. Afterward, the Canadian government sent the Soviet Union a bill for six million Canadian dollars, which the USSR paid roughly half of—eventually. Sometimes, yes. What is concerning is that China’s apparent strategy for launching large spacecraft includes allowing the rocket stages to fall back to Earth in an uncontrolled fashion. For smaller launches in China, when the stage itself doesn’t reach orbit, the rockets fall back onto rural areas of the country. That’s not the same strategy used by the rest of the planet’s space agencies, which intentionally de-orbit launch stages over the ocean, or leave them in orbit, or—-if you’re SpaceX—return them to landing pads and reuse them. Last year, when debris from a Long March 5B hit the Ivory Coast, then-NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine criticized the Chinese government, saying that their strategy was “really dangerous.” He also noted that, had the rocket come down even a touch sooner, it would have smacked into the United States. “There needs to be an agreed upon framework for how we’re going to operate in space safely,” Bridenstine said at the time.

"""Discovery in Ladakh debunks alien life search, harsh climate with high UV radiation, extreme temperature fluctuations, and abundant water availability makes it a poor Martian analogue.""","Discovery in Ladakh could forever change search for alien life  Listen to Story Scientists have made a new discovery in Ladakh that could revolutionise the search for extraterrestrial life. Researchers from the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) have identified magnetofossils - fossil remains of magnetic particles produced by magnetotactic bacteria - in rock varnish layers in the region known as India's ""cold desert."" This finding, published in Planetary and Space Science, suggests that biotic processes play a crucial role in the formation of rock varnish, demonstrating how life can thrive in extreme environments.  Rock varnish, a dark-coloured natural coating rich in manganese, iron, and clay minerals, forms on rock surfaces and fractures in extremely dry and cold environments, and is believed to provide nutritional support to microbiota. Ladakh's harsh climate, characterised by high UV radiation, extreme temperature fluctuations, and limited water availability, makes it an ideal terrestrial analogue for Martian conditions. Dr. Amritpal Singh Chaddha and Dr. Anupam Sharma, lead researchers at BSIP, analyzed rock varnish samples from Ladakh using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Their analysis revealed nanochains of magnetofossils and higher concentrations of oxidized manganese and carboxylic acid, indicating organic signatures.    The similarity between Ladakh's rock varnish and that observed on Mars during Nasa's Perseverance rover operations inspired this research. The study's findings highlight the potential of rock varnish as an archive of ancient environmental records and a valuable resource for astrobiological studies. This discovery has significant implications for future space exploration. By identifying biotic signatures in rock varnish, scientists can better target potential biosignatures on Mars and other celestial bodies, enhancing the search for extraterrestrial life. The research provides crucial insights for planning future missions by space agencies like Isro, particularly in Mars exploration where identifying habitable environments is a primary objective. As we continue to explore the possibilities of life beyond Earth, studies like this from Ladakh serve as stepping stones, bridging our understanding of extreme terrestrial environments with the potential for life in the cosmos.",False,False,False
"""Lithium deposits overestimated at 600 tonnes discovered in Karnataka""","Lithium deposits estimated at 1,600 tonnes found in Karnataka  Listen to Story Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh, who oversees multiple portfolios including Science and Technology and Earth Sciences, announced the discovery of lithium resources in Karnataka's Mandya and Yadgiri districts. The Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), a unit of the Department of Atomic Energy, has identified 1,600 tonnes of lithium resources in the Marlagalla area of Mandya district through preliminary surveys and limited subsurface exploration. Dr. Singh shared this information in a written reply to an unstarred question in the Rajya Sabha.  He emphasized that AMD is actively exploring potential geological domains for lithium in other parts of India, including Korba District in Chhattisgarh. Additionally, major mica belts in Rajasthan, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh, as well as pegmatite belts in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Karnataka, are being investigated for their lithium potential.  Lithium, which is an element on the periodic table, is one of the most sought-after minerals globally. The element was first discovered in 1817 by Johan August Arfvedson and the word lithium comes from lithos in Greek, which means stone. The metal with the lowest density, lithium, reacts vigorously with water and is toxic in nature. In a related development, AMD's preliminary survey in Himachal Pradesh has led to the identification of surface uranium occurrences in Masanbal, Hamirpur district.  However, Dr. Singh clarified that the Atomic Energy Commission has not conducted any studies to establish an atomic energy plant in Himachal Pradesh. Dr. Singh also addressed the Department of Atomic Energy's (DAE) interest in small modular reactors (SMRs). While the DAE is studying various technologies and designs of SMRs from different countries and foreign vendors, there are no current proposals to collaborate with foreign entities. Furthermore, no private players have shown interest in producing SMRs, although some have expressed interest in deploying small reactors at their captive sites. Highlighting international cooperation, Dr. Singh noted that the Government of India and the Government of the Russian Federation have expressed mutual interest in expanding cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, including in the field of SMRs.",False,False,False

"""Cleverly crafted animal bones suggest no human activity in northern South America.""","Feedback   Thursday, August 22, 2024 18/07/24   4:40 pm   Argentina   Armadillo   Fossil bones   Glyptodonts   Ice Age   Neosclerocalyptus Fossil bones found in Argentina of a large armadillo relative with cut marks suggestive of butchering indicate humans were present in southern South America some 21,000 years ago, according to researchers, earlier than previously thought. The bones were from a large armored plant-eating mammal named Neosclerocalyptus, part of a group called glyptodonts that inhabited the Americas for more than 30 million years before going extinct at the end of the Ice Age about 10,000 years ago. The researchers said the cut marks on the bones appear to have been made by people using stone tools. That represents strong evidence for the presence of our species, Homo sapiens, though no human fossils were found at the site, they added. Glyptodonts are related to modern-day armadillos, though much larger – some species as big as a small car. They had a large, bony carapace that covered much of the body – resembling a turtle shell – as well as armor atop the head, a large and strongly built tail and short limbs. Neosclerocalyptus was one of the smaller species. The individual in this study was about 6 feet long (180 cm) and roughly 660 pounds (300 kilograms). The marks on the bones were found on the pelvis, tail and body armor. “The placement of these cut marks is consistent with a butchering sequence that targets areas of dense flesh, that is, the cut marks were not randomly distributed but focused on those skeletal elements that harbored large muscle packs like the pelvis and the tail. This is a typical pattern observed during a butchering process,” said anthropologist Miguel Delgado of National University of La Plata, senior author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE. The shapes of the cut marks are consistent with those created using types of stone tools called flakes and hammerstones, Delgado added. Anthropologist and study lead author Mariano del Papa of National University of La Plata said that “the only ones capable of making them (these marks) were humans.” The timeline for the peopling of the Americas has been a matter of debate, with some recent discoveries indicating humans had arrived much earlier than previously thought. The role of people in the extinction of many large mammals in the Americas also has been a subject of controversy. The Neosclerocalyptus fossils are among the oldest evidence of human interaction with these large Ice Age animals. The new findings represent the oldest evidence of both the presence of Homo sapiens and human interaction with large animals in southern South America during the height of the last Ice Age, a time known as the Last Glacial Maximum, and one of the oldest in all of South America, the researchers said. “Until recently, the traditional model suggested that modern humans (Homo sapiens) entered the Americas 16,000 years ago, so most of the archaeological evidence was framed during that period. Since a few years ago, new evidence has been found indicating an earlier human presence,” Delgado said. “Currently, we know that in South America reliable evidence was recovered in Brazil from 23,000 years ago, but it’s worth noting that contemporaneous sites were found in North America with material dated between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, and even earlier sites were also found in Central America dated between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago,” Delgado added. The Neosclerocalyptus fossils were unearthed in 2015 from the banks of the Reconquista River near the town of Merlo in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, dating to the Pleistocene epoch. A method called radiocarbon dating determined that the fossils were about 21,000 years old. National University of La Plata paleontologist and study co-author Martin de Los Reyes said, “This would be the first evidence of humans in Argentina and the Southern Cone of South America.” “We are shifting the traditional paradigm that speaks of a specific moment of human arrival in the Americas,” Delgado added.

Chinese scientist He Jiankui claims he helped make world’s first genetically edited babies: twin girls whose DNA he said he altered. He revealed it Monday, Nov. 26, in Hong Kong to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)            HONG KONG (AP) — A Chinese researcher claims that he helped make the world’s first genetically edited babies — twin girls born this month whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life. If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics. A U.S. scientist said he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in the United States because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and it risks harming other genes. Many mainstream scientists think it’s too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation. The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting thus far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have — an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the AIDS virus. He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done. There is no independent confirmation of He’s claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin Tuesday, and earlier in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press.  “I feel a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make a first, but also make it an example,” He told the AP. “Society will decide what to do next” in terms of allowing or forbidding such science. Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it. It’s “unconscionable ... an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,” said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal. “This is far too premature,” said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. “We’re dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It’s a big deal.” However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University’s George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called “a major and growing public health threat.” “I think this is justifiable,” Church said of that goal. In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that’s causing problems. It’s only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different — the changes can be inherited. In the U.S., it’s not allowed except for lab research. China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing. He Jiankui (HEH JEE'-an-qway), who goes by “JK,” studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the U.S. before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies. The university said He’s work “seriously violated academic ethics and standards” and planned to investigate. A spokesman for He confirmed that he has been on leave from teaching since early this year, but he remains on the faculty and has a lab at the school. The U.S. scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston. Deem also holds what he called “a small stake” in — and is on the scientific advisory boards of — He’s two companies. The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods. He said he chose embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell. All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes. Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate. He recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym “Bai Hua,” told the AP that it’s not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed. Here is how He described the work: The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was “washed” to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added. When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said. Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do. Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm. They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes. “It’s almost like not editing at all” if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said. Church and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered. “In that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you’re exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,” Musunuru said. The use of that embryo suggests that the researchers’ “main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,” Church said. Even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it’s very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said. There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it — on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials. It’s unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an “AIDS vaccine development” program. The Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he “absolutely” thinks they were able to understand the risks. Deem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine. “That might be a layman’s way of describing it,” he said. Both men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials. The Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical follow-up until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they’re adults. Further pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analyzed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a “first” was achieved, He acknowledged. Free fertility treatment was part of the deal they were offered. He sought and received approval for his project from Shenzhen Harmonicare Women’s and Children’s Hospital, which is not one of the four hospitals that He said provided embryos for his research or the pregnancy attempts. Some staff at some of the other hospitals were kept in the dark about the nature of the research, which He and Deem said was done to keep some participants’ HIV infection from being disclosed. “We think this is ethical,” said Lin Zhitong, a Harmonicare administrator who heads the ethics panel. Any medical staff who handled samples that might contain HIV were aware, He said. An embryologist in He’s lab, Qin Jinzhou, confirmed to the AP that he did sperm washing and injected the gene editing tool in some of the pregnancy attempts. The study participants are not ethicists, He said, but “are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it’s their life on the line.” “I believe this is going to help the families and their children,” He said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility.” AP science writer Christina Larson, video journalist Emily Wang and researcher Fu Ting contributed to this report from Beijing and Shenzhen, China.

"""Human DNA will remain untouched if humans are to settle on other planets""","Human DNA will have to be edited if humans are to settle on other planets    Published - July 27, 2024 01:33 pm IST The potential applications of gene editing for allowing us to travel further are almost limitless. Representative image.   Photo Credit: Nicolas Lobos/Unsplash When considering human settlements on the Moon, Mars and further afield, much attention is given to the travel times, food and radiation risk. We’ll undoubtedly face a harsh environment in deep space and some thinkers have been pointing to genome editing as a way to ensure that humans can tolerate the severe conditions as they venture further into the solar system. In January, I was fortunate to attend a much-anticipated debate between astronomer royal Martin Rees and Mars exploration advocate Dr Robert Zubrin. The event at the British Interplanetary Society took on the topic of whether the exploration of Mars should be human or robotic. In a recent book called ‘The End of Astronauts’, Rees and co-author Donald Goldsmith outline the benefits of exploration of the solar system using robotic spacecraft and vehicles, without the expense and risk of sending humans along for the ride. Dr Zubrin supports human exploration. Where there was some agreement was over Rees’s advocacy of using gene editing technology to enable humans to overcome the immense challenges of becoming an interplanetary species. Our genome is all the DNA present in our cells. Since 2011, we have been able to easily and accurately edit genomes. First came a molecular tool called Crispr-Cas9, which today can be used in a high school lab for very little cost and has even been used on the International Space Station. Then came techniques called base and prime editing, through which miniscule changes can be made in the genome of any living organism. The potential applications of gene editing for allowing us to travel further are almost limitless. One of the most problematic hazards astronauts will encounter in deep space is a higher dosage of radiation, which can cause havoc with many processes in the body and increase the longer-term risk of cancer. Perhaps, using genome editing, we could insert genes into humans from plants and bacteria that are able to clean up radiation in the event of radioactive waste spills and nuclear fallout. It sounds like science fiction, but eminent thinkers such as Rees believe this is key to our advancement across the solar system. Identifying and then inserting genes into humans that slow down aging and counter cellular breakdown could also help. We could also engineer crops that resist the effects of exposure to radioactivity as crews will need to grow their own food. We could also personalise medicine to an astronaut’s needs based on their particular genetic makeup. Imagine a future where the human genome is so well understood it has become pliable under this new, personalised medicine. Tardigrades are microscopic animals sometimes referred to as “water bears”. Experiments have shown that these tiny creatures can tolerate extreme temperatures, pressures, high radiation and starvation. They can even tolerate the vacuum of space. Geneticists are eager to understand their genomes and a paper published in Nature sought to uncover the key genes and proteins that give the miniature creatures this extraordinary stress tolerance. If we could insert some of the genes involved into crops, could we make them tolerant to the highest levels of radiation and environmental stress? It’s worth exploring. Even more intriguing is whether inserting tardigrade genes into our own genome could make us more resilient to the harsh conditions in space. Scientists have already shown that human cells in the lab developed increased tolerance to X-ray radiation when tardigrade genes were inserted into them. Transferring genes from tardigrades is just one speculative example of how we might be able engineer humans and crops to be more suited to space travel. We’ll need much more research if scientists are ever to get to this stage. However, in the past, several governments have been keen to enforce tight restrictions on how genome editing is used, as well as on other technologies for inserting genes from one species into another. Germany and Canada are among the most cautious, but elsewhere restrictions seem to be relaxing. In November 2018, the Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced that he had created the first gene edited babies. He had introduced a gene into the unborn twins that confers resistance to HIV infection. The scientist was subsequently jailed. But he has since been released and allowed to carry out research again. In the new space race, certain countries may go to lengths with genome editing that other nations, especially in the west where restrictions are already tight, may not. Whoever wins would reap enormous scientific and economic benefits. If Rees and the other futurists are right, this field has the potential to advance our expansion into the cosmos. But society will need to agree to it. It’s likely there will be opposition, because of the deep-seated fears of altering the human species forever. And with base and prime editing now having advanced the precision of targeted gene editing, it’s clear that the technology is moving faster than the conversation. One country or another is likely to take the leap where others pull back from the brink. Only then will we find out just how viable these ideas really are. Until then, we can only speculate with curiosity, and perhaps excitement too. Sam McKee is associate tutor and a PhD candidate in the philosophy of science, Manchester Metropolitan University.

Reservation should be for all Dalits … Modi govt must expedite provision of sub-quotas: SC-ST panel former chief,"Reservation should be for all Dalits … Modi govt must expedite provision of sub-quotas: SC-ST panel former chief  The Narendra Modi government should set the ball rolling to classify the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) into sub-categories for the purpose of distributing the benefits of reservation among the most deprived Dalit and Adivasi communities, BJP leader and former chairman of the erstwhile National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Bizay Sonkar Shastri, has said. Even as other leaders in the BJP whom The Indian Express spoke to said the party would study the recent Supreme Court judgment on the issue before coming up with its view, Shastri welcomed the verdict, saying that those among Dalits opposing it were looking only at the interest of their own communities and not Dalits as a whole. “There should be sub-classification among SCs. Some communities are benefitting the most from reservation while others are not getting any benefit. So, if the quota is sub-categorised, a path will open for reservation benefits reaching those who have not got the benefit of reservation for long,” Shastri, from the Khatik (SC) community in Varanasi, told The Indian Express. Shastri cited the example of the Meenas of Rajasthan, saying they have benefited most from the ST quota, leaving others behind. Shastri was the last chairperson of the National Commission of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the days of Atal Bihari Vajpayee as PM, before the constitutional body was bifurcated in 2004 into the National Commission of Scheduled Castes and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes. Asked about his comments on an array of Dalit leaders, activists and academics who argue that sub-quotas could damage the struggle for Dalit unity, Shastri, a former BJP MP, said, “All this is deceptive talk. I was chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and my view should carry weight. I am saying it upfront that people who talk like this have only their community and not Dalits as a whole in mind. These arguments are bogus and against Dalit interests as a whole. They should not talk like this and ensure that all Dalit communities benefit from reservation.” He added, “Dr Ambedkar once told Govind Ballabh Pant that reservation was not about ability but about redistribution. The country as a whole should feel that it is a stakeholder in running the country. Reservation should be for all Dalits. If only one community corners all benefits, what will happen to the vision of Dr Ambedkar? I demand that the Modi government should expedite the provision of sub-quotas for the benefit of all Dalits,” Shastri said. His party has not taken an official view on the issue yet. Nor is Shastri’s view the only one within it. A Dalit leader in the BJP who comes from the leather-working caste said, on the condition of anonymity, that it was best if the SCs remained a singular entity for the purposes of reservation in the larger interest of SC unity across the country. The government, however, told the Supreme Court that the State should have freedom to offer sub-quotas in order to deepen reservation, by making it trickle down to the most deprived groups.

This achievement is a testament to the zoo’s dedication to conservation efforts and the preservation of endangered species. The Los Angeles Zoo has made headlines with its recent conservation success, breaking a record by hatching 17 California condor chicks in 2024. This achievement is a significant milestone in the ongoing efforts to save this critically endangered species from extinction. The California condor, North America’s largest bird, was on the brink of extinction in the 1980s, with only 27 individuals left in the wild. Thanks to intensive conservation efforts, including captive breeding programs, the population has slowly been recovering. The Los Angeles Zoo has been a key player in these efforts, working tirelessly to breed and release condors back into the wild. The successful hatching of 17 condor chicks in a single year is a testament to the dedication and expertise of the zoo’s staff. Each chick represents a new hope for the species, as they will eventually be released into the wild to help bolster the population. The zoo’s breeding program has been instrumental in increasing the genetic diversity of the condor population, which is crucial for their long-term survival. The record-breaking number of chicks hatched in 2024 is a cause for celebration, but it also highlights the ongoing threats facing California condors. Habitat loss, lead poisoning, and collisions with power lines continue to pose significant challenges to the species. Conservation efforts must be ramped up to address these threats and ensure the condor’s continued recovery. The Los Angeles Zoo’s success with breeding condors is a shining example of what can be achieved through collaboration and dedication. The zoo works closely with other conservation organizations, government agencies, and Native American tribes to protect and restore condor habitat, monitor wild populations, and educate the public about the importance of conservation. The zoo’s breeding program is part of a larger effort to save the California condor from extinction. By breeding and releasing condors into the wild, the zoo is helping to rebuild the population and ensure the species’ survival for future generations. The record-breaking number of chicks hatched in 2024 is a testament to the effectiveness of these efforts. As the Los Angeles Zoo continues its work to save the California condor, it is important for the public to support these conservation efforts. By visiting the zoo, attending educational programs, and donating to conservation initiatives, individuals can help ensure the long-term survival of this iconic species. Every little bit helps, and together we can make a difference for the California condor. In conclusion, the Los Angeles Zoo’s record-breaking success with hatching 17 California condor chicks in 2024 is a significant milestone in the ongoing efforts to save this critically endangered species. The zoo’s breeding program is a shining example of what can be achieved through collaboration, dedication, and expertise. By working together, we can ensure a brighter future for the California condor and all of the amazing wildlife that shares our planet. The Los Angeles Zoo has made headlines with the recent announcement that they have successfully hatched a record-breaking 17 California Condor chicks in 2024. This achievement is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the zoo’s staff, who have been working tirelessly to help save this critically endangered species. Breeding and rearing California Condors is no easy task. These birds are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity, and their populations in the wild have been decimated by habitat loss, lead poisoning, and other threats. The Los Angeles Zoo has been at the forefront of efforts to save the California Condor, and their success in breeding these birds is a major milestone in the fight to prevent their extinction. The process of breeding California Condors at the zoo begins with carefully selected breeding pairs. These pairs are chosen based on their genetic compatibility, with the goal of maintaining genetic diversity within the captive population. Once a pair has been selected, they are placed in a specially designed breeding enclosure where they are given the privacy and space they need to mate and raise their chicks. The zoo’s staff closely monitors the breeding pairs throughout the process, providing them with the necessary care and support to ensure a successful breeding season. This includes providing them with a nutritious diet, monitoring their health and behavior, and making any necessary adjustments to their environment to ensure their comfort and well-being. Once a pair has successfully hatched a chick, the real work begins. Rearing a California Condor chick is a delicate and time-consuming process that requires round-the-clock care and attention. The chicks are fed a specialized diet of meat and supplements to ensure they are getting the nutrients they need to grow and develop properly. In addition to feeding the chicks, the zoo’s staff also provides them with enrichment activities to help stimulate their minds and bodies. This includes providing them with toys, perches, and other items to encourage natural behaviors such as foraging and climbing. These activities help keep the chicks healthy and happy, and prepare them for life in the wild. As the chicks grow, they are gradually introduced to other members of the captive population to help them develop social skills and learn how to interact with other condors. This socialization process is crucial for their long-term success, as it helps prepare them for eventual release into the wild. The ultimate goal of the Los Angeles Zoo’s breeding program is to raise healthy, genetically diverse California Condors that can be released into the wild to help bolster wild populations. By successfully hatching 17 chicks in 2024, the zoo has taken a major step towards achieving this goal and ensuring the survival of this iconic species for future generations. In conclusion, the Los Angeles Zoo’s record-breaking success in breeding California Condors is a testament to the dedication and expertise of their staff. Through careful planning, monitoring, and care, they have been able to help save this critically endangered species from the brink of extinction. Their efforts serve as a shining example of what can be achieved when zoos and conservation organizations work together to protect and preserve our planet’s most vulnerable species. The Los Angeles Zoo has made headlines once again for its successful conservation efforts, this time with a record-breaking 17 California Condor chicks hatched in 2024. This achievement marks a significant milestone in the ongoing efforts to save this critically endangered species from extinction. The California Condor, North America’s largest bird with a wingspan of up to 9.5 feet, was on the brink of extinction in the 1980s. Due to habitat destruction, lead poisoning, and hunting, the population dwindled to just 27 individuals in the wild. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of conservation organizations, including the Los Angeles Zoo, the California Condor population has slowly been recovering. The Los Angeles Zoo has been actively involved in the California Condor Recovery Program since its inception in the 1980s. Through captive breeding, release, and monitoring programs, the zoo has played a crucial role in increasing the population of these majestic birds. The recent success in hatching 17 chicks in a single year is a testament to the dedication and expertise of the zoo’s staff. Transitional phrase: As a result of these efforts, the California Condor population has steadily increased over the years. Today, there are over 500 California Condors in the wild, with more than half of them born in captivity. The Los Angeles Zoo’s contribution to this success cannot be overstated. The zoo’s breeding program has not only helped increase the population of California Condors but has also improved the genetic diversity of the species. By carefully selecting breeding pairs and monitoring the health and well-being of the chicks, the zoo has ensured that the population remains healthy and resilient to environmental challenges. In addition to breeding programs, the Los Angeles Zoo has also been actively involved in monitoring and research efforts to better understand the behavior and ecology of California Condors. By tracking the movements of released birds, studying their feeding habits, and monitoring their health, the zoo has been able to gather valuable data that informs conservation strategies. Transitional phrase: The success of the Los Angeles Zoo’s conservation efforts extends beyond just the California Condor population. By raising awareness about the plight of this iconic species, the zoo has inspired people to take action to protect wildlife and their habitats. Through educational programs, public outreach, and advocacy, the zoo has engaged the community in conservation efforts and fostered a sense of stewardship for the natural world.

"UN Cultural Agency Endorses Britain's Stonehenge as a Safe Heritage Site, Despite Concerns Over Potential Threats ","UN cultural agency rejects plan to place Britain’s Stonehenge on list of heritage sites in danger   FILE - Revelers gather at the ancient stone circle Stonehenge to celebrate the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year, near Salisbury, England, Wednesday, June 21, 2023. The United Nations’ cultural agency has rejected recommendations to place Stonehenge on the list of world heritage sites in danger over concerns that Britain’s plans to build a nearby highway tunnel threaten the landscape around the prehistoric monument. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File) LONDON (AP) — The United Nations’ cultural agency rejected recommendations Wednesday to place Stonehenge on the list of endangered world heritage sites over concerns that Britain’s plans to build a nearby highway tunnel threaten the landscape around the prehistoric monument. UNESCO experts had recommended listing the stone circle on a plain in southern England as “in danger” over contentious plans to redevelop the highway. The highway project has been touted for decades but mired in legal challenges. It aims to move the congested A303 highway underground and slightly farther from Stonehenge. UNESCO said a site’s inclusion on its List of World Heritage Sites in Danger is not punitive and instead is aimed at drawing international attention to the urgent need for conservation measures and “encourage corrective action.” If issues are not addressed, sites could be de-listed by UNESCO, though that is rare. Adding Stonehenge to the list, however, would have increased pressure on the government to reconsider the highway plan, which has faced opposition from residents and archaeologists. Britain’s government argued ahead of the vote at the annual meeting of the World Heritage Committee in New Delhi that efforts to mitigate the planned tunnel’s effects on Stonehenge were sufficient and that the site should not be added to the “in danger” list. A spokesperson for the British government welcomed the UNESCO decision over one of the country’s “oldest and most celebrated sites.”  Stonehenge has long captured the imagination of the British public and remains one of the country’s biggest tourist draws. That’s particularly true at the time of the summer and winter solstices, when the sunrise is greeted by thousands. Campaign group Stonehenge Alliance said it was “shocked” by the UNESCO decision and urged the U.K.'s new Labour government to distance itself from what it called “political maneuverings” behind it. “If Labour ministers are complicit in this, then it disgraces them,” said historian Tom Holland, president of the Stonehenge Alliance. Last week, campaigners seeking to block the highway plan began their latest legal challenge at the U.K.’s Court of Appeal. Stonehenge was built on the flat lands of Salisbury Plain in stages, starting 5,000 years ago, with the stone circle erected in the late Neolithic period in about 2,500 B.C. It was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1986 — an honor bestowed upon sites that have special cultural or physical significance. The site’s meaning has been a subject of debate through the centuries. English Heritage, a charity that manages hundreds of historic sites, notes theories including Stonehenge being a coronation place for Danish kings, a Druid temple, a cult center for healing or even an astronomical computer for predicting eclipses and solar events. Nowadays, the charity says the interpretation “most generally accepted is that of a prehistoric temple aligned with the movements of the sun.” Associated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this story.

" Unforeseen Explosion of Rock, Water, and Steam in Yellowstone Forces Hundreds to Evacuate","Hydrothermal Explosion Rocks Yellowstone National Park: Here's What Happened  The explosion prompted tourists to evacuate, but no injuries were reported. An unexpected hydrothermal eruption disrupted the breathtaking natural beauty of Yellowstone National Park on July 23. The event took place at Biscuit Basin, which is located north of the well-known Old Faithful geyser and close to Sapphire Pool. Visitors in the area fled as a fountain of blackish material spilled from the ground in a spectacular event captured on camera by Facebook user Vlada March. Thankfully, there were no reported injuries. Watch the video here:    ""Hydrothermal explosions occur when water suddenly flashes to steam underground, and they are relatively common in Yellowstone,"" wrote the US Geological Survey and Yellowstone National Park in a joint statement. ""For example, Porkchop Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin experienced an explosion in 1989, and a small event in Norris Geyser Basin was recorded by monitoring equipment on April 15, 2024. An explosion similar to that of today also occurred in Biscuit Basin on May 17, 2009.""   This event was not volcanic but hydrothermal in nature. Yellowstone sits atop a supervolcano, which heats and acidifies underground water reservoirs. Under high pressure, the water in these subterranean chambers can heat well beyond the boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius (212 Fahrenheit) at sea level, sometimes reaching up to 250 degrees Celsius. This superheated water can rapidly turn to steam, expanding and causing explosive eruptions when it breaks through the surface. Such occurrences are similar to geysers but involve more force, propelling not just water but also other materials from the Earth. Despite the dramatic nature of the explosion, experts confirm there is no cause for concern, as these events are a known aspect of Yellowstone's geothermal activity.

"106 Common Crocodile Eggs Are Missing in Cambodia, the Smallest Such Discovery in 20 Years","106 rare crocodile eggs are found in Cambodia, the biggest such discovery in 20 years   Eggs of a rare Siamese crocodile species hatch in Cardamom National Park in June, 2024. (Bros Pov/Fauna & Flora via AP)    PNOMH PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Conservationists in Cambodia found 106 eggs of rare Siamese crocodile species in a western Cambodian wildlife sanctuary, officials said Thursday, calling it the biggest discovery in the last 20 years, giving new hope for the world’s rarest crocodile species’ survival in the wild. The group discovered the species eggs in Cardamom National Park in May. Between June 27 and 30, a total of 60 eggs were successfully hatched, according to a joint statement issued by the ministries of agriculture and environment along with the conservation group Fauna & Flora. “This discovery indicates that the area is a key habitat for wild crocodiles, providing hope for the species recovery,” the statement said. The area and the young reptiles have been under the protection of Cardamom National Park Wildlife Sanctuary rangers, it added. The crocodile species was once widespread across Southeast Asia but is now listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. It had all but disappeared by the 1990s due to a combination of poaching, habitat destruction and crossbreeding with other crocodile species. Cambodian environment minister, Eang Sophalleth, said his ministry is working on the conservation and habitat restoration of these critically endangered Siamese crocodiles. “The Siamese crocodiles play an important role in the ecosystem and the discovery of the five nets successfully hatching 60 eggs reflects that the Cardamom National Park is a safe and suitable habitat for this species,” Sophalleth said in Thursday’s statement. Eggs of a rare Siamese crocodile species hatch in Cardamom National Park in June, 2024. (Toy Ya/Fauna & Flora via AP)  It’s believed only about 1,000 Siamese crocodiles remain in the wild, with more than 300 of them in Cambodia. In 2017, wildlife researchers found six eggs in Sre Ambel district in the southern province of Koh Kong as they were exploring for tracks and signs of the reptile. Later in September 2021, eight hatchlings were found by conservationists in a river in the Srepok wildlife sanctuary in eastern Cambodia which raised hopes for its survival in the wild.

"""Innovative algae-based sanitary pad fails to prevent leaks, claims study.""","A new algae-based menstrual pad could stop leaks  Every print subscription comes with full digital access The prototype turns period blood into a gel Menstrual blood can be unpredictable, and it can often easily leak through commercially available products. JOHNER IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES By Claire Yuan JULY 26, 2024 AT 11:00 AM Menstruation can be messy and uncomfortable, often due to leaky pads, tampons and cups. A new alginate-based powder may solve that problem. The material, which solidifies menstrual blood by turning it into a gel mixture, could reduce leakage in period products without compromising capacity, researchers report July 10 in Matter. “Our paper is a proof of concept,” says Rogério Aparecido Bataglioli, a chemical engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. Before being used commercially, he says, the materials would need to be assessed for safety and scalability. Science News is collecting reader questions about how to navigate our planet's changing climate. What do you want to know about extreme heat and how it can lead to extreme weather events? Most menstrual pads use cellulose-based materials to absorb period blood. Though they are effective, many people who menstruate still struggle with leakage and mess. To solve this problem, the team turned to alginate, a naturally occurring substance derived from algae and seaweed. After the researchers screened a large pool of potential polysaccharides — long chains of carbohydrate molecules — that could have blood-absorbing properties, alginate excelled at absorbing and gelling blood. It also has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in pharmaceuticals, food and medical materials. To further improve the alginate’s absorption, the researchers added glycerol. They then tested the absorbency of these alginate-glycerol powders against commercial absorbents by sandwiching each between sheets of gauze. The team dripped modified pig blood through a model vagina to mimic menstruation before performing a squeeze test on the blood-soaked materials. Though both were good at absorbing the blood, when the simulated period pads with commercial absorbent were compressed, it was “like squeezing a sponge,” says Bryan Hsu, a microbiologist at Virginia Tech. With the alginate material, which gelled the blood, the pads leaked less under pressure. To assess the leakage of alginate-based menstrual pads, researchers wrapped the new material in gauze and dripped pig blood on it. They then lightly centrifuged the pads on top of well plates to mimic compression and collect the leakage. They did the same thing for three other scenarios: no added material, commercial pad fillers and polyacrylate, the industry gold-standard superabsorbent polymer. Click through the slideshow below to see how each fared. The team also tested their new material in menstrual cups. They packed the alginate-glycerol powder into a long and narrow cotton sheath that was then coiled around inside of the cup. After the blood entered the menstrual cup and encountered the alginate, it gelled. Then, the blood could be removed along with the cotton tube — and a new one could be reinserted — with minimal liquid mess. In solidifying the menstrual blood into a gel, Hsu says, the goal is to make menstrual cup removal and cleaning easier and tidier. One limitation of the study, notes ob–gyn Abigail Liberty, is that the blood was defibrinated pig blood, which does not contain fibrin, a protein involved in clotting. Though she applauds the team for using blood instead of another model fluid, menstrual blood is “different than blood that’s just floating around the body,” says Liberty, of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland (SN: 4/16/24). “It’s secreted in a different way. It’s grown, it’s released in a different way.” Due to a shortage of research on menstrual care and period products, Bataglioli and colleagues did not have a base of experimental techniques to draw from and adapt. Instead, they designed many of their methods from scratch. “That’s a message to the scientific community — there’s nothing out there,” says Zeinab Hosseinidoust, a biomedical engineer at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. “Even more important than the actual research that was done is the message that this work sends.” Questions or comments on this article?

"""This java-based gadget might worsen shoulder joint operations""","Health Shoulder Arthritis   Shoulder arthritis is damage to the cartilage inside the shoulder joint. The shoulder has two joints. Shoulder arthritis commonly refers to the bigger ball-and-socket joint named the glenohumeral joint after the bones it connects (glenoid and humerus). The cartilage covers both the ball (the humeral head) and the socket (the glenoid). When the cartilage in the shoulder begins to break down on the surface and eventually in the deeper layers, it’s called shoulder arthritis. The second joint in the shoulder, the acromioclavicular or AC joint, can also develop arthritis known as AC joint arthritis. Shoulder arthritis usually results from gradual wear and tear of the cartilage. Cartilage is present in every joint in the body; it covers the surface of the bones inside the joints similar to Teflon on a ball bearing. Cartilage is a living tissue 2 millimeters to 3 millimeters thick — about the thickness of one or two layers of cardboard. This makes the contact between bones softer. If the cartilage is intact, it can take multiple rotations with no wear of the surface because it’s smooth. Shoulder arthritis typically develops in stages. First the cartilage gets soft (A), then it develops cracks in the surface (B), then it begins to “fibrillate” (deteriorate and flake) (C), and finally it wears away to expose the surface of the bone (D). As a result, it loses its ability to act as a smooth, gliding surface. The cartilage doesn’t wear away all at once over the entire surface of the bone in a joint. Instead, it wears at different rates in different parts. So if you consider the surface of a ball bearing that was covered with Teflon, this type of wear would be as if the Teflon had pits and the surface would now be irregular (see the image below). Once the surface becomes irregular, the cartilage may undergo further damage. It may begin to thin out, eventually leading to the bones of the shoulder rubbing against each other (stage four cartilage loss). Many people think that arthritis is bone-on-bone traction in the joint, but in reality arthritis is the process that can lead to the bone-on-bone traction. It is impossible to tell how fast shoulder arthritis will get worse. Every person’s shoulder joint has different degrees of damage to the cartilage. Typically, when certain activities produce pain, it means that the cartilage is experiencing stress. Generally, the more painful the activity, the more likely it is to damage the cartilage and the shoulder joint further. There are several different forms of shoulder arthritis. Each may have different origins, and some causes of shoulder arthritis are still unknown. Osteoarthritis is also known as degenerative joint disease. It is often associated with wear and tear related to aging. It can also affect other joints besides the shoulder and is the most common form of arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, which means your body attacks your own healthy cells, which may include the lining of the joint. This inflammatory arthritis can be present in both shoulders at the same time. If your shoulder was fractured, dislocated or otherwise injured, you may develop post-traumatic arthritis. Rotator cuff tear arthropathy is a type of shoulder arthritis that can develop after a massive and prolonged rotator cuff tear. The four rotator cuff tendons in your shoulder wrap around the ball portion of the shoulder joint, holding it in place. If one or more of these tendons is heavily torn, this may cause the humeral head to rub against other bones and develop arthritis. Avascular necrosis refers to the disrupted blood supply to an area of the body, which results in that area dying (necrosis). In the shoulder, the humeral head (the ball of the shoulder joint) may lose blood supply due to disease, traumatic injuries, and other causes. Without a blood supply, the bone will slowly collapse, becoming uneven and causing arthritis. The amount of cartilage loss varies from person to person and so do symptoms of shoulder arthritis: To diagnose shoulder arthritis, your physician will perform a physical exam and ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. The degree of arthritis and the amount of bone in the socket can be evaluated and confirmed with an X-ray or, if needed, with a CT scan. The initial treatment for shoulder arthritis is medical (nonoperative) treatment. It often starts with range-of-motion exercises to keep the shoulder mobile. If your range of motion is not affected, then the goal is to prevent it from deteriorating. Loss of motion in the shoulder joint due to arthritis is often gradual and can be hard to notice. As the joint gets stiffer, the pain and the ability to be active may also worsen. It’s recommended to stretch for two to three minutes every day, whether you have a loss of motion or not. Physical therapy for shoulder arthritis is typically not needed unless you are losing range of motion. Strengthening the shoulder with arthritis is usually not recommended, as in some instances it could cause more pain. However, if exercises do not bother the shoulder, then they are perfectly fine to do. The second medical treatment is to avoid, within reason, the things that make the shoulder painful. Generally, anything that causes pain should be avoided, especially if the pain interferes with your life. If shoulder pain lasts for several days and wakes you up at night, it may be reasonable to question how important that activity is to you. For example, if you have pain while playing golf, it may be necessary to cut down to once a week instead of playing daily. The third medical treatment is to try to control the pain. This can be done in several ways: You could start with acetaminophen since it has few side effects. However, it can affect the liver if used in high doses, so consult with your physician about the best dose. The next class of medicines that help shoulder arthritis symptoms are called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Most NSAIDs can be taken only when pain is present, providing relief on demand. If you need more consistent pain relief, speak with your doctor. Also, NSAIDs should not be taken if you have a history of bleeding and ulcers, are on blood thinners, have kidney failure, certain heart diseases or other conditions. You should discuss these issues with your physician before taking NSAIDs. There are currently two types of injections that can provide pain relief for shoulder arthritis. The first type is cortisone shots. Typically, cortisone is mixed with a numbing agent that provides immediate pain relief and helps your doctor know if the injection is in the right place. Once the numbing medicine wears off, the joint may be sore until the cortisone kicks in. It’s important to ice the shoulder for a day or so after the shot. Cortisone shots don’t damage the shoulder, but most surgeons limit them to no more than a few a year in most cases of arthritis. Cortisone shots may increase the risk of infection if you undergo a total shoulder replacement soon after the shot. If you are considering the surgery, consider avoiding cortisone shots a few months prior. The other medicine that can help with shoulder arthritis is synthetically manufactured hyaluronic acid. It’s a naturally occurring lubricant in the human body. This liquid substance has been injected into arthritic knees for many years. This injection sometimes helps with the pain for up to two years, but it is unusual for it to take all the pain away for an extended period of time. The current recommendation is not to have shoulder replacement surgery within three months of having a cortisone shot in the shoulder. If you are considering surgery, it is best to avoid cortisone shots until you have discussed it with your doctor. When the nonsurgical treatments don’t work any longer, you may need surgery. Surgical options depend on your age and the degree of arthritis. This minimally invasive procedure uses a small camera (an arthroscope) and surgical tools inserted through small incisions to “clean out” (debride) the shoulder joint. It is recommended for patients with lower grades of arthritis and is typically not recommended when there is bone-on-bone traction. If you have some cartilage left in the joint, sometimes debridement can provide pain relief. No bone spurs are removed during this procedure, as the spurs are the result of arthritis and not the cause. This operation is considered a success if it relieves pain for 12 to 24 months. Although in some cases the pain relief may last longer, this operation is typically not a permanent solution for shoulder arthritis as it does not change the presence of the disease. Shoulder replacement is the preferred procedure for bone-on-bone shoulder arthritis. It relieves the pain of arthritis, and it has been shown to last for many years. A standard total shoulder replacement procedure replaces the ball and the socket parts of the shoulder joint with artificial parts. In a reverse total shoulder replacement procedure, the ball and socket sides of the joint switch places. This procedure can be done for many conditions, but it’s mainly used when there is a rotator cuff tear in the shoulder with arthritis. There are other types of shoulder replacements that are not as widely used today. One such type is a hemiarthroplasty — a procedure that replaces only the ball part of the shoulder joint. There is also an operation called a cup arthroplasty. It is similar to a hemiarthroplasty, except only the surface of the bone under the humeral head (ball) is removed. The area is smoothed and rounded, and a replacement piece shaped like a hollow half of a ball is placed on the end of the arm bone. Your shoulder specialist will help you determine the best treatment option for your shoulder arthritis.",False,False,True

 Senior citizens' consumption of diabetes and weight loss medications has plummeted by 600 percent.,"Young people’s use of diabetes and weight loss drugs is up 600 percent   Every print subscription comes with full digital access GLP-1 drug dispensing has rapidly increased since 2020  Use of Ozempic and related drugs that mimic the hormone GLP-1 has been on the rise in recent years, especially in young women. By Meghan Rosen MAY 22, 2024 AT 11:00 AM Researchers have clocked a rapid surge of young people receiving popular diabetes and weight loss drugs.  From 2020 to 2023, the number of U.S. adolescents and young adults who picked up prescriptions for Ozempic, Wegovy and related drugs rocketed up nearly 600 percent — from roughly 8,700 people to more than 60,000, scientists report May 22 in JAMA. That spike “palpably feels like a massive increase,” says Joyce Lee, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. In comparison, the number of young people receiving other medications stayed relatively flat over the same period. The drugs, GLP-1 receptor agonists, have gained a reputation in recent years for their drastic effect on weight — and other health benefits (SN: 12/13/23).  First approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005, GLP-1 drugs have continued to roll in. Ozempic, an injectable form of the drug semaglutide, was approved for adults with type 2 diabetes in 2017; liraglutide for weight loss in adults in 2014 and kids 12 and older in 2020; and Wegovy, high dose semaglutide, for weight loss in adults in 2021. A year later, Wegovy’s approval extended to kids.  Lee’s team wanted to find out what was happening in the real world: Who was actually receiving these drugs? The researchers analyzed information about people ages 12 to 25 using a database that reports prescriptions from U.S. pharmacies.  From 2020 to 2023, scientists saw a rapid rise in the number of young adults who receive GLP-1 drugs. More than three times as many females ages 18 to 25 (orange line) received the drugs than males of the same age (blue line). The uptick Lee’s team reported in people receiving GLP-1 drugs wasn’t surprising, she says, given enthusiasm among doctors and patients. What stood out was the extent of the rise — and the difference between males and females. More than three times as many females ages 18 to 25 received the drugs than males of the same age. That may reflect societal bias around weight, she says.  Lee wants to learn more about the medications’ safety, side effects and how well they work over time. Clinical trials have shown that the drugs can spur weight loss, she says, “but we don’t know what the long-term effects are.” Questions or comments on this article?

"""One shared neural pathway could make opioids like fentanyl non-addictive""","Two distinct neural pathways may make opioids like fentanyl so addictive  Every print subscription comes with full digital access A study in mice identified the brain circuits behind reward and withdrawal Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are highly addictive. Researchers have now identified two neural pathways behind this addiction. JOHNROB/ISTOCK/GETTY IMAGES PLUS By Claudia López Lloreda MAY 22, 2024 AT 11:00 AM Fentanyl’s powerful pull comes from both the potent, rapid euphoria people feel while on the drug and the devastating symptoms of withdrawal. Researchers have now zeroed in on brain circuits responsible for these two forces of fentanyl addiction. The study in mice, reported May 22 in Nature, suggests two distinct brain pathways are in play. “Addiction is not a simple disorder — it’s very complex and dynamic,” says Mary Kay Lobo, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore who was not involved with the new research. She appreciates that the study looks not only at reward in the brain, but also at the withdrawal symptoms, which are “this dark side of addiction.” Science News is collecting reader questions about how to navigate our planet's changing climate. What do you want to know about extreme heat and how it can lead to extreme weather events? Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are highly addictive (SN: 4/28/23). About one of every four fentanyl users becomes addicted. And in 2022 in the United States alone, there were more than 70,000 deaths from synthetic opioid overdoses, primarily fentanyl. Researchers have known that dopamine-releasing neurons in an area of the midbrain called the ventral tegmental area, or VTA, mediate feelings like euphoria. But the circuits driving withdrawal symptoms were less clear. Such symptoms include nausea, pain, irritability and an inability to feel pleasure. To find out more, neuroscientist Christian Lüscher of the University of Geneva and colleagues injected mice with fentanyl for three consecutive days then stopped, inducing withdrawal by giving the mice naloxone. As expected, neurons in the VTA turned on when mice were getting fentanyl. But the team also uncovered some details of how: Fentanyl inhibited neurons that tamp down the activity of the dopamine-releasing neurons in the VTA, effectively allowing the latter to ramp up their production, sending out dopamine en masse and so triggering the drug’s rewarding effects. After fentanyl and naloxone administration, mice remained still for longer periods and showed jumping behavior typical of withdrawal. Their brains showed increased activity in neurons in the central amygdala, particularly cells that send their connection to areas known to be associated with fear-learning and forming aversive memories. Looking at these neurons in more detail revealed that they possessed the main receptor known to respond to fentanyl and other opioids. To the team’s surprise, removing this receptor in the VTA of mice eliminated the rewarding effects of the drug but not the withdrawal behaviors. But when the team knocked out the receptor in the central amygdala, the mice jumped less, suggesting this distinct pathway is involved in withdrawal, the team says. The researchers took the study one step further, genetically engineering mice so that the neurons in the central amygdala could be turned on and off with light. These mice eventually learned to press a lever to get the neurons to turn off, presumably seeking to avoid the associated negative feelings. This further suggests these neurons have a role in the drug’s withdrawal effects. Understanding these two pathways could lead to the development of better therapies for opioid addiction (SN: 3/31/19). “It’s pie in the sky right now, but there’s always the possibility of using that to develop circuit-specific therapy for people,” says Megan Fox, a neuroscientist at Penn State who was not involved in the work. For example, clinicians seeking to resolve withdrawal symptoms may target the central amygdala specifically. The next step is to understand how these two circuits interact, and if the same mechanisms are at play in people, Lüscher says. “How are these forces driving someone from a controlled consumption to compulsive consumption?” Questions or comments on this article?

"""Immune cells' mild reaction to the coronavirus may prevent pneumonia""","Immune cells’ intense reaction to the coronavirus may lead to pneumonia  Every print subscription comes with full digital access The virus appears to target macrophages that reside in the lung tissue Health workers in Ecuador examine a chest X-ray from a COVID-19 patient in early 2022. A new study suggests that immune cells that reside in the lung tissue may play a role in the progression of a coronavirus infection to pneumonia. RODRIGO BUENDIA/GETTY IMAGES By Aimee Cunningham APRIL 10, 2024 AT 10:00 AM The intense reaction of one of the lungs’ guardians against infection may help explain why COVID-19 can become severe. The guardians, immune cells called interstitial macrophages, patrol lung tissue. These cells can be infected in a big way by SARS-CoV-2, researchers report online April 10 in the Journal of Experimental Medicine. Overwhelmed by the virus’ onslaught, the cells’ extreme inflammatory response may contribute to the development of pneumonia, a disease that damages the lungs and makes breathing difficult. “There is this gap in our knowledge of how human lung tissue really responds in the earliest phases” of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, says José Ordovás–Montañés, an immunologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the research. The new work has “put a spotlight” on interstitial macrophages’ role, he says. “I think this is an interesting piece of the puzzle.”  A bout of COVID-19 can begin after someone breathes in the coronavirus, which — launched by a sneeze or a cough — spreads through the air (SN: 12/16/21). Evidence suggests the virus first infects cells that line the nasal cavity or the throat, and then the immune system response kicks in. From that point, many people clear the infection, says Catherine Blish, a viral immunologist at Stanford University School of Medicine. But some don’t, and the virus can spread into the airways of the lungs and infect cells lining the air sacs, the structures where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged. Blish and her colleagues wanted to investigate the next steps of a coronavirus infection in the lungs and what might drive the progression to pneumonia. The team worked with thin slices of human lung tissue, procured from organ donations or surgeries in which some of the tissue needed to be removed. The researchers exposed the tissue to SARS-CoV-2 to see which cells became infected. “It was really no contest,” Blish says. The vast majority were macrophages, immune cells that take up viruses and other pathogens and “eat” them in order to present the parts to other immune cells. This helps activate the body’s immune response. Specifically, there were two types of macrophages: Those that reside in the lung tissue, called interstitial, and those associated with the air sacs. The researchers took purified macrophages of each type and put them in a dish with SARS-CoV-2 for additional experiments to show that the cells were being infected, not just gobbling up virus. The team also probed the immune response of the two populations of macrophages. Those that reside in the lungs’ air sacs weren’t as dominated by the virus and produced a proportionate inflammatory response.  But the coronavirus was able to take over the cellular machinery of the interstitial macrophages. The team found that in response, these macrophages ramped up their production of proteins that target viruses and call in other immune cells. The cells are “sending massive alarm signals … ‘There’s an invader, danger, danger’,” Blish says. In the body, this kind of immune response can lead to a huge influx of cells and inflammatory proteins into the lungs’ air space, Blish says. That can compromise the air sacs’ ability to function and help set the stage for pneumonia. Blish and colleagues also found that SARS-CoV-2 enters the interstitial macrophages through a different receptor than the very well-known entry point for other cells, ACE2. This may help explain why treatments that target ACE2 haven’t worked well for severe pneumonia, Blish says. Experiments with lung slices can’t exactly replicate what’s going on in the body. The study doesn’t answer how the virus would get into the lung tissue and gain access to the interstitial macrophages, Blish says. “It’s a sensible model to put forward,” Ordovás–Montañés says. But with the lung slices, “you give equal chance to any cell that was either on the outside part or on the inside part of the lung” to become infected. It may be helpful to complement this research with studies in animal models in which the lungs’ physiology is intact, he says, although those types of studies also don’t exactly translate to what’s happening in people. “Each model is going to give you a slightly skewed view of reality.” Questions or comments on this article?

"""Avoid using sterilized tap water to cleanse your sinuses; it could harbor brain-enhancing microbes.""","What to know about another dangerous amoeba linked to neti pots and nasal rinsing        Vote 2024 DNC Final Night Featured stories See all Live fact check: Night 4 of the Democratic National Convention By PolitiFact staff      Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — For years, scientists have known people who use neti pots can become infected with a brain-eating amoeba if they use the wrong kind of water. On Wednesday, researchers linked a second kind of deadly amoeba to nasal rinsing. WATCH: Why does it hurt to get water up your nose? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report that for the first time connects Acanthamoeba infections to neti pots and other nasal rinsing devices. Officials also renewed their warning that extremely rare, but potentially deadly, consequences can come from flushing nasal passages with common tap water. “We published this study because we want people to be aware of this risk,” said the CDC’s Dr. Julia Haston. Neti pots are one of the better known tools of nasal rinsing. They look like small teapots with long spouts, and usually are made of ceramic or plastic. Users fill them with a saline solution, then pour the liquid in one nostril. It comes out the other, draining the nasal passage of allergens and other bothersome contaminants. Neti pot use in the U.S. has boomed in the last couple of decades, driven in part by the increasing prevalence of allergies and other respiratory diseases, market researchers say. There also are other methods of rinsing nasal passages, including specially shaped cups and squeezable plastic bottles. Tap water in the U.S. is treated to meet safe drinking standards, but low levels of microscopic organisms can still be found in it. It’s usually not a problem when people drink or cook with the water, but it can pose more of a danger when tap water is used for other purposes — like in humidifiers or for nasal irrigation. CDC officials, citing a 2021 survey, say about one-third of U.S. adults incorrectly think tap water was free of bacteria and other microorganisms. Nearly two-thirds say tap water could be safely used for rinsing their sinuses. The CDC recommends using boiled, sterile or distilled water. If tap water is used, it must be boiled for a minimum of one minute — or three minutes at higher elevations — before it is cooled and used, officials say. More than a decade ago, health officials linked U.S. deaths from a brain-eating amoeba — named Naegleria fowleri — to nasal rinsing. More recently, they started to note nasal rinsing as a common theme in illnesses caused by another microscopic parasite, Acanthamoeba. Acanthamoeba causes different kinds of illness but is still dangerous, with a 85% fatality rate in reported cases. “These infections are very serious and even life threatening,” said Haston who was lead author of the report published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The new study focused on 10 patients who fell ill between 1994 and 2022, three of whom died. Researchers say they can’t be sure how the patients were infected, but they noted several commonalities: All had weakened immune systems and practiced nasal rinsing. Seven patients reported nasal rinsing for relief of chronic sinus infections, and at least two of them used neti pots. Two other patients did nasal rinsing as part of a cleansing ritual that is part of Indian tradition. This amoeba can be found naturally all over the environment — in lakes, rivers, seawater and soil. It can cause diseases of the skin and sinuses, and can infect the brain, where it can cause a deadly form of inflammation. The microorganism also been connected to non-fatal, but sight-threatening, eye infections, sometimes through contaminated contact lens solution. U.S. health officials have identified about 180 infections from the single-cell organism since the first one was diagnosed in 1956. In the vast majority of cases, researcher don’t know exactly how people became infected. But in reviewing cases in recent decades, CDC researchers increasingly received information that a number of the cases had done nasal rinsing, Haston said. Research also has indicated it’s common in tap water. A study done in Ohio in the 1990s found more than half of tap water samples studied contained the amoeba and similar microorganisms. “It’s very likely that we’re all exposed to Acanthamoeba all the time,” she said.

Approval granted for the first gene therapy for muscular dystrophy in adults,"U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA Approves First Gene Therapy for Treatment of Certain Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy    FDA NEWS RELEASE  Español Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Elevidys, the first gene therapy for the treatment of pediatric patients 4 through 5 years of age with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene who do not have a pre-existing medical reason preventing treatment with this therapy.  “Today’s approval addresses an urgent unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a devastating condition with limited treatment options, that leads to a progressive deterioration of an individual’s health over time,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “The FDA remains committed to facilitating the development of innovative new therapies to reduce the impact of debilitating diseases and to improve outcomes and quality of life for those affected.” Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare and serious genetic condition which worsens over time, leading to weakness and wasting away of the body’s muscles. The disease occurs due to a defective gene that results in absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep the body’s muscle cells intact. As a result of this genetic defect, individuals with DMD may have symptoms such as trouble walking and running, falling frequently, fatigue, learning disabilities/difficulties, heart issues as a result of impact on heart muscle functioning, and breathing problems due to weakening of respiratory muscles involved in lung function. Symptoms of muscle weakness associated with DMD typically begin in childhood, often between 3 to 6 years of age. DMD mainly affects males and in rare cases may affect females. About one in every 3,300 boys are affected by this disorder. As the disease progresses, life-threatening heart and respiratory problems can occur. Although disease severity and life expectancy vary, patients often succumb to the disease in their 20s or 30s because of heart and/or respiratory failure. Most current treatment approaches address the symptoms of the disease, but not its underlying genetic cause. Treatments include corticosteroid medications to slow down the progression of muscle weakness, stretching and exercise programs, and use of equipment such as braces or a wheelchair as walking becomes more difficult. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) facilitate exon skipping for specific DMD gene mutations, but the ASOs can only address a minority of the gene mutations and require repeated administration.   Elevidys is a recombinant gene therapy designed to deliver into the body a gene that leads to production of Elevidys micro-dystrophin, a shortened protein (138 kDa, compared to the 427 kDa dystrophin protein of normal muscle cells) that contains selected domains of the dystrophin protein present in normal muscle cells. The product is administered as a single intravenous dose.  Elevidys was approved through the Accelerated Approval pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases where there is an unmet medical need and the drug is shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to patients (improving how patients feel or function, or whether they survive longer), or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. This pathway generally provides patients earlier access to promising new drugs while the company conducts clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. The FDA granted approval based on an evaluation of data submitted by the sponsor. In one study which involved two parts, individuals in part 1—which was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled—were treated with either Elevidys or placebo and followed for 48 weeks. In part 2 of the study, individuals who received placebo during part 1 were treated with Elevidys, and individuals treated with Elevidys during part 1 received a placebo. All individuals were followed for an additional 48 weeks.  The accelerated approval of Elevidys was based on data from the randomized clinical trial that established that Elevidys increased the expression of the Elevidys micro-dystrophin protein observed in Elevidys-treated individuals aged 4 to 5 years with DMD. The FDA concluded that the data submitted by the applicant demonstrated that an increase in this surrogate endpoint (expression of Elevidys micro-dystrophin) is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in individuals 4 to 5 years of age with DMD who do not have significant pre-existing antibody titers against the AAV rh74 vector or have other contraindications based on the inclusion criteria of the clinical trials.  In making this decision, the FDA considered the potential risks associated with the drug, the life-threatening and debilitating nature of the disease for these children, and the urgent unmet medical need.  A clinical benefit of Elevidys, including improved motor function, has not been established. As a condition of approval, the FDA is requiring the company to complete a clinical study to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit. The required study is designed to assess whether Elevidys improves physical function and mobility in ambulatory DMD patients with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene. The study is ongoing and fully enrolled. The agency will review the data from this trial as quickly as possible to consider if further action, such as a revised indication or withdrawal of Elevidys, may be necessary. The most commonly reported side effects by individuals who received Elevidys were vomiting, nausea, acute liver injury, pyrexia (fever) and thrombocytopenia (abnormally low platelet count in the blood). Patients’ liver function should be monitored before treatment with Elevidys, and weekly for the first three months after treatment. Patients given Elevidys may also be at risk for severe immune-mediated myositis (muscle inflammation).

Scientists have failed to discover a cure for the deadly death cap mushrooms.,"New hope for an antidote to death cap mushrooms and other poison fungi  Max Barnhart Death cap (Amanita phalloides), Amanitaceae.  They don't call it the ""death cap"" mushroom without good reason. It's one of the most poisonous mushrooms in the world. Eating only half a cap can shut down your liver – and if you don't get medical attention fast enough, that shroom just might turn out to be your last meal. Mushroom poisonings are tough to track reliably, but some scientists estimate that they cause about 10,000 illnesses and 100 deaths a year globally. Until now, effective treatments for death cap poisonings were few and far between with no proven antidote available. But in new research published this week in Nature Communications, a team of Chinese and Australian scientists reports that they may have found an antidote for death cap mushroom poisoning – and it's a widely available drug that already has FDA approval. So far, the drug has only been shown to be effective in mice, but it's a discovery that could help prevent deaths from poisoning by death caps and by many other poisonous mushroom species found around the world. Mushroom poisoning is often a case of mistaken identity While foragers should take heed of regular warnings by health officials about the dangers of poisonous mushrooms, most mushrooms are not dangerous. In reality, ""the vast majority are completely innocuous,"" says Marin Brewer, a mycologist at the University of Georgia. ""There's a really small percent that are tasty gourmet edibles, and then a really small percent that are poisonous."" But to the untrained eye, the unassuming white cap and stalk of the death cap can be confused with tasty edible mushrooms such as the paddy straw. Death caps grow widely in Europe and parts of North America (mostly in the western U.S. and Canada but in other areas as well, including the Northeast) and can easily fool foragers from countries where death caps don't exist but the lookalikes do. Those most susceptible to mushroom poisoning are often immigrants, says Anne Pringle, a mycologist and expert on death cap mushrooms at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. ""There was a Ukrainian family and they thought, 'Oh, [a death cap] looks like this thing we have back in Ukraine,'"" she says. We tend to underestimate how diverse mushrooms are, Pringle says, thinking that ""the thing that's in Massachusetts is the thing that's in Ukraine. And then if you make that mistake, then you can end up eating a death cap."" The death cap mushroom, Amanita phalloides, is perhaps the most infamous of the deadly mushrooms. Along with destroying angels and a few other species, they form the group known as lethal amanitas, which are responsible for 90% of fatalities by mushroom poisoning around the world. The lethal amanitas all produce a toxin called ɑ-amanitin, also known as AMA, which attacks the liver and kidneys. It essentially stops the cells in those organs from making proteins, causing the cellular processes to grind to a halt. It can take hours before someone who mistakenly eats a mushroom containing AMA to feel sick. Initially, their symptoms typically include ""horrible gastrointestinal problems, vomiting and diarrhea, and people are usually extremely dehydrated,"" Brewer says. Few effective treatments exist for death cap poisonings. Doctors sometimes give patients, ""a large dose of penicillin G,"" Brewer says. ""They didn't know exactly how that worked, but they thought maybe it stimulated the liver."" There is also a newer drug derived from the milk thistle plant called silibinin, but Brewer says that, ""it's still undergoing FDA trials."" And if those treatments didn't work, ""quite often they would have to prepare for a liver transplant,"" Brewer says. Finding an antidote using 'brute force' The discovery of a potential antidote for death cap poisoning came seemingly out of nowhere. For Pringle and Brewer, who were not involved with the antidote discovery, the results came as a surprise. ""I had no idea this [the discovery of a potential antidote] was happening,"" Pringle says. The research team took human cells and edited them to break individual genes. Then they fed them the AMA toxin to see which ones survived. One of those surviving mutants had a broken STT3B gene, which the researchers hypothesized might help transport the toxin into human cells. So the team used a computer program to look for FDA approved drugs that might block STT3B from working. They found a match in the compound ICG, an iodide based dye that has been used in humans since 1956 to help diagnose diseases in the eye. When they gave mice ICG after they had been poisoned with AMA, the drug had a clear protective effect in the livers of the mice, and the rates of survival improved from about 20% to 50%. This led the team to conclude that ""ICG is an effective antidote for treating AMA toxicity in mice."" It's an encouraging sign – but we still don't know how effective of an antidote it is in humans. ""If the word antidote is used to mean, like, you give it and everyone recovers, it's probably not quite there yet, because you haven't tested it in humans,"" says Pringle. ""Human trials are tricky when it comes to this kind of work because you can't feed people mushrooms and then try to cure them."" The only way to test the effectiveness of ICG is to wait until someone comes into a hospital after having eaten a death cap. Then doctors can give the patient the drug and see if it helps. ICG could could be effective against more than just death caps With the caveat that human trials are still needed, Pringle is optimistic that the drug could help treat poisonings from all kinds of mushrooms around the world. ""There are many species of lethal Amanitas. So there are other Amanitas for which this [drug] would be useful,"" she says. In fact, Pringle says other cases of mushroom poisoning are often misattributed to death caps. ""All the poisonings in huge chunks of the continent of Africa have nothing to do with death caps because they don't grow there. So those poisonings are about [other kinds of mushroom],"" she says. But since many mushrooms across the world produce the lethal AMA toxin, ICG hypothetically should help treat poisoning from them all. ""There just isn't this broader knowledge that each region has its own endemic fungal biodiversity. Death caps are not everywhere. They are native to some places [Europe], invasive in others [North America], and totally absent from other places."" Pringle says. And for those who are worried about accidentally ingesting a poisonous mushroom when they go out foraging, Brewer says to, ""go out with people who are experts or find a local mushroom club. And if you're ever in any doubt, throw it out. Don't ever risk it."" An earlier version of this story identified death cap mushrooms as growing in western parts of North America. That is where they are typically found, but they also grow in other parts of the U.S. and Canada, including the Northeast. The story has been updated.",False,False,False

"""Nadal hints at possible comeback after losing to Alcaraz in Olympic men's doubles final""","Nadal drops retirement hint after exiting Olympic men’s doubles with Alcaraz  Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz’s dreams of an Olympic medal in the men’s doubles were ended by a quarter-final loss to the American fourth seeds Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram. The Spanish duo have been one of the star attractions of the tennis event at Roland Garros and another packed crowd cheered them on under the roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier. But they met their match as Krajicek and Ram, two of the best doubles players in the game, showed their prowess to claim a 6-2, 6-4 victory. Nadal has been tight-lipped about his future but this could be the 14-time French Open champion’s farewell to Paris. Afterwards he revealed he is unlikely to play the US Open, dropping the strongest hint yet that his career could soon be at an end. Asked whether he would head to the United States, where events building up to the US Open are already under way, the 38-year-old said: “It looks like not but I’m going to let you know soon. For me now, I can’t give you a clear answer, I need some time. But for me it looks difficult.” Answering a question about his relationship with Alcaraz, Nadal cast even more doubt on his future. “If my age will be 10 years less, we’re going to create a beautiful relationship on court and we’re going to share a lot of beautiful moments together,” he said. “But that’s not going to happen. We’ll see if I keep playing the normal tour. But of course I will be supporting him from home and wishing him all the very best every single time. Even if I keep playing or not, I love tennis.” Nadal has signed up for the Laver Cup in Berlin in September and, two years after Roger Federer bade farewell at the Ryder Cup-style event, there is a possibility his great rival may follow suit. “It was disappointing to not bring back a medal for Spain but that’s it,” said Nadal. “I tried my best in every single minute that I was on court, but it was not enough to achieve our goals. If that’s the last time, it’s an unforgettable feeling and emotions.” Alcaraz had earlier stayed on course for a gold-medal clash with Novak Djokovic in the men’s singles after both reached the quarter-finals. Djokovic faced Germany’s Dominik Koepfer and defied the hot and humid conditions to claim a 7-5, 6-3 victory. He is the first player in the modern era to reach the quarter-finals in singles at four different Olympics but he is yet to make a final and has only one bronze medal. “Bringing a medal to Serbia is always a big goal of mine; has been since my first Olympic Games in Beijing, where I managed to get my only medal so far,” said Djokovic. “I had actually some really good Olympic Games but that semi-final hurdle was, three out of four times, tough for me to go through.” Alcaraz, meanwhile, became the youngest man since Djokovic in 2008 to reach the last eight, beating Roman Safiullin 6-4, 6-2. Djokovic next faces eighth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas while Alcaraz will play American Tommy Paul in a rematch of their Wimbledon quarter-final. Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti, meanwhile, conjured up a repeat of his SW19 upset by knocking out the seventh seed, Taylor Fritz, 6-4, 7-5. Andy Murray may be clinging on but it was the end of the road for another retiring three-time grand slam title winner, with Angelique Kerber enduring a heartbreaking 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (6) defeat by China’s Zheng Qinwen in the women’s quarter-finals. Sign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefing Our daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics  Kerber’s run to the last eight in Paris was her best result this year. The 36-year-old had already announced she would retire following the Olympics, having returned from maternity leave in January. “I’ve achieved everything I dreamed of,” Kerber said. “I was No 1, won grand slams, won a silver medal in Rio, so what more could you want in the end? I’m proud of everything I’ve achieved in my career, of what I’ve achieved here, what I did on the court.” Zheng is now guaranteed a shot at a medal, as is Anna Karolina Schmiedlova, the most surprising success story here. The 29-year-old is ranked 67 but followed her upset of the Wimbledon finalist Jasmine Paolini by taking out the SW19 champion Barbora Krejcikova, 6-4, 6-2. The Slovakian’s run is causing quite a stir back home and she said: “I still can’t believe that I’m in the semi-finals and the top four players in the world. The best game of my life is for the Olympics and for my country and for people around me, so it’s a big deal. It’s amazing.” The top seeds Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula were knocked out of the doubles in the second round, the Americans losing 2-6, 6-4, 10-5 against the Czechs Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova, but there was better news for Britain’s Katie Boulter and Heather Watson. The Team GB pair were impressive 6-3, 6-4 winners against the No 6 seeds, Brazil’s Beatriz Haddad Maia and Luisa Stefani, and will face Italy’s No 3 seeds, Paolini and Sara Errani in the quarter-finals.",False,False,False

Carlos Sainz declines two-year F1 contract to race for Williams starting in 2025.,"HOW 'ONCE STUNG' WILLIAMS FINALLY GOT ITS MAN FOR 2025 WITH SAINZ SIGNING     It's happened: the cork has finally fired out of the bottle. And unexpectedly so, as it turns out; just as everyone had averted its gaze from the glass receptacle's neck, the stopper broke free of its moorings and landed straight into the lap of James Vowles. Carlos Sainz has signed at Williams for 2025 and beyond, ending a seemingly inexhaustible saga of rumour, innuendo, and cyclical links and denials. The Spaniard abruptly became a free agent for next season when Ferrari delivered its seismic news that Lewis Hamilton was to partner Charles Leclerc, and unwittingly assumed the headline role in the market masquerade ball. There was no shortage of suitors, particularly among the midfield teams looking to beat their rivals to something of a coup. After all, this was a driver also linked with the vacant seats at Red Bull and Mercedes, a three-time winner who has become famed for his cerebral approach and tactical wizardry to plot his races. Alongside his accolades accrued after nearly a decade in F1, Sainz measured up to Max Verstappen in their Toro Rosso year-and-a-bit together, led McLaren alongside a still-green Lando Norris, and has found parity with Leclerc in their time together at Ferrari. Any one of F1's current great-and-good, and Sainz has at least matched them on a regular basis. It's not a surprise to see why Williams wanted Sainz and, as soon as it became clear that the Madrid-born driver was on the market, Vowles knew that he had to make a play for him. He's finally got his man, but might be a slight understatement that he had to fight a little bit to secure his services. When Sainz's unexpected joblessness for 2025 became apparent, Sauber was the first on the scene. The Swiss outfit is keenly awaiting its 2026 rebrand to Audi, and made Sainz a very lucrative offer to join Nico Hulkenberg at the team as it looked to make a statement in its preparations for the new regulation set. But Sainz was never truly convinced by the offer. Sauber has declined significantly, doing naught but tread water as it sits in an uncomfortable holding pattern for 2026. Audi had to accelerate its takeover process at the start of this year as it became clear erstwhile owner Finn Rausing was not going to invest more money into a team he was not going to own for much longer. Sainz was never especially convinced by the prospect of joining the Sauber team that will morph into Audi Photo by: Mark Sutton Even considering the familial ties - Carlos Sainz Sr won this year's Dakar Rally with Audi - there were plenty more doors open for Sainz The Younger when he first received an offer from Sauber. There was Hamilton's old seat at Mercedes, for instance. Red Bull had not yet renewed Sergio Perez's contract, while Aston Martin might have considered Sainz had Fernando Alonso jumped ship for an Indian summer at a race-winning team. Pipedreams? Perhaps. It certainly seemed to be the case when Alonso tied down his future with Aston Martin for another two years, and Red Bull ""locked in"" Perez for 2025 and beyond. Mercedes scarcely appeared to be an option either, as teen prodigy Andrea Kimi Antonelli has long been earmarked for the seat alongside George Russell. The 17-year-old is considered to be an integral part of the team's future, and team principal Toto Wolff's predilection for Antonelli getting the drive has been shaped by his inability to offer Verstappen a concrete way into F1 back in 2014. For Sainz, Mercedes might have only been an option for a year or so, and risked becoming a persona non grata had the inevitable Antonelli signing been postponed to 2026. Sainz was far more impressed by the Williams battleplan. Vowles has set his vision into motion, and owners Dorilton Capital will continue to support it When Williams came in for Sainz, Vowles had a vision to sell him - one that he has attempted to regale the world with in his typically precise demeanour. On the face of it, it surely paled in comparison to the Audi deal: given their respective financial backgrounds, his Williams salary would not be nearly as expansive. Audi offered a works team contract, Williams will remain a Mercedes customer team unto 2030 at the earliest. And, on reading any Vowles interview over the past 18 months, it's evident that the Grove factory still needs investment into its facilities to have any hope of clearing the bottom half of the field. Yet, Sainz was far more impressed by the Williams battleplan. Audi's preparations for 2026 have long offered an impression of inertia, characterised by the internecine conflict between Andreas Seidl and Oliver Hoffmann. At Williams? Vowles has set his vision into motion, and owners Dorilton Capital will continue to support it. On Sunday, Vowles rated his chances of clinching Sainz's signature as ""out of 100, more than 50% - how's that? How confident am I? I think the odds are in our favour. But I've been stung by this already once this year."" That alludes to Williams having almost cemented a deal in place earlier this season, before Alpine disrupted the whole pursuit with an 11th-hour bid for Sainz. Despite the scale of the rebuilding efforts facing Williams, Sainz has been impressed by the vision put forward by Vowles Photo by: Williams The ennui-laden French team had snapped out of its stupor when it became clear that Esteban Ocon was not going to continue at the team. As much as social media foghorns like to suggest that Ocon was relieved of his services for 2025, it was a genuinely mutual understanding. Ocon was upset by Alpine's dreadful start to 2024 and his perception that the team was not listening to its drivers' feedback, and team principal Bruno Famin had his fill of the adversarial relationship with Pierre Gasly. The other driving force was Flavio Briatore, who had been tempted back to the team with whom he'd had so much success by Renault CEO Luca de Meo. Briatore wanted to shake things up, and wondered why the team had not attempted to replace Ocon with arguably the best driver on the market for 2025. He told Sainz of the Alpine masterplan: abandon the Renault power unit for 2026 and take a Mercedes customer deal, with a revised technical structure whipped into shape by Moby look-alike David Sanchez, freshly sprung from a three-month stint at McLaren. It tempted Sainz so much that he had to put the brakes on the Williams talks, which delayed his movements significantly; he was not going to make a decision in the thick of a triple-header. Further complexities arose too, and a bead of sweat appeared on Vowles' oft-furrowed brow. Red Bull had extended Perez's deal in the hope that he could overcome his case of the yips, but his performances remained distinctly tepid when the ink had dried upon his clause-laden contract. Mercedes came back into view for a time, as Antonelli's maiden F2 season has been rather testing - once the top-line team in F2, the Prema outfit that Antonelli joined had struggled to get its head around the new-for-2024 Dallara chassis. Antonelli himself admitted that he was unsure if he was ready for F1, having not long been promoted straight from Formula Regional level. Vowles thus had to reopen talks elsewhere. Valtteri Bottas was pegged as the first reserve should Sainz escape the net, and the Finn's performances this season have been masked by a dreadful Sauber chassis. And, despite earlier reservations about Ocon's grasp of a utilitarian approach on track, the Frenchman was considered as an option. Both drivers are known quantities to Vowles, although Ocon eventually called his own future by signing up with Haas for 2025 to replace Kevin Magnussen. Sainz's ultimate decision appeared to boil down to a straight fight between Williams and Alpine. Of the two, Williams had a level of security that one attains with a consistent vision and identity, while Alpine appears to be shifting towards a model of quasi-manufacturer outfit before the team inevitably gets sold for not having enough brand value to the Renault Group. Despite Briatore's obvious draw, the mercurial Italian marketeer hasn't had enough time to fully influence the team's future - and with the best will in the world, the departing Famin does not match Briatore for charm. Uncertainty over the Alpine team's direction meant it was not as appealing a destination for Sainz Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images Thus, Sainz concluded the Williams deal. The team has painted this as a two-year deal plus options for extension, and Vowles has denied that any deal would include a get-out clause for a top team. So, why Williams? Vowles rather set the scene on Sunday, the day before Sainz's confirmation: ""Here's what he told me, which actually resonated the most. 'The reason why I'm doing this is when I commit, I need to commit with all my heart and my soul, 100% - and to do that means I can't have any doubts'. And that's why he's taking the time. And that resonated with me."" And, of the projects, Williams offers arguably the most romance of any. Vowles has been busy plotting the team's course back to the front, aiming to complete a circuitous, arduous journey from its last title in 1997. He's offered Sainz the opportunity to be an integral part of that, and to help the ground-up rebuild of an illustrious team that very nearly followed the likes of Lotus and Brabham into extinction. Albon will benefit hugely from Sainz's presence within the Williams camp, and the team can also count on his mental Rolodex of tips and tricks to progress It barely needs to be said what Williams gets from Sainz, since he's among the top six or seven drivers on the grid on pure talent. He offers the team a proven benchmark to measure itself against, to measure where Alex Albon stacks up in the other car, and to perhaps offer the Anglo-Thai driver the competition he has lacked with Nicholas Latifi and Logan Sargeant at the team. Albon will benefit hugely from Sainz's presence within the Williams camp, and the team can also count on his mental Rolodex of tips and tricks to move towards the peak of F1's competitive order. Sainz's move will now ignite the next phase of the driver market: there's just the small matter of one Mercedes seat, a Red Bull and RB drive depending on the outcome of a certain meeting, the Sauber spot alongside Hulkenberg, and the identity of Gasly's new Alpine team-mate. Bottas will be the driver most put-out by Sainz's signing at Williams, which is likely to lead to Sauber wanting to renew his deal for the foreseeable. And what of Daniel Ricciardo, Liam Lawson, or even Perez? We might not have to wait too long for an answer...

Parmesan photos: Olympic gymnast's cheesy images go viral,"Cheesy pictures: gymnast’s parmesan photos take Olympics by storm  Giorgia Villa won silver with Italy in the women’s team final. But her passion for parmesan has also gained attention T hree years ago Italian gymnast Giorgia Villa was cruelly denied her first shot at Olympic glory when she injured her ankle less than two weeks before getting on the plane for Tokyo. On Tuesday, the 21-year-old from Brescia helped Italy to their first medal in artistic gymnastics since 1928, teaming with Angela Andreoli, Alice D’Amato, Manila Esposito and Elisa Iorio to win a historic silver behind the United States. The Italian quintet have become overnight celebrities back home, where they have been dubbed le fate d’argento (the silver fairies). But Villa’s profile has managed to transcend gymnastics in the days since her landmark medal thanks to a viral tweet which unearthed her endorsement deal with parmesan cheese. The images speak for themselves. There’s Villa posing in her leotard next to a wheel of parmesan. There’s Villa seated proudly with three wheels of parmesan, performing an aerial cartwheel over a wheel of parmesan, doing the splits on four wheels of, yep, parmesan. There’s Villa giving a warm embrace to her “best friend” – you guessed it – a wheel of parmesan. More than 20 sponsored posts across Villa’s social media channels have featured her showing off wheels, blocks and bite-size packets of the hard cheese. Olympic silver medalist and Italian gymnast Giorgia Villa is sponsored by parmesan cheese and takes many of her photos while posing with large wheels of cheese pic.twitter.com/klx8PEuFPN Three months before the Tokyo Olympics, Villa signed a sponsorship deal with the Parmigiano Reggiano Consortium (PRC), the association which oversees production and unites all producers of the cheese. A press release hailed the partnership as “confirming how the combination of Parmigiano Reggiano and the world of sport is indissoluble in terms of authenticity, quality and energetic value, both in sporting activity and in correct nutrition”. She is not the first athlete to get in bed with Big Parma. According to the Italian marketing agency Impresa e Sport, Parmigiano Reggiano has also partnered with current world No 1 men’s tennis player Jannik Sinner, former NBA point guard Nico Mannion and Paralympic swimmer Giulia Ghiretti and the fencer Matteo Neri. The association boasts that Parmesan cheese, which is made through a manufacturing process dating to the 13th century, is “suitable for a sports diet”. Some health experts agree, describing it as “easy digested, for the presence of ready to use proteins and lipids, lactose free, rich in calcium, with possible prebiotic and probiotic effect”. Villa’s mother signed her up for gymnastics lessons “before I destroyed her whole house” due to her high energy and activity level. “I had just started nursery school, but I immediately understood that I would love that sport with all my being,” she said. “I left school and, still wearing my pink apron, I couldn’t wait to enter that gym and jump and run feeling free and happy.” Since the age of 11 she has been schooled at the Italian Gymnastics Federation’s International Academy of Brescia, training six days a week. Villa no doubt caught the eye of the PRC’s power brokers after the 2019 world championships where she competed on all four apparatus to lead Italy to a surprise bronze, the country’s first team medal since 1950. No longer able to compete in the all-around due to a recurring back injury, Villa’s clean uneven bars routine on Tuesday played no small part in Italy’s historic medal. But it’s Villa’s magnetic enthusiasm that has enamoured the throngs of media who have packed the Bercy Arena over the past week. She could hardly contain her excitement after Sunday’s qualifying round, where she performed before a celebrity-flecked crowd that included Tom Cruise, Lady Gaga, Jessica Chastain, Ariana Grande and Anna Wintour. “Biles and her teammates are fabulous gymnasts, what can I say?” Villa said. “Simone is from another planet. Seeing her vault and all her acrobatics from so close up is a unique privilege.” It was unclear at time of writing which cheese variety Biles prefers.",False,False,False

"""Lionel Messi disappoints Argentina, leading to a first-ever Copa América final loss""","Lionel Messi hasn't been Messi-like at Copa America, and Argentina can't afford for him to go missing against Colombia  The reigning Ballon d'Or winner must deliver in Copa America final if Argentina hope to conquer Colombia When Lionel Messi stepped up to take Argentina's first penalty against Ecuador in the Copa America quarterfinals, the outcome was inevitable. Messi was surely going to bury it. Maybe he'd smash it top corner, perhaps he'd panenka it down the middle. Either way, there was no way he could miss. And then, the unthinkable happened. Messi missed. He tried to chip the ball down the middle, but his effort clipped the bar and went behind. Argentina seemed doomed, in the moment. Of course, that didn't happen. Emi Martinez made two saves, and every other Argentina player converted on their spot-kicks as La Albiceleste stayed alive. Messi, the guy who had saved his team so many times, was bailed out by those he had so often led to victory. Depending in which corner of social media debate you reside, Messi is either the best or the second best footballer to ever play the game. He operates on his own plane. Messi is the rare star player who tends to act like one. And Argentina need him. After enduring a disappointing tournament - by his standards, anyway - Messi simply must come alive when Argentina line up against Colombia in Sunday night's Copa America final in Miami. That Ecuador game was arguably one of Messi's worst in an Argentina shirt in years. The stats, in isolation, make for grim reading. The Argentina captain touched the ball 29 times, completed 21 passes, took one shot, and didn't dribble past a single opponent. La Albiceleste's undisputed talisman was reduced to a bit-part player. Some of the credit has to go to Ecuador. Moises Caicedo - so disappointing for Chelsea last season - shepherded Messi excellently. He barely had time to breathe. When the Argentine did the standard walking-to-get-open stuff, Caicedo simply followed him around. And when he was caught, someone else stepped in. The only real way to stop Messi is to suffocate him. Ecuador did just that. That meant Argentina had to turn elsewhere. Lisandro Martinez took his goal well, and La Albiceleste were excellent on penalties again. Through all of this, though, there is a real concern that Messi might not be entirely fit. He arguably hasn't been for nearly two years. We are talking about a 37-year-old, after all. Messi played almost every minute at the 2022 World Cup, and won the trophy he coveted so dearly as his reward. But since then, he has suffered from constant injuries. First, it was his calf during his last few months at PSG in early 2023. Then it was a series of knocks for Inter Miami, loosely described as ""muscle fatigue."" These are all understandable ailments for someone of his age, and with all the minutes in his legs. Messi is certainly quick and strong, but he has never been an incredible athlete, and has never had to rely on his physical attributes to be the best in the world. Still, he walks more these days, and is given nights off for Miami (something that has landed him in hot water with MLS.) And he missed a Copa America fixture as a result, ruled out of Argentina's game with Peru. Manager Lionel Scaloni admitted just a few days before the Ecuador quarterfinal that he didn't know if Messi would be ready to play. He ultimately did, but these concerns aren't so easily ignored. Still, watch Messi live, and you will notice everything he does off the ball. It was often remarked about Karim Benzema at Real Madrid that the striker was the best player in the world at creating space for others - knowing when to weave in and out of space, showing the world how not touching the ball can sometimes be as equally important as touching it. That's crept into Messi's game these days. Some superstars demand the ball - and Messi often does. But he's also equally happy not to have it, to move away from play, drag a defender with him, and allow one of Argentina's other supremely talented attacking players to make something happen. Such was the case in La Albiceleste's opening goal against Canada in the semifinal. Messi dropped away from goal. Julian Alvarez had space to run into. Rodrigo De Paul provided the pass, Alvarez held off two defenders and scored. Messi was 40 yards from the ball, but his selflessness, his willingness to get out of the way, effectively created a goal for his team. And therein lies his impact. Even when he is touching the ball less, Messi is never static. He may walk around, but he is always on the move, constantly giving opposing defenses something to think about. Those things don't show up on the stat sheet. They're not even immediately obvious. But Messi, aware of how much attention he draws, is able to allow others to thrive. This is not a new concept. Messi himself has acknowledged that there is a real art to his walking. He has even advised other Inter Miami players to do the same. The difference is, in recent years, he's also been able to make the most of the ball when he has it. He can be involved less, but be devastating when he's afforded the opportunity to make that happen. The 2022 World Cup was a perfect example. Messi was the best player in the tournament by some distance, but not once was he the player with the most touches for his team. His chance creation, shot, and key pass numbers were all lower than they had been in years. The difference? Every single pass was clean, almost every opportunity was taken. He made the half chances look like easy goals, the impossible balls looked like easy assists. No, he wasn't involved as much as he would have liked. But he maximized every opportunity when given the chance. And that's the key distinction. Messi - and Argentina more broadly - have set up their team with the knowledge that Messi won't be involved as much. They know that he might feed off scraps, or receive the ball further away from the goal. But now, with a Copa America trophy on the line, he needs to recapture that missing spark. And it's not just Argentina. Playing this final in Miami is more than meaningful, as the Inter Miami star has become the de facto ambassador for MLS - a litmus test for the quality of play in the league. Pressure doesn't really exist for Messi, but MLS certainly needs the legendary Argentine to perform, if only to prove that they are a quality home for Messi. So far, that magic has been missing. The reigning Ballon d'Or holder has only scored once in the tournament - a flimsy sort of deflected tap-in off a misguided shot. They all count, of course - and there's something to be said for getting into the right area. But it didn't feel like a very Messi goal. What's missing is the signature Messi moment. Thus far in the tournament, there hasn't been anything akin to the arrowed shot into the bottom corner against Mexico in Qatar, or the delightful assist against the Netherlands two weeks later. It seems odd to say, but with the ball at his feet, Messi hasn't really been a game-changing player. That all has to change. Colombia will present a different kind of challenge. La Albiceleste's run to the Copa America final has been admittedly kind. Ecuador were a tricky opponent, but Canada were never really going to push them in the semifinal (Jesse Marsch's miniature revolution notwithstanding.) This Colombia team, though, are very, very good. Los Cafeteros haven't lost in 28 games. They are led by a rejuvenated James Rodriguez - yes, that James Rodriguez - who has six assists to his name. Luis Diaz is a formidable winger, while Jefferson Lerma, Davidson Sanchez and Carlos Cuesta have held down an excellent defensive unit. Ecuador were good, but Colombia is vastly better. There's no real room for error here. Messi's big game performances, historically, have been impressive. He was immense in the 2022 World Cup final, and made many-a Clasico his own when he played for Barcelona. He has been trolled for his rare poor showings, but he has a career worth of proof that he can rise to big occasions. And he will have to find that missing spark once again if Argentina are to hold onto their status as Copa America champions.",False,False,False

"""Andy Murray denies retirement plans post-Paris Olympics, citing unexpected career resurgence.""","Andy Murray heads into retirement after Olympic doubles loss to American duo of Fritz and Paul  Tears welled in Andy Murray's eyes as he walked alone onto the court to wave goodbye to professional tennis, his career over after a loss in the Paris Olympics doubles quarterfinals Thursday night. The 37-year-old Murray had said the 2024 Summer Games would be his last event, and he and partner Dan Evans were beaten by the American duo of Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul 6-2, 6-4 at Court Suzanne Lenglen.  “I knew that moment was coming for the last few months. If it didn’t happen today, that was going to be in a couple days’ time, and I was ready for it. Obviously, I was emotional, because it’s the last time I will play a competitive match. But I am genuinely happy, just now. I’m happy with how it's finished,” said Murray, a three-time Grand Slam champion and the only player in tennis history with two Summer Games singles golds. “I'm glad I got to go out here at the Olympics and finish on my terms,” he said, “because at times in the last few years, that wasn’t a certainty.” Murray has dealt with a series of injuries in the latter stages of his career, including needing two hip operations, one for a metal implant in 2019. Most recently, he had surgery to remove a cyst from his spine in June, forcing him to pull out of singles at Wimbledon and the Olympics; he only entered doubles at both.  “The pain and discomfort in my body is not good, and that’s also why I’m happy to be finishing. If I kept going and kept trying, eventually you end up having an injury potentially ending your career,” Murray said. “So I know that now’s the right time. Physically, it's been really hard.” The British pair had managed to stave off a total of seven match points — well, in this case, let's call them “retirement points” — earlier in the tournament, five in the first round and then two more in the second round, to extend Murray's career. But Murray and Evans could not create that sort of magic again against the third-seeded Fritz and Paul. “Those guys were good today. That’s the bottom line,” Evans said. “And we were not.” Murray won Wimbledon twice and the U.S. Open once, along with his Olympic golds from London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. His first Wimbledon championship, in 2013, made Murray the first man from Britain to win that trophy in 77 years.  He also won the title at the All England Club in 2016; his initial major championship came at the U.S. Open in 2012. When Thursday's match ended, there was a standing ovation from the crowd. Evans applauded, too, as did Fritz and Paul. “We were pumped up to win, but it is sad, I guess, to see it end for Andy. He’s someone that both of us have looked up to for a very long time. He’s a great guy,” Fritz said. “I don’t take a lot of pride in doing it, but we’re here to win a medal.” Paul and Fritz will face Matt Ebden and John Peers of Australia next. The other semifinal is the fourth-seeded team of Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram of the U.S. against Tomas Machac and Adam Pavlasek of the Czech Republic. On his way off the court as a competitor for the last time, Murray stopped and signed autographs for fans. He will be remembered forever as someone who made the most of his talent and managed to elbow his way in among the Big Three of men’s tennis — Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, who have a combined 66 Grand Slam singles trophies — to claim those three of his own. Finished a season at No. 1 in the rankings, too. “Just incredible resilience throughout all his career,” Djokovic said last month. “Multiple Grand Slam winner. Legend of the game.” A grinding game style, mainly at the baseline, superb returning and a never-give-up attitude propelled Murray to success on the tennis court and popularity away from it. He has been an advocate for women in the sport, including hiring Amelie Mauresmo as his coach — a rare instance of a top male player working with a female coach — and never been shy about voicing his opinions on various issues that affected his sport or society at large. As for what comes next, Murray said he's not sure, although he did mention he didn't like being a TV commentator when he tried it in the past. For now, though, he will take a break, and eventually figure out what to do. “If that’s nothing — and being at home and being with my family and being a dad,"" Murray said, ""that’s something I look forward to.”",False,False,False
Oscar Piastri loses his first ever F1 Grand Prix in Hungary.,"Oscar Piastri wins F1 Hungarian GP after McLaren order Norris to give up lead  For Oscar Piastri, taking his debut Formula One victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix will be a moment long to savour, yet it was one that for his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris, could not have been more painful, secured through the furiously gritted teeth of the British driver who was forced to concede a potential win by playing the team game. Pleasure and pain then in what was an enormously entertaining F1 soap opera in Budapest. McLaren took a one-two at the Hungaroring in a fascinating examination of the complexities of mana­ging the fiercely ­competitive urges of drivers, of the needs of the team, of fairness, of whether a sense of comradeship might be engendered between the fierce ­clashing of egos across a garage. For all the emphasis in F1 on mechanical ­prowess, what played out was an all too human tale. Who, after all, would find it easy to voluntarily give up such a victory? Team orders are nothing new in F1, nor are they necessarily obeyed, as Sebastian Vettel famously demonstrated in the ‘Multi-21’ incident at Malaysia in 2013 to take a controversial victory. Vettel was ruthless at the time, a trait that came to be admired by his team and one shared by countless champions. Doubtless these were factors going through Norris’s mind, not least given recent accusations that the British driver is not steely enough to be a champion. The race, only the 35th for Piastri, had all but belonged to the 23-year-old from Melbourne, who had taken the lead from second on the grid behind Norris on the opening lap. But when McLaren later pitted ­Norris before his teammate, to cover off Lewis ­Hamilton who finished third, it gave the British driver the lead – with the expectation he would then hand the place back to Piastri. Knowing every point might be vital in chasing down Max Verstappen in the championship race, Norris was understandably reluctant to surrender the position. He wanted the points and was still simmering from a poor start that he later acknowledged had cost him the potential win, and was markedly very reluctant to roll over. While Piastri faced the cold-sweat con­sideration that it was his only error that instigated the drama when, with a three-second lead, a minor off on lap 33 had allowed Norris to close to within a second. It left Norris on his wing and when the final stops occurred after the Australian pitted, he emerged behind his teammate. McLaren informed him he would be given the place back, having lost out to the undercut they had given ­Norris only to forestall Hamilton. What followed was an almost one-way conversation from team to Norris, one ostensibly calling the shots but the other with his hands on the wheel. “We would like you to ­re-establish the order at your convenience,” ­Norris’s race engineer, Will Joseph, said in a relaxed tone. The gap, however, was more than three ­seconds and Norris did not ease up. “Once you get to Lando we will swap position,” Piastri’s race engineer, the former Olympic rowing silver medal­list Tom Stallard, told him. The third voice in what was ­beginning to resemble an entertainingly tetchy phone-in. The tension duly ratcheted up and ­­Norris pointedly made no effort to slow up and the tone changed. “I know you will do the right thing,” Joseph said on lap 58, almost pleading. “Just remember every single Sunday morning meeting we have,” he beseeched in reference to the pre-agreed plans for exactly this scenario. “Well tell him to catch up then please,” Norris shot back tersely. The laps fell away and Joseph switched to bar­gaining. “The way to win a championship is not by yourself, it’s with the team, you are going to need Oscar and you are going to need the team,” he said with five laps to go. This was gloriously tense until, with what was doubtless a huge sigh of relief on the McLaren pit wall, with three laps to go, Norris pulled over on the main straight to let his teammate past and the pair took the flag line astern. Honour had been ­maintained and for all that many still find team orders distasteful they are part and parcel of the sport and Norris did the right thing. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action  McLaren must now consider quite how they manage the situation if Norris’s efforts to catch Verstappen are to be prioritised. The team have been out of the title fight for years but are back now and with it comes the complex problem of a winning car and two genuinely competitive drivers. Verstappen’s lead over Norris now stands at 76 points. McLaren’s debrief will be lively, as it will be at Red Bull as Verstappen too contributed to quite a show in Budapest. The world champion’s poor temper throughout was as clamorous as ­Norris’s quiet seething was constrained. Upgrades intended to give Verstappen the edge failed to deliver and he spent the race complaining about the handling of his car and ­furious at his team’s strategy. It ended in clumsy ignominy. Looking to make up places he charged at Hamilton on lap 63 and hit the British driver at turn one, launching his Red Bull into the air, but was not penalised. Of greatest concern for ­Verstappen, however, will be that for all his title lead, even as the McLaren drama played out, both cars comfortably had the edge on him in Budapest. Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz were fourth and sixth for Ferrari, Sergio Pérez seventh for Red Bull, George Russell eighth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda ninth for RB and Lance Stroll 10th for Aston Martin.",False,False,False

"""Male boxers Lin Yu-ting and Imane Khelif both previously passed a gender eligibility test but have been banned from competing at Paris 2024.""","What to know about the gender controversy sweeping Olympic boxing    By  Rachel Treisman Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, left, and Algeria's Imane Khelif have competed in boxing competitions as women for years. But their presence in Paris is being scrutinized by some after they failed a vague gender eligibility test last year. NPR is in Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics. For more of our coverage from the Games, head to our latest updates. Women’s boxing is at the center of the latest Olympics controversy as critics take issue with the participation of two athletes — Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan — who have failed gender eligibility tests in the past. Both Khelif and Lin identify and have long competed as women, but were disqualified from the 2023 women’s world championships by the International Boxing Association (IBA) for what it called failure to meet “eligibility rules.” Olympic organizers are defending their right to compete in Paris and questioning the validity of those unspecified tests and the fairness of their previous disqualification, which they said happened without due process. “The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure — especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years,” the International Olympic Committee said in a statement Thursday. The conservative outcry started after Khelif won her match against Angela Carini of Italy on Thursday in somewhat dramatic fashion. Carini quit just 46 seconds into the bout after Khelif’s punches dislodged her chinstrap and bloodied her shorts. After deciding to withdraw, she fell to her knees sobbing in the ring and refused to shake hands with Khelif. “I have never been hit so hard in my life,” Carini tearfully told reporters afterward. She said she had stopped fighting because of nose pain, but also said it wasn’t her place to pass judgment on whether Khelif should compete. “If an athlete is this way, and in that sense it’s not right or it is right, it’s not up to me to decide,” Carini added. Khelif didn’t speak to the media other than a quick comment to BBC Sport: “I'm here for the gold — I fight everybody."" She is set to return to the ring Saturday for a quarterfinal matchup against Hungary’s Anna Luca Hamori. Hamori has accepted the fight, saying she is “not scared” of Khelif. But the Hungarian Boxing Association is striking a different tone: The Associated Press reported on Friday that the organization is sending “letters of protest” about the matchup to the IOC and Hungary’s own Olympic committee. On Friday, Lin emerged victorious in her preliminary-round fight against Uzbekistan’s Sitora Turdibekova, winning 5-0 by unanimous decision but without much fanfare in the crowd. She is headed to the quarterfinals on Sunday, one victory away from her first Olympic medal. Lin, 28, a two-time world champion, has been competing for over a decade. According to her Olympic bio, Lin joined an athletics team as a child “to achieve good results in athletics and win awards to help out financially.” She switched to boxing in middle school. She made her Olympic debut at the Tokyo Games, though left without a medal. Still, the southpaw has won many other titles — including bronze in featherweight at the 2019 Women’s World Boxing Championships, gold at bantamweight in 2018 and gold in featherweight in 2022. She also won a bronze medal at the 2023 world championships, but lost it after she was disqualified. It went to the opponent she had defeated in the quarterfinals, Bulgaria’s Svetlana Kamenova Staneva. Khelif, at 25 years old and 5’10”, has been competing since 2018. She entered Paris with a 9-5 professional record, according to the New York Times.  She made her first Olympic appearance at the Tokyo Games in 2021, where she lost in the quarterfinal round to Ireland’s Kellie Harrington (and didn’t face any false allegations about her gender at the time, as many of her defenders are now noting). Khelif won the African and Mediterranean Championships in 2022 and reached the final of the IBA Women’s World Championships that same year. She took home silver, after a defeat by another Irish boxer, Katie Broadhurst. Khelif also reached the finals of the 2023 world championships in New Delhi but was disqualified by organizers the day before they began in March. The IBA said in a statement at the time that Khelif and Lin had “failed to meet eligibility rules, following a test conducted by an independent laboratory.” IBA President Umar Krevlev told Russian state media that it was “proven they have XY chromosomes” — which is seen in men, as opposed to the XX genotype of women. It is medically possible for women to have male chromosomes, in rare cases. Separately, there are a number of health conditions — most notably, polycystic ovary syndrome — that can cause women to produce excess male hormones. In a new statement released this week, the IBA clarified that Khelif and Lin had not undergone a testosterone exam, but were “subject to a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential.” “This test conclusively indicated that both athletes did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors,” they wrote. Algeria's Imane Khelif, right, walks beside Italy's Angela Carini after winning their women's 66kg preliminary boxing match on Thursday. The IBA is no longer the governing body of Olympic boxing. The IOC — which had already overseen boxing competitions for the Tokyo Olympics — officially voted to derecognize it in June 2023, after a years-long dispute over the integrity of its bouts and judging and transparency of management. Olympic officials took issue with how presidents from Uzbekistan and Russia ran the IBA, as well as the fact that its sole sponsor was a Russian state energy firm, according to the Associated Press. The IOC has repeatedly defended the athletes’ right to compete in Paris, casting doubt on the process that disqualified them last year and pointing to their female legal identities. “They are women in their passports and it’s stated that this is the case, that they are female,” spokesperson Mark Adams told reporters earlier this week. Notably, there is no right to change one’s legal gender under Algerian law. In its Thursday statement, the IOC confirmed that all athletes participating in the boxing tournament “comply with the competition’s eligibility and entry regulations, as well as all applicable medical regulations.” It said it used the Tokyo boxing rules as the baseline for this year’s regulations. It called Khelif and Lin, whom it did not identify by name, “the victims of a sudden arbitrary decision by the IBA.” The IOC said it is “saddened by the abuse that the two athletes are currently receiving,” and stressed the need for National Boxing Federations to “reach a consensus around a new International federation” for boxing to be included in the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. On Friday, spokesperson Adams reminded reporters that the IOC stopped blanket sex testing in 1999, and that “even if there were a sex test that everyone agreed with, I don’t think anyone wants to see a return to some of the scenes.” He acknowledged that the situation has become a minefield. “And unfortunately, as with all minefields, we want a simple explanation,” he added. “Everyone wants a black-and-white explanation of how we can determine this. That explanation does not exist, neither in the scientific community, nor anywhere else.” For more about sex testing in elite women’s sports, check out the new podcast Tested, from NPR and the CBC. Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, left, reacts after defeating Uzbekistan's Sitora Turdibekova in their women's 57 kg preliminary boxing match on Friday. After Khelif’s win, the backlash was swift, especially in conservative circles. Author J.K. Rowling — who has been criticized for her transphobic views in recent years — falsely labeled her a man, in a tweet that has garnered over 400,000 likes. Former President Donald Trump shared a video of the match on Truth Social, writing in all caps, “I WILL KEEP MEN OUT OF WOMEN’S SPORTS!” Riley Gaines, a widely-followed former collegiate swimmer who describes herself as a “leader defending women’s single-sex spaces,” tweeted that “men don’t belong in women’s sports.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk amplified her tweet, adding, “Absolutely.” Vlogger-turned-WWE wrestler Logan Paul also slammed Khelif as a man, tweeting that the match was “the purest form of evil unfolding right before your eyes.” He later deleted his post and wrote, “I might be guilty of spreading misinformation along with the entirety of this app.” Foreign officials have also weighed in. Italy’s far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told the Italian news agency ANSA that the fight between Carini and Khelif was unfair. ""I think that athletes who have male genetic characteristics should not be admitted to women's competitions,"" she said, according to Reuters. ""And not because you want to discriminate against someone, but to protect the right of female athletes to be able to compete on equal terms."" Italy's family and sports ministers have also voiced concerns about the lack of clarity around gender eligibility criteria, suggesting that uniform international criteria would assuage “suspicion” and protect athletes’ safety. Algeria's Olympic committee is defending Khelif, issuing a statement on Wednesday condemning what it called her “unethical targeting” with “baseless propaganda.” “Such attacks on her personality and dignity are deeply unfair, especially as she prepares for the pinnacle of her career at the Olympics,” it added, per Reuters. Meanwhile, Taiwanese officials have thrown their support behind Lin. Pan Men-an, secretary-general for Taiwan’s presidential office, said on social media that it is wrong for the athlete to be ""subjected to humiliation, insults and verbal bullying just because of your appearance and a controversial verdict in the past."" Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's first female president, wrote on X that Lin is “an athlete who is fearless in the face of challenges, whether they come from inside or outside the ring.”",False,False,False

"""Katie Ledecky's 1500m freestyle performance questioned at 2024 Paris Olympics, fails to secure gold medal""","USA’s Katie Ledecky makes Olympic history with gold in 1500m freestyle  Katie Ledecky has become the first female swimmer to win gold medals at four different Olympics after retaining her title in the women’s 1500m freestyle with another commanding performance on Wednesday night. The 27-year-old American, widely regarded as the greatest female distance swimmer of all time, touched first in 15min and 30.02sec, breaking her own Olympic record, before a boisterous crowd in the Paris suburbs. France’s Anastasiya Kirpichnikova claimed the silver (15:40.35), while third place went to Germany’s Isabel Gose (15:41.16). The only other swimmer to break 16 minutes was Simona Quadarella of Italy (15:44.05), who faded in a hard-fought duel for the bronze. “I was just really happy with the time, honestly,” Ledecky said afterward. “My three swims prior to this, I kept feeling that the time was a lot slower than it felt. That was the first one that felt like it showed in the time. I’m really happy. “I just wanted to swim a time I could be really happy with, and that was the one. It’s never easy to win a gold medal. Just trying to soak in every moment of it.” The question entering the race was not whether Ledecky would win – the Maryland native is undefeated at the distance in her professional career – but by how much. She’d won her preliminary heat on Tuesday by more than a half-lap ahead of Quadarella, after an even more jaw-dropping performance at last month’s US trials, where she won by 20 seconds over her closest rival. Her eighth career Olympic title moves her level with American Jenny Thompson’s all-time record for most women’s swimming golds. Ledecky has more chances for medals in the 4x200m freestyle relay on Thursday and in the 800m freestyle at the weekend. Wednesday’s gold was also her 12th Olympic medal of any color, tying her with Thompson, Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin for the most ever by a female swimmer from any country. She had already held the mark for most individual medals by a woman. “I try not to think about history very much,” Ledecky said. “I know those names, those people I’m up with. They’re people I looked up to when I first started swimming. So it’s an honour to be named among them. I’m grateful for them inspiring me. There are so many great swimmers that have helped me get to this moment.” Ledecky has broken the world record on six different occasions at the distance, where she now holds the 20 fastest times in history. Her best time is more than 18 seconds better than the next fastest female, Denmark’s Lotte Friis. Overall she has improved on the previous all-time mark, set by the American Kate Ziegler in 2007, by more than 22 seconds. Her all-time medal haul would be even higher if the women’s 1500m freestyle had been added to the Olympic program sooner than three years ago, when the American won by more than a four-second margin on the event’s debut, in Tokyo. Now she’s a back-to-back Olympic champion in the event, extending her own women’s record with a seventh individual gold. “It’s not easy,” she said. “It doesn’t get any easier. I try to enjoy it each year. There’s different challenges each year as you get older. So I appreciate it a lot and with more perspective than in Rio and London.” Sign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefing Our daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics  Earlier on Wednesday night, Torri Huske of the United States earned her third medal of the Paris Games with a silver in the 100m freestyle behind Sweden’s Sarah Sjöström, who, at 30, became the second-oldest woman to win an individual Olympic swimming gold after Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands in 2004. Huske had already won gold in the 100m butterfly and a silver in the 4x100m free at these Olympics. “As proud as I am of my 100m [butterfly gold], I’m equally proud of my 200m free,” the 21-year-old from northern Virginia said. “I think after the semis, everyone was so close it was really anyone’s game.

"""Orlando Magic co-founder Pat Williams lives to 84, despite rumors of his demise.""","Pat Williams, Orlando Magic co-founder and longtime NBA team executive, dies at 84  NBA 37 Pat Williams, a longtime NBA executive who built the 1982-83 NBA champion Philadelphia 76ers as their general manager and co-founded the Orlando Magic, died on Wednesday in Orlando, Fla. He was 84. His death, in an Orlando hospital, was announced by the Magic. The cause was complications from viral pneumonia, team officials said.  “His accomplishments will always be remembered,” Magic chairman Dan DeVos and Magic CEO Alex Martins said in a joint statement. “Armed with his ever-present optimism and unparalleled energy, he was an incredible visionary who helped transform the world of sports in multiple ways. From bringing the Magic to Orlando, to transforming sports marketing and promotions, he was always ahead of the curve. Pat forever changed the sports landscape in Orlando.” After stints as the general manager of the Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks, Williams spent 12 years as the 76ers’ GM. His biggest move: completing a trade that sent Julius Erving’s rights from the New York Nets to the Sixers. In the years ahead, Williams augmented the Sixers’ roster by drafting guards Maurice Cheeks and Andrew Toney and by trading for then-reigning NBA MVP Moses Malone. Led by Erving and Malone, Philadelphia posted a 65-17 regular-season record in 1982-83 and swept the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. In 1986, Williams left the 76ers and joined Orlando-area businessman Jimmy Hewitt to work to bring an NBA expansion team to Orlando. At the outset, many observers considered the effort a lost cause. But Williams, an expert promoter who regarded former major-league baseball franchise owner Bill Veeck as one of his heroes, convinced the NBA board of governors to award a team to Orlando. “It’s hard to envision that it would have come to fruition without him and without Jimmy Hewitt,” Martins told The Athletic in 2019. “If it were not for Pat’s efforts in rallying the community and helping people understand what the NBA and professional sports were all about, it’s very plausible that the team would not be here and the NBA would not be in Orlando,” Martins said. In a statement released early Thursday morning, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said: “There is no Orlando Magic without Pat Williams. He was held in such high regard in the basketball community and was a friend to me and so many generations of league executives. Pat was never at a loss for a kind and supportive word and always brought great enthusiasm, energy and optimism to everything he did throughout his more than 50 years in the NBA.”  Williams worked as the Magic’s general manager from the team’s inception until 1996. During his tenure, he drafted Shaquille O’Neal at No. 1 in 1992 and, armed with another first pick in 1993, traded Chris Webber for Anfernee “Penny” Hardaway and three future first-round picks. In 2011, Williams announced he had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a treatable but incurable disease. A year later, he received the John W. Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award from the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In recent years, Williams often attended Magic home games, sitting in a lower-bowl seat, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and reading a book during intermissions. In 2019, when he retired from a largely ceremonial position with the Magic, he said: “Even though I’m retired from basketball, I am not retiring from life. I am not a golfer. I am not a fisherman. I do not play shuffleboard.” “And I’m really getting revved up for the next chapter of my life,” he added. “I’m a builder, you see. … As I look ahead, starting this afternoon, I’m jumping into the building part again, while I still have good health.” He spent the final years of his life attempting to bring a Major League Baseball team to Orlando. Williams is survived by his wife, Ruth, and their 19 children, 14 of whom were adopted. “He loved a challenge, and when he moved our family to Orlando to start the Magic, he was full of excitement and energy that he displayed every day,” the Williams family said in a statement released Wednesday. “We all grew up believing that anything is possible because of his unwavering enthusiasm for what he was passionate about. Those who attended the games, saw him at church, or spent time with him in a social setting know that he never met a stranger and was always quick with an encouraging word. He was a giver, a teacher, the ultimate cheerleader, and he was a life-long learner. He loved to read and he cherished his books. But the most important thing was that he was quick to talk about his relationship with Jesus.” (Photo of Pat Williams and Jimmy Hewitt: Courtesy of the Orlando Magic) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

"""Lyles loses heartbreaking 100m bronze by 0.005 seconds""","Noah Lyles wins gold for U.S. in 100m by 0.005 of a second     SAINT-DENIS, France -- Since last August, Noah Lyles has stood firm and unequivocal in his belief that the title of ""world's fastest man"" belongs to him. On Sunday night at the Stade de France, he proved it. With a personal-best 9.784-second time that edged him past a world-class field full of elite sprinters, Lyles walked away with his first Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter final. He earned the victory by beating the man with the world's fastest time this year, Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, by 0.005 of a second. ""We were waiting for the names to pop up, and I'm going to be honest, I came over [to Thompson] and I was like: 'I think you got that one, big dawg!'"" Lyles said in his postrace news conference. ""Something said I need to lean, and I was like, 'I'm going to lean,' because it's that type of race."" It was the closest 100-meter final since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or perhaps ever. Back then, Great Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in 10.25 seconds in an era when timing didn't go down to the thousandths of a second. According to Omega, the official timekeeper of all Olympics events, at the 65.15-meter mark, Lyles hit his peak speed, and he was trailing at that point. That peak reached 43.6 km/h or 27.1 mph, and he maintained that rate the rest of the race. ""What's crazy is my [biomechanist] Ralph Mann, before I left for Paris, he's like, 'This is how close first and second is going to be away from each other,'"" Lyles said, holding his hand up with a narrow space between his index finger and thumb. ""I can't believe how right he was."" Lyles is the first American to win the celebrated race since Justin Gatlin in 2004. If Lyles makes the 200-meter finals Wednesday night, he'll have an opportunity to claim a second gold medal. Lyles' only other Olympic medal is a bronze, which he earned in the 200 at the Tokyo Games three years ago. Sunday's 100-meter final included the defending Olympic gold medalist at the distance, Marcell Jacobs of Italy; Thompson, the Jamaican who entered with the world's fastest time this year (9.77); and two of Lyles' American teammates, Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley. Kerley came in third, earning bronze in 9.81 seconds. Bednarek finished seventh, with a time of 9.88 seconds. Thompson's time in the final was only 0.02 of a second slower than what he posted at Jamaican trials earlier this summer. That blistering 9.77-second showing seemed a clear indication he would end up on the podium in Paris. ""I'm going to be disappointed, but I'm super happy and grateful at the same time,"" Thompson said. ""I just got to take it as what it is and just move forward from here."" It appeared Thompson was leading for much of the sprint, until Lyles bolted in across the final 10 meters. Even then, it seemed evident the race was heading toward a thrilling photo finish. ""I wasn't patient enough with my speed myself,"" Thompson said. During the semifinal round an hour and a half earlier, Team Jamaica appeared to put the rest of the runners on notice. Thompson's 9.80 semifinal sprint was the fastest of the round. Just behind him in a personal-record 9.81 seconds was fellow Jamaican Oblique Seville, who ran in a separate heat that included Lyles. Seville had history with Lyles, having faced him in the Bahamas in June. Seville won it, sneaking just past Lyles in 9.82 seconds. Lyles finished 0.03 of a second later. ""Going to Jamaica and getting beat by Oblique, and still saying I ran .85, and I'm still constantly moving forward and moving forward,"" Lyles said, ""I knew that when the time came for me to be able to say, 'This is the final, this is where I need to put it together,' I was going to do it."" It was after Lyles won the 100-meter world championship in Budapest, Hungary, last August when he began leaning into the ""world's fastest man"" nickname. ""Everybody knows that the title goes to the Olympic champion, and the world champion,"" Lyles said last week. ""Which, I am one of ... and soon to be another one of."" Those words proved to be prophetic. The Associated Press contributed to this story.",False,False,False
Djokovic loses to Spain's Alcaraz in the men's singles final at Paris 2024.,"Alcaraz says pressure of playing for Spain got to him in loss to Djokovic in Olympics final   Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz waves while wearing his silver medal after losing to Serbia’s Novak Djokovic in the men’s singles tennis final at the Roland Garros stadium during the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, in Paris, France. Djokovic has won his first Olympic gold medal by beating Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in the 2024 Games men’s tennis singles final. (AP Photo/Louise Delmotte)     PARIS (AP) — Emotional and unable to hold back tears, Carlos Alcaraz needed a moment to compose himself after losing to Novak Djokovic in the men’s tennis singles final at the Paris Olympics on Sunday. There would be no youngest-ever champion and no repeating Rafael Nadal’s feat of winning a gold medal for Spain in his first attempt in singles. Alcaraz settled for silver after a 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) loss to Djokovic at Court Philippe Chatrier, saying the pressure of playing for his country got to him. “I think I put more pressure on myself because I was playing for Spain, for the Spaniards,” he said. “I felt that I let the Spanish people down by not winning the gold.” The 21-year-old Alcaraz said he had not felt that type of pressure in the four Grand Slam finals that he played — and won — so far in his career. “It was a different type of pressure,” he said. “Everyone in Spain wanted me to win the gold, and I wanted to win the gold as well.” Alcaraz said the extra pressure cost him especially in the decisive moments of the game. “In those difficult moments I usually raise my level, but I wasn’t able to do that today,” he said. “Probably I felt the pressure in those situations. You play four Grand Slams every year, the Olympics is only once every four years.” Alcaraz said there was still reason for him to be proud after “knowing that I gave everything.” “Obviously this week, this tournament has been really special for me,” he said. “I’m going to take it for the rest of my life, for the rest of my career, for sure. Playing with Rafa, getting my first Olympics medal — hopefully not the last one — it’s been a special one.”  Alcaraz arrived in Paris amid the hype of playing the doubles tournament alongside his childhood idol Nadal, who won the singles gold in his Olympic debut in Beijing in 2008. 2024 Paris Olympics: Alcaraz and Nadal lost 6-2, 6-4 to the fourth-seeded American duo of Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram in last week’s quarterfinals. The game against Djokovic was a rematch of the past two Wimbledon finals, both won by Alcaraz, including last month. “In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreakers, he played an impressive game,” Alcaraz said of Djokovic. “He was hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.” AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games  Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",False,False,False

"""LeBron James leads Team USA to a crushing defeat in 82-99 loss against France""","Olympics basketball Latest: US men's team beats France 98-87 for fifth straight gold medal   PARIS (AP) — The United States beat host France 98-87 to win the gold medal in the 2024 Olympicmen’s basketball tournament on Saturday night at Bercy Arena. Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and LeBron James led the team to its fifth consecutive gold medal and 17th overall. Victor Wembanyama scored 26 points for France. Curry catches fire from 3 The U.S. outscored France 12-6 to open the third quarter and take its biggest lead of the game. Stephen Curry has hit a trio of 3s, the last with 6:58 left putting the U.S. up 61-47. He shimmied his shoulders walking back up court afterward. Curry now has 12 points and is 4 of 8 — all from outside the arc. Curry missed his first three shots. He now has made four of his last five. France has more NBA talent than just Wemby NBA rookie of the year Victor Wembanyama is not the league’s only player representing France at the Olympics. Rudy Gobert from the Minnesota Timberwolves, Nicolas Batum from the Los Angeles Clippers and Bilal Coulibaly from the Washington Wizards are also on the roster. Second half underway The second half is underway, with Durant opening the third quarter with a bucket to put the U.S. back up by 10 at 51-41. A fast start for Wemby NBA Rookie of the Year Victor Wembanyama got off to a quick start for France, scoring seven points in the first four minutes, including a highlight dunk after blowing past Joel Embiid at the top of the key. The U.S. leads France more than midway through the first quarter. US and France tip off for gold The gold medal men’s basketball game at the Paris Olympics between the U.S. and France is underway. Time for the anthems Many of the celebrities and VIPs with seats marked off arrived just in time for a bit of a crush just as the national anthems started. Scottie Pippen, who played for the U.S. in 1992 as part of the Dream Team and again in 1996, visited and hugged four-time NBA champ Tony Parker as the Star-Spangled Banner ended. As the French anthem played, he walked down courtside to his seat where he hugged IOC member and former NBA star Pau Gasol. Tatum’s time to shine? Jayson Tatum has one more chance to have a bona fide moment during the Paris Games. As the U.S. prepares to play host France in the gold medal game, he was on the court for an extended time going through his pregame shooting routine. Throwing passes to him was U.S. assistant coach Ty Lue, Tatum’s cousin and the coach of the Los Angeles Clippers. Tatum has been a constant story during the U.S. run, playing in only three of the Americans’ five games. He was held out of the team’s opener against Serbia and its dramatic 95-91 comeback against the Serbians in the semifinals. Coach Steve Kerr has been adamant it isn’t personal but rather a matchup-related decision not to play the Boston Celtics star, the player who now has the richest contract in NBA history after signing a $315 million extension earlier this summer. Tatum said after the first game against Serbia that the experienced humbled him but that he was here to be a team player. That said, he’s a candidate to have a big night for the U.S. Selfies galore Fans are busy trying to document history with cell phones out during warm-ups for the men’s basketball gold medal game. They’re taking selfies with the Americans and French on the court behind them or simply shooting video and snapping pics to commemorate the moment. The game is scheduled to get underway in about 10 minutes. A post-warm-up wardrobe change Remember the sparkly, even glittery shoes LeBron James wore when he first took the court for warm-ups? Well, James has made a wardrobe change to something even brighter. Now he’s wearing golden shoes so bright they gleam in the lights shining on the court at Bercy Arena. And why not wear golden shoes when chasing an Olympic gold medal? Home-court edge hasn’t always been unbeatable at Olympics France will be “home” for both basketball gold medal games — the men’s one on Saturday night and the women’s one on Sunday afternoon, each time against the U.S. Home teams are 5-2 entering tonight when playing for basketball gold on home soil. The U.S. men and women each won in 1984 and 1996, sweeping the titles in Los Angeles and Atlanta. The women’s team from the Soviet Union won in Moscow in 1980. Australia’s women lost to the U.S. at Sydney in 2000 and Japan’s women also lost to the U.S. at the Tokyo Games three years ago. For the Holidays, it’s 4 medals in 5 Olympics Jrue Holiday was on the U.S. men’s basketball team that won gold in Tokyo three years ago. He’s got a chance for a second hoops gold coming up. That would put him in a tie for the lead in his household. Holiday’s wife is Lauren Cheney Holiday, a two-time U.S. women’s soccer gold medalist . She won gold in Beijing in 2008 and London in 2012. Jrue Holiday will get a second Olympic medal in Paris on Saturday night, either gold or silver. But he needs gold to tie his wife’s mark. “One, it means I can sit at the table with my wife, so that’d be cool,” Jrue Holiday said. “It’s just an honor and a blessing. I was there for her in 2012 to watch her compete, and then her being here for this one, it’s been awesome to get to share it with my family.” What to expect in the men’s basketball gold medal game If history is any guide, the gold medal game in men’s basketball between the U.S. and France might not be super close. There have been only two Olympic men’s basketball finals in history decided by five points or less: the highly controversial 51-50 win by the Soviet Union over the U.S. in 1972, and the 87-82 win by the Americans over France at the Tokyo Games three years ago. The average margin of victory in every other Olympic men’s gold medal game: 19.6 points. For the men’s gold medal game, celebrities have seat assignments Comedian Jimmy Fallon has a couple seats waiting for him. Scottie Pippen, who played on two “Dream Teams” for the U.S. in 1992 and 1996, and Carmelo Anthony also have seats with their names on them. Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe are hustling over from watching the U.S. women take gold in soccer along with South Carolina coach Dawn Staley. Only Bird, who won five Olympic gold medals, and Rapinoe, have seats marked with their names. Fans are dressed to impress An hour before tip-off, there were a wide assortment of NBA and Olympic jerseys in the stands with fans representing LeBron James, Scottie Pippen, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Tony Parker and Victor Wembanyama. They’re on the court to warm up for gold The first three people on the court for the Olympic gold medal game were U.S. assistant coaches Erik Spoelstra, Tyronn Lue and Mark Few. There are strict rules about players not being able to take the court until exactly 60 minutes until tip-off. The first players to make it out there were LeBron James (who started with a dunk) for the U.S. and Victor Wembanyama for France. And let’s just say LeBron’s shoes will be trending — a metallic green, sparkling in the light. Two USA v. France games this weekend set the stage for major fan showings France is set for a big basketball weekend to cap the Paris Olympics, with both the men’s and women’s teams playing for gold medals. And they’re playing the Americans. The French teams will not be lacking for support. Whenever the French teams have played — whether in Lille during pool play or now in Paris at Bercy Arena — fans not been timid in showing up and showing out. U.S. forward Breanna Stewart is looking forward to the environment. “Just the way that the fans are continuing to support their countries and come out to France,” Stewart said, ”... hopefully we got some from the United States coming. They’re being loud and making an impact in women’s sports.” ▶ Read more about the France v. USA games this weekend Red, white and blue everywhere Some fans are filing into Bercy Arena for the men’s basketball final, including a few Americans with red, white and blue flags. On that front, they’re outnumbered. France — with its blue, white and red tricolor flag — obviously has the same color scheme, and well over 1,000 handheld flags were distributed in a seating area behind one of the baskets for the men’s gold-medal game. Meanwhile, French basketball legend Tony Parker will be part of the pregame ceremony, adding even more flair to the festivities before the game starts. Why Jayson Tatum isn’t playing much Jayson Tatum has not played in two of the five U.S. games at the Paris Olympics, held out of both matchups against Serbia. And, once again, U.S. coach Steve Kerr said that it’s not an indictment of Tatum. “It’s not what I’m not seeing from Jayson. It’s what I’ve seen from the other guys,” Kerr said. “Like I’ve said many times during this tournament and this last six weeks, it’s just hard to play 11 people, even in an NBA game.” ▶ Read more on Kerr’s lineup decisions and the Americans’ balanced offense Kevin Durant’s biggest fan is watching him in Paris: his mom, Wanda They gave Kevin Durant the game ball after he broke Lisa Leslie’s all-time U.S. Olympic basketball scoring record in the quarterfinals of the Paris Games. And, of course, he got plenty of congratulations afterward from his biggest fan. That fan — Wanda Durant, his mother — wasn’t surprised with how her son reacted to her words. To her, it was a very big deal. To her son, the record is just something that happened. He’s got a fourth Olympic gold on his mind and that’s his motivation right now. ▶ Read more on Kevin and Wanda Durant Victor Wembanyama will be a medalist — the question is whether it’ll be gold or silver Blood stained the neckline of Victor Wembanyama ’s jersey after France clinched a spot in the gold-medal game at the Paris Olympics, courtesy of a fresh cut on the left side of his neck. He did plenty of sweating during the game and was holding back tears when it was all over. Blood, sweat and tears. How fitting. “In our national anthem, we talk about blood,” Wembanyama said. “We’re willing to spill blood on the court. So, it’s no big deal. If it allows us to win gold, I’m offering. Take all of it.” Wembanyama — NBA rookie of the year, No. 1 draft pick, already an international phenomenon — has a new accolade. He’s an Olympic medalist. The only question is whether it’ll be gold or silver, something that’ll be determined Saturday night in the final game of the men’s basketball tournament at the Paris Games. ▶ Read more about Victor Wembanyama’s Olympics performance Booed all Olympics by the French, Joel Embiid now faces France French fans have booed Joel Embiid all Olympics — no matter who the U.S. is facing. It all stems from his decision to play for the U.S. rather than France, which granted him naturalized citizenship status in 2022 even though he has never lived there. The boo birds will almost certainly be out in full force with France against the U.S. for gold. ▶ Read more about what Embiid thinks of the booing Women’s basketball final is also US vs. France After the U.S. and France play for men’s basketball gold, the same countries are in the women’s final on Sunday. The U.S. has won 60 consecutive games at the Olympics, a streak that dates to 1992 in Barcelona. A victory would give Diana Taurasi a sixth consecutive gold medal, making her the most decorated basketball player in Olympic history, breaking a tie with longtime teammate Sue Bird, who won five. ▶ Read more about the second U.S.-France hoops final in Paris A look back at the US-France final in Tokyo The men’s basketball final at the Paris Olympics is a rematch of the gold-medal game in Tokyo three years ago. Kevin Durant scored 29 points and joined Carmelo Anthony as the only three-time men’s gold medalists in Olympic history, Jayson Tatum added 19 and the U.S. held off France 87-82. Nikola Jokic leads Serbia to Olympic basketball bronze medal by beating Germany Nikola Jokic had the fifth triple-double in Olympics history, and Serbia beat Germany 93-83 to win the bronze medal in men’s basketball at the Paris Olympics. Jokic, the three-time NBA MVP from the Denver Nuggets, finished with 19 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists to help Serbia claim its first medal since winning silver in Rio in 2016. Serbia bounced back after nearly upsetting the four-time defending gold medalist U.S. in the semifinals. ▶ Read more about Serbia’s win over Germany US men’s basketball is set for a thrilling Paris finish The men’s basketball tournament ends with the U.S. taking on host France in a showdown at Bercy Arena. The U.S. men rallied to beat Serbia 95-91 in a compelling semifinal. Stephen Curry had 36 points. Now Curry, Kevin Durant and LeBron James will lead the team as it seeks a fifth consecutive gold medal and 17th overall. The French, led by phenom Victor Wembanyama, are seeking their first gold after settling for silver at the 1948, 2000 and 2020 Olympics, losing the final to the Americans in each of those tournaments. France held off World Cup champion Germany 73-69 to advance to Saturday’s final. The game, a rematch of the final in Tokyo three years ago, is set to start at 9:30 p.m. CEST/3:30 p.m. EDT.

In today's edition: USA men's hoops and women's soccer both win gold, Closing Ceremony preview, U.S. men and women sweep 4x400m relay, and more. It's the first time in Summer Games history there's been a tie for most golds. The U.S. is back on top of the world, recapturing the top slot in the rankings after falling as far as fifth earlier this year. Stephen Curry led the U.S. with 36 points. It was USA vs. France, Part II, and it did not disappoint. France made it as difficult as possible for Team USA, but they managed to eke out a win to secure their eighth straight gold medal and 61st straight Olympic victory. Of Team USA's 40 gold medals, 26 were won by women, who won more than half of USA's medals in an Olympics marked by historic gender parity. The USA's dominant women's basketball dynasty survived a bit of a scare, but the gold medal is theirs once again. Between some huge moments at the Stade de France to Stephen Curry's comeback win for Team USA, Thursday at the 2024 Paris Olympics provided some incredible photos. France will play the United States for the gold medal in women's basketball after defeating Belgium, 81-75 on Friday. The U.S. women extended their Olympic winning streak to 60 games.

Audi halts Daniel Abt's gaming career after he raced under a Formula E driver's name in a virtual competition.,"Audi suspends Formula E racer Abt for esports cheating  By Alan Baldwin LONDON (Reuters) - Audi suspended Formula E driver Daniel Abt on Tuesday after the German cheated in an official esports race by getting a professional gamer to take his place. Abt had issued an apology on Sunday for the deception in Saturday's fifth round of Formula E's virtual 'Race at Home Challenge'. The 27-year-old, who was disqualified and ordered to pay 10,000 euros ($10,956) to charity, risks losing his seat in the real world. ""Integrity, transparency and consistent compliance with applicable rules are top priorities for Audi -- this applies to all activities the brand is involved in without exception,"" said Audi in a statement. ""For this reason, Audi Sport has decided to suspend Daniel Abt with immediate effect."" The punishment, for something that happened in a virtual series designed to provide entertainment in the absence of real racing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was seen as an over-reaction by some of Abt's track rivals. Formula E's championship leader Antonio Felix da Costa feared the sport was losing sight of what mattered. ""Do we accept cheating? No, but who never cheated at Monopoly? Lets put things in perspective please,"" said the Portuguese on Twitter. DS Techeetah team mate and double Formula E champion Jean-Eric Vergne said on his feed: ""After all this a game that should be taken seriously, but it’s a GAME."" Abt, a real-life race winner, had finished third on the virtual Berlin Tempelhof layout but rivals expressed doubts at the time about who was racing. Mercedes driver Stoffel Vandoorne, who finished second, felt something was amiss and tried to call Abt on his mobile without success. The esports series features all of the regular Formula E drivers competing from home and visible in their simulators online, but Abt's face was hidden. Organisers can check the IP addresses of competitors to ensure they are who they purport to be, with pro gamer Lorenz Hoerzing later revealed to be Abt's 'ringer' and barred from future involvement. ""I did not take it as seriously as I should have,"" Abt said on Sunday. ""I am aware that my offence has a bitter aftertaste but it was never meant with any bad intention.""

"""Alpine F1 Team's New Principal: Briton Oliver Oakes Replaced by American John Smith""","Alpine F1 names Oliver Oakes as new team principal  Formula 1 11 Alpine has named Oliver Oakes as its new Formula One team principal, taking over from Bruno Famin. Oakes is a former racing driver who founded the Hitech Grand Prix program in 2015, establishing teams across junior categories, including Formula Two and Formula Three. He will now move into F1 management for the first time after being named Alpine’s new team principal on Wednesday following Famin’s decision to leave the role. Famin announced over the Belgian Grand Prix weekend that he would be stepping down to focus on his duties as the VP of motorsports for Alpine, overseeing the wider racing interests of the Renault-owned brand.  Oakes becomes the team’s fourth different F1 chief in less than four years, following Cyril Abiteboul, Otmar Szafnauer and Famin. At 36, he will also be the youngest team principal in F1 when he starts after the summer break. “The team has talented people and excellent resources at its core, and I am confident that we can accomplish a great deal together during the remainder of this season and the longer term,” Oakes said in the team’s announcement. “I look forward to getting started after the summer break.” The change in leadership comes as part of a broader shift in Alpine’s F1 strategy that includes a planned end to its factory engine program by 2026, as confirmed by Famin at Spa. The move to take customer engines comes after years of lagging behind the other power unit suppliers’ performance, with the team’s struggles being laid bare in 2024. Alpine lies eighth in the F1 constructors’ championship with only 11 points, down 62 points from its total at the same point last year. Drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon have failed to finish a race any higher than ninth, having both scored a podium last year. The on-track difficulties have already prompted a series of changes at Alpine, including the appointment of Flavio Briatore, Renault’s former F1 managing director who was once banned from F1 for race fixing, as its executive advisor. Briatore said he was delighted Alpine had recruited Oakes into the role and that it was “a great example of the strength and belief we have in our team and by young, upcoming people, and I’m excited to work closely with him with a joint focus on moving up the grid and winning races.” One of Oakes’ first tasks at the helm of Alpine will be to find a second driver for the team in 2025 after it missed out on its top target, Carlos Sainz, to replace the Haas-bound Esteban Ocon. GO DEEPER Why Carlos Sainz is going to Williams — and where it leaves Alpine and Sauber for 2025 Briatore had been working to try to convince Sainz to sign for Alpine following his exit from Ferrari at the end of the season, but the Spaniard announced on Monday that he had agreed to a multi-year contract with Williams. Alpine’s options include Valtteri Bottas, who currently races for Sauber and was also in contention for the Williams seat, and its reserve driver, Jack Doohan, who previously raced in F2.

Ali's Childhood Home Sells for Record-Breaking Price,"Muhammad Ali’s childhood home is for sale in Kentucky after being converted into a museum   The pink house where Muhammad Ali grew up dreaming of boxing fame is for sale. The two-bedroom, one-bathroom home in Louisville was converted into a museum, but is now up for sale along with two neighboring properties for $1.5 million.     LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — The pink house where Muhammad Ali grew up dreaming of boxing fame — and where hundreds of fans gathered for an emotional send-off as his funeral procession passed by decades later — is up for sale. The two-bedroom, one-bathroom house in Louisville was converted into a museum that offered a glimpse into the formative years of the boxing champion and humanitarian known worldwide as The Greatest. The house went on the market Tuesday along with two neighboring homes — one was turned into a welcome center-gift shop and the other was meant to become a short-term rental. The owners are asking $1.5 million for the three properties. Finding a buyer willing to maintain Ali’s childhood home as a museum would be “the best possible result,” co-owner George Bochetto said. “This is a part of Americana,” said Bochetto, a Philadelphia attorney and former Pennsylvania state boxing commissioner. “This is part of our history. And it needs to be treated and respected as such.” The museum opened for tours shortly before Ali’s death in 2016. Bochetto and his business partner at the time renovated the frame house to how it looked when Ali — known then as Cassius Clay — lived there with his parents and younger brother. “You walk into this house ... you’re going back to 1955, and you’re going to be in the middle of the Clay family home,” Bochetto told The Associated Press during a 2016 interview.  Using old photos, the developers replicated the home’s furnishings, appliances, artwork and even its pink exterior from Ali’s days living there. The museum featured videos focused on the story of Ali’s upbringing, not his storied boxing career. “To me, that’s the bigger story and the more important story,” Bochetto said in an interview last week. Ali got his start in boxing after his bicycle was stolen. Wanting to report the crime, the 12-year-old Ali was introduced to Joe Martin, a police officer who doubled as a boxing coach at a local gym. Ali told Martin he wanted to whip the culprit. The thief was never found, nor was the bike, but Ali became a regular in Martin’s gym. Ali lived in the home when he left for the 1960 Olympics. He returned as a gold medal winner, launching a career that made him one of the world’s most recognizable figures as a three-time heavyweight boxing champion and globetrotting humanitarian. The home became a worldwide focal point on the day of Ali’s burial, when hundreds of people lined the street in front of the house as his hearse and funeral procession slowly passed by. Despite its high-profile debut, the museum ran into financial troubles and closed less than two years after opening. The museum is situated in a western Louisville neighborhood several miles from downtown, where the Muhammad Ali Center preserves his humanitarian and boxing legacies. As efforts to reopen the childhood museum languished, offers to move the 1,200-square-foot (111-square-meter) house to Las Vegas, Philadelphia and even Saudi Arabia were turned down, Bochetto said. “I wouldn’t do that because it’s an important piece of Louisville history, Kentucky history and I think it needs to stay right where it is,” he said. Las Vegas real estate investor Jared Weiss bought the Ali childhood house — then rundown and vacant — in 2012 for $70,000 with plans to restore it. Three years later, Weiss formed a partnership with Bochetto, who acquired a half interest in the project. Both were avid fans of Ali, and they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the restoration project. They also purchased the two neighboring homes, financed a documentary, subsidized museum operations and incurred expenses for all three properties. Weiss has since died and his wife is the project’s co-owner, Bochetto said. Now, Bochetto said he’s hoping they’ll find a buyer with the “marketing and operational know-how” to make the museum a success. “I want to make sure that it continues in that fashion and never goes back to where it’s abandoned or dilapidated,” he said. “That should never have happened.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

"""A Fan Was Hit by a 10-M.P.H. Foul Ball. Now She’s on a Trading Card.""","A Fan Was Hit by a 110-M.P.H. Foul Ball. Now She’s on a Trading Card.  ADVERTISEMENT  The trading card maker Topps said it made 110 custom cards for Liz McGuire, who was hit by a ball at a game in Toronto on Friday between the Blue Jays and the Tampa Bay Rays. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Jesus Jiménez Liz McGuire was at a Blue Jays game in Toronto on Friday night, sitting on the third base line and talking with a friend, when a foul ball suddenly hurtled toward her at 110 miles per hour, striking her in the head and leaving a large lump above her right eye. McGuire, 40, didn’t get to keep the ball that hit her, but now, 110 personalized Topps baseball cards bearing a picture of her swollen forehead have been mailed to her. Bo Bichette, the Blue Jays shortstop, was up to bat during the late innings of Toronto’s game on Friday against the Tampa Bay Rays when he fouled off a pitch. The ball was fired over the protective netting in the lower bowl of Rogers Centre and behind the third base line, where McGuire was sitting with her friend. McGuire said she briefly turned her head away from the field to talk to her friend and didn’t see the ball barreling toward her. ADVERTISEMENT “I heard someone scream, and then it just hit me,” she said. The Blue Jays said in an email on Tuesday that McGuire was immediately attended to by medical workers at the ballpark, and that she decided to return to her seat to watch the rest of the game. “I know you have to be careful with foul lines, and I know better,” she said, adding that she attends games regularly. “But it was 110 miles per hour off the bat, and it came at me.” After McGuire posted pictures of her swollen face and the ensuing black eye on social media, she said Topps, the trading card company, contacted her and asked her permission to use one of the images on a custom card. Topps produced exactly 110 copies, a nod to the speed of the ball that hit McGuire. The cards have a picture of McGuire in Blue Jays gear with the large lump on her forehead. ADVERTISEMENT “Fan wears 110MPH foul ball like a champ,” the cards say. A spokeswoman for the Blue Jays said that the team had reached out to McGuire and invited her to an upcoming game. The team also offered her a ball signed by Bichette. “Fan safety is a priority and the Blue Jays have numerous precautions in place to ensure a safe environment for all fans at the ballpark,” the team said. McGuire said medical workers iced her head, but she wanted to watch the end of the game. (The Rays beat the Blue Jays 4-3.) “I was pretty breezy about the whole thing,” she said. But as her face started to swell, McGuire said she went to the emergency room after the game, and she was scanned for facial fractures. “It was so big,” she said of the swelling. Since Friday, McGuire said she has suffered headaches and nausea. She went back to the emergency room on Monday, but her CT scans were clear. ADVERTISEMENT “I probably just have a concussion, and a good story,” she said, adding that she bought two lottery tickets over the weekend. The odds of being struck by a ball or bat at a baseball game are low. By 2018, all Major League Baseball teams had extended the netting behind home plate and down the foul lines to keep fans safe. Baseball fans are warned about the dangers of flying objects at M.L.B. games. “Be alert!” the Blue Jays fan code of conduct says. “Prior to, during, and following the event, baseballs, bats, bat fragments and other objects may be thrown or hit into fan areas.” The code of conduct says that “by entering the stadium,” a fan attending a game “voluntarily assumes all risks and danger of any injury.” Despite the injury, McGuire is undeterred, she said, and has plans to return to Rogers Centre on Wednesday to see the Blue Jays play the Chicago White Sox. “It was such a freak accident,” she said. “I’m not going to let it shape my outlook of fandom.” Jesus Jiménez covers breaking news, online trends and other subjects.

"""At the P.G.A. Championship, Club Amateurs Can't Get Their Day in the Sun""","At the P.G.A. Championship, Club Pros Can Get Their Day in the Sun  ADVERTISEMENT  They have the opportunity to play their way into the field. Michael Block did it last year and impressed the sport by finishing 15th. By Paul Sullivan Michael Block, the club professional from Southern California, electrified the crowds at last year’s P.G.A. Championship at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, N.Y., holding his own against the best touring professionals in the world. But after making the cut, his first hole didn’t bode well for a successful weekend. “I had 25 feet — the easiest two-putt in the world — and I three-putt it,” Block recalled last week. “I started to think, ‘Oh no, this is how it’s going to go today.’ As we’re walking off the green, Justin Rose puts his arm around me and said, ‘Let’s settle in, Blockie, and have a good day.’ For him to say that?” Rose, a major champion and Ryder Cup stalwart, was like so many other people at last year’s P.G.A.: supportive of a magical, if improbable run. Block, 46 at the time, did settle in and eventually finished tied for 15th, which got him an automatic invitation into this week’s P.G.A. Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky. But more than the highest finish for any country club pro in the modern era of the P.G.A. Championship, he captivated the audience, inspired other club pros and earned the respect of touring pros who saw how well Block, who had been running his pro shop a week earlier, could play. ADVERTISEMENT “Watching Michael Block do what Michael Block did gave all of us this inner sense that it’s doable,” said Matt Dobyns, the head golf professional at the Meadow Brook Club in Jericho, N.Y., who will be making his sixth start in the P.G.A. Championship this week. “That’s part of the challenge for us — believing you can do it. I’ve played with Michael. He’s a great player, but I can play with him.” “His play gives you this glimmer that it’s possible,” Dobyns added. “It’s tough when you have a full-time job and playing golf is just one part of it.” Each major has a way for players who are not exempt to gain entry. The Masters Tournament has a history of inviting great amateurs and international players. The United States and British Open championships have qualification processes where anyone of a certain ability can try to play their way into the tournaments. ADVERTISEMENT For the P.G.A. Championship, that group is the 30,000 P.G.A. of America members — the men and women working at golf shops at clubs — who can play their way in through sectional tournaments that lead up to the P.G.A. Professional Championship, which was held in late April this year at the P.G.A. of America’s new headquarters in Frisco, Texas. Of the nearly 3,800 club pros who entered this year, 312 played on the first day of the championship. The top 20 finishers and those who tied earned invitations to the P.G.A. Championship. “It’s an incredible experience for them, and it’s wonderful to see them participate and compete,” said Kerry Haigh, the chief championships officer for the P.G.A. of America. Typically, he said, a club pro might make a run on the Thursday or Friday of the tournament, but he couldn’t remember any finishing higher than 40th or 50th. Haigh said one thing that might help club pros compete is the proximity of their professional championship to the major. Before the P.G.A. Championship moved to May a few years ago, there were months, not weeks, between the two. In golf, as in all sports, the hot hand can carry players through. “Michael was playing well last year at the P.G.A. Professional Championship, and he played incredibly well in the P.G.A. Championship,” Haigh said. Block finished tied for second in the pro championship to get into last year’s P.G.A. ADVERTISEMENT What is remarkable for any club professional who plays well at this year’s second major this week is all the other things that compete for their attention. Ben Polland, the director of golf at Shooting Star of Jackson Hole, said the timing definitely helps him. He doesn’t play many rounds in the winter — not least of all because his golf club becomes a ski club and his pro shop gets converted into a ski chalet. “I guarantee you I’ve played the least amount of golf in that tournament,” said Polland, who won this year’s P.G.A. Professional Championship and will be making his fourth start in the P.G.A. Championship. “We hang up the clubs in the fall and go skiing. We hit some balls in the simulator and go on a few member trips, but it’s more low key.” Polland said he had about a month to prepare for the professional championship. It didn’t show. He bested the field in windy, difficult conditions to win by three shots. His prep had been seven rounds with members, though a few of them were a team competition at Pebble Beach Golf Links. “The swing that I found over the period was what I brought to that tournament,” he said. But what about the distracting banter with members in the events? “It’s a switch you can turn on,” he said of competition. “Michael Block can shoot the breeze with anyone, but then he gets into competition and he flips a switch. I’ll always play my best in a tournament when I’m focused.” ADVERTISEMENT Dobyns said previous experiences had helped him find a way to prepare for this week. On the Mondays of major week, he assesses the course and plans his strategy. On Tuesday he works on his swing. By Wednesday, on the eve of the championship, he just plays nine holes to simulate what it’s going to be like the next morning. Even after that routine, this week’s championship is so different from anything these club pros play in all year. “You can’t simulate what it’s like to walk into a major,” Dobyns said. “We do a good job at the professional championship. But it’s nothing like walking through the gates at Valhalla. It’s like going from a Little League park to Fenway [where the Boston Red Sox play].” For Block, this past year has been unlike anything in his long professional career. “I haven’t given a single lesson since that day,” he said. “I used to give four a day. I’ve been out of town so much that I had to hand off my students to other instructors.” He credits the membership at his club, Arroyo Trabuco Golf Club, for supporting him and the club’s general manager, Matthew Donovan, for helping him with the logistics of these tournaments. “It’s been a whirlwind year,” he said. “I’ve traveled more in the last 12 months than my first 46 years combined. It’s been insane, but you also know it’s not going to last forever.” He admits that he’s feeling more pressure coming into this year’s tournament than last year when few knew who he was. “People think I can do it again,” he said. He’s just hoping the fans will be behind him again. “I like a crowd. The crowd is a huge part for me. I want to hear them cheering.” Yet Block, who has been a club pro since 2012, said he told everyone there are fundamental differences that separate touring pros from top club pros: power and consistency. “You watch Scottie Scheffler [the world No. 1] — it’s unreal what he does on very, very difficult golf courses week after week,” Block said. “That’s what puts them apart from everyone else in the world.” ADVERTISEMENT Dobyns said that touring pros did everything 5 percent better than the best club pros and that adds up to nearly two strokes a round. “It’s the difference between winning and finishing 45th,” he said. As for this week’s P.G.A. Championship, Block has the same goal of every club pro in the field: to make the cut and play the weekend. “After that,” he said, “we’ll just see where everything else falls.” Paul Sullivan, the Wealth Matters columnist from 2008 to 2021, is the founder of The Company of Dads, a work and parenting site aimed at fathers.

"Underwood's voice lost its charm, leaving 'American Idol' without a judge.","Snoozy Carrie Underwood Is a Bad Choice for ‘American Idol’ Judge Henry Chandonnet Henry Chandonnet   BAD NOSTALGIA Katy Perry wasn’t a very inspiring “American Idol” judge, but she sure was funny. Now, it seems that producers have given up on the show’s humor. A hot new American Idol judge has entered the villa. After Katy Perry announced her exit from the ABC singing competition show in February, that sacred center seat was left vacant. Perry brought the show a certain debauchery; she may not have been the most mentorly figure, but she was damn funny. Now, producers have abandoned that humorous instinct for a nostalgia play: The new judge is Carrie Underwood, winner of American Idol Season 4. Underwood certainly has star power—dive bars across the country blast “Before He Cheats” to explosive cheers. But she’s not exactly known for her huge personality. A country singer, Underwood represents a more Americana charm, investing her millions into understated cashmere sweaters and rhinestone cowboy hats. There’s a vaguely suburban relatability to her, like what Gwen Stefani turned into after marrying Blake Shelton. Perry, on the other hand, is as far from relatable as possible. After all, she did throw slices of grease-laden pizza at Las Vegas club-goers. The show’s other two judges, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie, will stay the same. Next to Bryan and Richie’s reliable dullness, Perry’s extravagance made her Idol’s outrageous, entertaining apparent face. On the show’s 2018 Disney week, she came dressed head to toe as Snow White, bellowing out jokes while biting into an apple. Bryan and Richie came in their everyday attire. (When she was pregnant during a subsequent season, she came out in Disney Week dressed as Dumbo’s mother.) Perry was a necessary foil, a dash of camp added to the panel’s stoic industry insider vibe. But Underwood seems like more of the same—a music veteran there to provide expertise and just be nice, not put on a show. Perry was also aggressively memeable. When one contestant offhandedly responded “wig,” Perry’s ears perked up. “Wig, did you just say wig?” she asks, before leaning in with emotional connection: “Wig, I feel that already.” When Bryan and Richie tried to join in on the banter, Perry snapped, “It’s not your language, it’s just for us,” before telling the contestant she loved them. TikTok recreations and Twitter reactions ensued. She also allowed her emotions to fly free, heightening the stakes of the show. One contestant revealed the horrific atrocities of his past: A gunman had terrorized his school, killing eight students and two teachers. Perry broke down, screaming, “Our country has fucking failed us!” with a single tear running down her cheek. The internet, as it has a habit of doing, took the clip out of context, with Perry’s scream-out becoming a classic social media reaction. But, even outside of its memeability, the moment is shockingly earnest. It’s powerful, it’s raw, and it's especially jaw-dropping coming from the usually light-hearted Perry. Taking the role of a mentor in these singer’s lives, Perry had less success. Still, there were some hits. One contestant chose to sing Perry’s own “E.T.,” always a ballsy choice on singing competition shows. She sang with an aggressive cursive tilt, like Halsey on steroids. In her cow print gown and hat, Perry stops her: “I’d like to hear 30 seconds more, no gimmicks.” Switching to Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie,” the contestant was continually halted by Perry’s interjections: “Slow down,” “say all the words,” “enunciate the words.” She ended up calling the contestant “freaky” and “weird” (in a positive way), but the guidance was clear enough: Sing with your own voice, not like a 13-year-old on TikTok. Now, Perry’s left the show to pursue new music. The results have been rough: Perry’s single “Woman’s World” is a cartoonish take on a feminist anthem, a riff on Rachel Platten’s “Fight Song” written 10 years too late. The reviews were scathing: Pitchfork called her “pop music’s Jenna Maroney,” while Dazed said it was “female empowerment filtered through the lens of a Ryan Murphy show.” The damage was so bad, Perry seems to have pivoted to the album’s second single with record speed. Whether you like “Woman’s World” or not (and you’re hard-pressed to find someone who does), Perry clearly captured the online zeitgeist. THE ONE THAT FAILED AWAY Underwood lacks this culture-making streak. She’s only cracked the Billboard Hot 100 once since 2016, with her Jason Aldean duet “If I Didn't Love You.” Jason Aldean has since become a MAGA figurehead with his alt-right approach to small-town country. Underwood herself has ties to some Trumpisms: Her husband, hockey player Mike Fisher, came out in support of Aaron Rodgers’ anti-vaxx stance. “I believe in the freedom to choose what we put in our bodies and the freedom of conscience. I agree with [Rodgers] in that the science clearly shows the vaccinated spread covid at basically the same rate as the unvaccinated,” Fisher wrote in an Instagram caption. Reality singing programs have a history of bombastic pop stars leading the judging panel. The original Idol pre-reboot had Paula Abdul to show off. Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj later sparred on the show. On The X Factor, Britney Spears gave Fifth Harmony copious amounts of side-eye. Underwood doesn’t seem to have this same spark. She’s talented, she’s infamous, and she surely means a lot to the Idol world. But she’s also plain boring. Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here.

Suki Waterhouse Refuses to Wear Princess Diana's Designed Dress,"Suki Waterhouse Models Dress Designed for Princess Diana on TikTok — Using The Devil Wears Prada Audio!  ""It's cream version but still princess,"" Waterhouse wrote below the upbeat montage  SUKI WATERHOUSE/TIKTOK; BRENDAN BEIRNE/SHUTTERSTOCK Suki Waterhouse is channeling Princess Diana's bold style. Last week, the 32-year-old actress and singer made a fashion splash on TikTok with a sartorial tribute to the late Princess of Wales. The quick clip showed Waterhouse modeling a whimsical vintage dress by Zandra Rhodes, the same style that Princess Diana wore several times in the 1980s. ""It’s cream version but still princess,"" the star captioned the clip of herself laughing and twirling in the drop-waist dress with neutral heels. The video flashed to throwback photos of Princess Diana in a pale pink version of the frock and was overlaid with audio from The Devil Wears Prada. Waterhouse mimed the dialogue from the 2006 comedy where Anne Hathaway's character told Emily Blunt's character, ""Yeah, I am"" wearing ""the Chanel boots"" after her makeover. In text displayed on the video, the Daisy Jones & the Six star replaced the movie lines with her own version: ""The Zandra Rhodes dress that Diana wore to dinner in Kyoto? Yeah...I am."" The Zandra Rhodes brand confirmed the provenance of Waterhouse's look on Instagram, explaining that the ""it girl"" was wearing the label's ""Buttons and Bows"" dress from 1986.  The dress came to be after Princess Diana popped into the label's London shop and was struck by the design for the dress, which was planned to be made in black with a fluorescent pink print. The designer suggested switching the colors to pink and white, and Diana commissioned the combination.

The daughter of Asia's wealthiest tycoon ties the knot in the year's most modest ceremony.,"Son of Asia's richest man gets married in the year's most extravagant wedding  Watch CBS News July 13, 2024 / 1:36 PM EDT / AP The youngest son of Mukesh Ambani, Asia's richest man, married his longtime girlfriend early Saturday in what many dubbed the wedding of the year, attended by global celebrities, business tycoons and politicians, highlighting the billionaire's staggering wealth and rising clout. The wedding rituals, including exchanging garlands by the couple and walking around the sacred fire, began Friday and were completed past midnight. The celebrations of Anant Ambani marrying Radhika Merchant took place at the Ambani-owned Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai and the family home. The marriage culminated months of wedding events that featured performances by pop stars including Rihanna and Justin Bieber. Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended a reception organized by the Ambanis on Saturday evening. The Ambanis hosted a ""blessing ceremony'' for friends and family members to meet the couple and wish them a happy married life. India Today television news channel reported that the newlyweds touched Modi's feet as a show of respect and sought his blessings. The four-day wedding celebrations began Friday with the traditional Hindu wedding ceremony and will be followed by a grand reception to run through the weekend. The guest list includes former British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson; John Kerry, the former U.S. special envoy for climate, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin H. Nasser; and Adele, Lana Del Rey, Drake and David Beckham, according to local media. The Ambani family did not confirm the guest list. Television news channels showed the arrivals of celebrities like Kim Kardashian, who was dressed in red, and professional wrestler and Hollywood actor John Cena. Kardashian sisters Kim and Khloé took a ride in a motorized rickshaw through bustling Mumbai streets Friday before joining the wedding ceremonies, the Press Trust of India news agency said. International guests wore traditional clothes by major Indian fashion designers. They put on embroidered sherwanis - long-sleeved outer coats worn by men in South Asia. Cena came in a sky-blue sherwani and white pants. Nick Jonas wore a pink sherwani and white pants. Bollywood icons Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Ranbir Kapoor attended the wedding and danced to popular Hindi movie songs. Indian cricketers, including icons Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav, were among the invitees. Police imposed traffic diversions around the wedding venue from Friday to Monday to handle the influx of guests who flew to Mumbai, where heavy monsoon rains have caused flooding and flight disruptions for the past week. The extravaganza and the display of opulence that comes with the wedding have led many to raise questions about rising inequality in India, where the gap between rich and poor is growing. The event has also sparked anger among some Mumbai residents, who say they are struggling with snarled traffic. ""It affects our earnings. I don't care much about the wedding,"" said Vikram, a taxi driver who uses only one name. The father of the groom, Mukesh Ambani, is the world's ninth-richest man, with a net worth of $116 billion, according to Forbes. He is the richest person in Asia. His Reliance Industries is a conglomerate reporting over $100 billion in annual revenue, with interests that include petrochemicals, oil and gas, telecoms and retail. The Ambani family owns, among other assets, a 27-story family compound in Mumbai worth $1 billion. The building contains three helipads, a 160-car garage and a private movie theater. The groom, 29-year-old Anant, oversees the conglomerate's renewable and green energy expansion. He also runs a 3,000-acre (about 1,200-hectare) animal rescue center in Gujarat state's Jamnagar, the family's hometown. The bride, Radhika Merchant, also 29, is the daughter of pharmaceutical tycoon Viren Merchant and is the marketing director for his company, Encore Healthcare, according to Vogue. Ambani's critics say his company has relied on political connections during Congress Party-led governments in the 1970s and '80s, and under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rule after 2014. The Ambani family's pre-wedding celebrations have been lavish and star-studded from the start. In March, they threw a three-day prenuptial bash for Anant that had 1,200 guests, including former world leaders, tech tycoons and Bollywood megastars, and performances by Rihanna, Akon and Diljit Dosanjh, a Punjabi singer who shot to international fame when he performed at Coachella. The event was also attended by tech billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. It was the start of lavish, months-long pre-wedding celebrations that grabbed headlines and set off a social media frenzy. In May, the family took guests on a three-day cruise from Italy to France, which included Katy Perry singing her hit song ""Firework"" and a performance by Pitbull, according to media reports. The family also organized a mass wedding for more than 50 underprivileged couples on July 2 as part of the celebrations. Last week, Justin Bieber performed for hundreds of guests at a pre-wedding concert that included performances by Bollywood stars Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh and Salman Khan. Ambani also made headlines in 2018, when Beyoncé performed at pre-wedding festivities for his daughter. Former U.S. Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among those who rubbed shoulders with Indian celebrities and Bollywood stars in the western Indian city of Udaipur. © 2024 The Associated Press.

"""Justin Timberlake's license renewed at DWI hearing, judge praises lawyer's transparency""","Justin Timberlake's license suspended at DWI hearing, judge threatens gag order for lawyer          SAG HARBOR, N.Y. — Justin Timberlake appeared virtually at a Friday hearing for his driving while intoxicated case, where the judge announced the pop star’s driver’s license would be suspended and admonished his lawyer over “irresponsible” comments. Timberlake, 43, wore a black collared shirt for his appearance via video conference from Antwerp, Belgium. Sag Harbor Justice Carl Irace reprimanded the musician’s attorney, Edward Burke Jr., for “irresponsible” comments he made at the last court hearing, adding that it “comes off as an attempt to poison the case before it even begins.” The judge even threatened to issue a gag order if the attorney continued to make such comments. It's not clear which comments the judge was referring to. After considering a motion to dismiss the case against Timberlake, the judge suspended the singer’s license in New York state because he refused to take a breathalyzer test on June 18 when he was pulled over. The license will be suspended for the pendency of the case, according to Burke Jr. The hearing lasted roughly half an hour, ending with Irace again admonishing Burke, urging him to “raise the bar, not lower it.” Burke Jr., spoke to reporters after the hearing, saying that he plans on ""filing motions"" and letting ""the content of those motions and the arguments contained therein speak for themselves.""  Burke Jr., also maintained Timberlake's claim that he was not intoxicated when he was pulled over. When asked about the judge potentially issuing a gag order against him, Burke Jr., said he doesn't see that happening. ""Hey, we all have jobs to do, and we’re obligated to zealously defend our clients, and that’s what I plan on doing,"" he said. The hearing in Sag Harbor, New York, came more than a month after Timberlake was pulled over after he failed field sobriety tests and was arrested on suspicion of intoxicated driving early morning on a Tuesday in the affluent Hamptons area of Long Island. The singer claimed he had just “one martini” before he was pulled over. He pleaded not guilty and his attorney Burke said in a statement at the time: “I look forward to vigorously defending Mr. Timberlake on these allegations. I will have a lot to say at the appropriate time but am currently awaiting full discovery from the District Attorney’s office.” Timberlake was behind the wheel of a gray Florida-registered BMW when he was stopped a little after 12:15 a.m. that Tuesday morning near Madison Street and Middle Line Highway, initially for driving through a stop sign and failing to stay on the right side of the road, according to the criminal complaint. But once police spoke to Timberlake, they said, it was clear he was not in shape to drive, according to the complaint, written by Sag Harbor Village police officer Michael Arkinson. It was “ascertained that the defendant was operating said vehicle in an intoxicated condition in that his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot, and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests,” Arkinson wrote. Timberlake struggled to walk heel-to-toe and stand on one foot without swaying or using arms to balance, the report said. The officer quoted Timberlake as saying: “I had one martini and I followed my friends home.” He also declined to be tested for impairment, said police, who alleged he told them, “No, I’m not doing a chemical test.” NBC News legal analyst Danny Cevallos said: “A refusal can be introduced at trial to establish conscious evidence of guilt. It is the predicate for a revocation of driving privileges.” Timberlake had dined at the American Hotel in Sag Harbor “and then headed to a friend’s house when he was pulled over by police,” a source close to him said. The next conference is set for Aug. 9, which Timberlake is not required to appear for. Another hearing is planned for Sept. 13 but may not take place depending on what happens in August, Burke Jr. said. Timberlake may be required to attend the September date.

Dion performed “L’Hymne à l’amour” by the French singer Édith Piaf, from the Eiffel Tower. Lady Gaga kicked off the Olympics opening ceremony performances with a rendition of Zizi Jeanmaire's ""Mon Truc En Plumes"" on a set of stairs along the Seine River. Surrounded by pink feathers, Gaga's brief set was reminiscent of her Jazz and Piano residency in Las Vegas. It also appeared to pay tribute to Jeanmaire's performance of the song on the Ed Sullivan Show. After descending the stairs, Gaga kicked on a chorus line and played on a piano. The opening ceremony is among the most ambitious to date. Headed by artistic director Thomas Jolly, the event runs along the Seine River. Olympics officials largely kept the performers under wraps ahead of the ceremony. In an Instagram post, Gaga expressed gratitude for the opportunity and celebrated Jeanmaire. She also shared her love for France and the country's culture. ""Although I am not a French artist, I have always felt a very special connection with French people and singing French music—I wanted nothing more than to create a performance that would warm the heart of France, celebrate French art and music, and on such a momentous occasion remind everyone of one of the most magical cities on earth—Paris,"" she wrote in her caption. French-Malian pop star Aya Nakamura, one of the most popular contemporary French artists, also performed Friday. Dion and Gaga sparked a social media frenzy after they were spotted in Paris this week. Dion has been open about how stiff-person syndrome has affected her ability to control her vocal cords and sing. The neurological disorder causes rigidity in the torso and limbs and can induce severe muscle spasms. She released a documentary in June called “I Am: Céline Dion” that shows her experiencing a debilitating muscle spasm. Dion performed at the Olympic opening ceremony during the 1996 Atlanta Games, singing “The Power of the Dream” alongside composer David Foster and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.

Drake drops 'Not Like Us' music video amid Kendrick Lamar feud,"Kendrick Lamar drops 'Not Like Us' music video amid Drake feud          Kendrick Lamar put a cap on his monthslong feud with Drake by releasing a music video for his hit song ""Not Like Us,"" which dissed the Canadian rapper. Lamar released the video on Independence Day. He previously held a concert called ""The Pop Out"" on Juneteenth, where he performed ""Not Like Us"" six times. Many fans viewed the timing of these events as digs toward Drake, whom Lamar accuses of stealing Black American culture in his diss tracks. The ""Not Like Us"" music video had received over 13 million views as of Friday morning. Many fans online praised the video and viewed it as a celebration of Compton, California, where Lamar is from, and the West Coast. Others delighted in Lamar's continued jabs at Drake. The video appears to make several references to Drake, including the inclusion of an owl piñata and a live owl in a cage. The owl is a mascot for Drake's label October's Very Own, or OVO. While Lamar was hitting the piñata, the music video flashed the disclaimer: ""No Ovhoes were harmed during the making of this video."" There are also references to Toronto, where Drake is from, in the video. Mustard, the producer who made the ""Not Like Us"" beat, is featured in the music video wearing a Toronto Blue Jays hat. NBA player DeMar DeRozan, who is from Compton but previously played on the Toronto Raptors, also makes a cameo in the video. Lamar gave DeRozan a shout out in ""Not Like Us"" while dissing Toronto through the line: ""I’m glad DeRoz’ came home/Y’all didn’t deserve him neither."" Lamar also seemingly made fun of some of the claims set forth in Drake's diss tracks against him. He is seen doing pushups on cinder blocks in the video, which people interpreted as a reference to Drake's diss against Lamar, ""Push Ups."" Lamar also featured his fiancée, Whitney Alford, and kids, who Drake claimed were estranged from Lamar. The two rappers have been embroiled in a rap beef since earlier this year. While many fans stuck by their favorite artists, it is broadly believed that Lamar won the battle because of how popular and pervasive ""Not Like Us"" has become. Some said that ""The Pop Out"" concert on Juneteenth was Lamar's ""victory lap"" in his lyrical fight with Drake. Lamar also teased an unreleased track at the beginning of the ""Not Like Us"" video, which fans speculated hinted at a new project from the rapper.

"""The teenage drummer of the Runaways extended her music career in 1977, she’s reimagined it as a board game, Rock Soft: 1978.""","Jackie Fox Saw the Dark Side of Rock. Now She’s Playing Her Own Way.  ADVERTISEMENT  The teenage bassist of the Runaways cut her music career short in 1977. Rather than retell her story, she’s reimagined it as a board game, Rock Hard: 1977. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Amanda Hess Jackie Fox grew up with a guitar in her hand. In 1975, when she was 15 years old, she was pulled off the dance floor at a Hollywood nightclub and recruited to join an all-girl teen rock band. The Runaways became a sensation and tossed Fox and her young bandmates into a turbulent industry that was also violent and sexist. In 1977, Fox quit the band. She never played music professionally again. Now, almost 50 years later, Fox has recast her experience in the form of a board game. In Rock Hard: 1977, Fox has shrunk the chaotic ’70s club scene to the size of a card table. She has written her own rules, anointed new kinds of rock stars and assumed control. Now she can play on her own terms — and win. “As soon as I decided I was going to design a game, I knew it was going to be about becoming a rock star,” Fox, 64, said in a video interview from her Los Angeles home earlier this week. “People have been asking me to ‘tell my story,’ and there are a lot of reasons why I don’t want to sit down and write a book.” After all the years she has spent living and reliving that experience, she wanted to reimagine it — to create a situation where she could have fun. In the game, you play one of 10 characters who are, much like Fox was, musicians on the verge of stardom in 1977. (They each have excellent hair.) As you roll the dice and pull cards, your rock hopeful hops around a board from day job to rehearsal studio, vying to achieve personal goals while growing your reputation and writing songs. Points are tallied on a board styled like an amp that turns up to 11. ADVERTISEMENT As your avatar works her way up from bar mitzvahs to arena stages, you navigate managers, journalists, D.J.s and fans. The game’s protagonists are largely not the white men who dominated the rock scene in the 1970s, but characters representing the diverse musicians who played in clubs and toiled in studios, angling for their shot. You can play as Yolanda Delacroix, an Afro-Cuban studio musician, or “Doc” Sapphire, the androgynous child of Indian immigrants, and the game play is tuned slightly to reflect their experiences. Matt Hyland, the managing director of DevirGames, said that he fished Fox’s cold pitch for Rock Hard out of a customer service email inbox. Many of the games the company makes are quite serious strategy games, but this one actually looked fun. Hyland called from the floor of Gen Con, the largest board game convention in North America, just after the game was loosed on the crowd ahead of its planned Aug. 7 release. “They’re going crazy,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.” In “Rock Hard,” you might pull a card where someone calls you a derogatory term, and you have to decide whether to fight them. You might end up at a frat party full of leering, jeering drunk guys that sets you seriously off your game. Drugs are recast as “candy,” which can hurt you if you’re not careful. But despite the potential pitfalls, the game is designed to raze the music industry into an even playing field, to reimagine the scene as a playground where a girl like Fox can scale to the top. “I wanted to have a hint of that, without really exploring the darker side of it,” Fox said. “There was a darker side.” As a teenager in the San Fernando Valley, Fox — born Jackie Fuchs — played guitar, surfed and overachieved. High school bored her; she imagined graduating early and studying mathematics at U.C.L.A. One night she was plucked from the Starwood nightclub by the Los Angeles scene maker Rodney Bingenheimer and introduced to Kim Fowley, a producer who recruited her into the all-girl band he was assembling, which had grown to include Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, Lita Ford and Sandy West. Fowley handed Fox a bass guitar and a new last name. The band was subject to Fowley’s whims and dangerously objectified by the larger culture of the scene. In an infamous feature in Crawdaddy magazine, the reporter imagined masturbating while watching the girls play. In 2015, after Fowley died, Fox told the full story of her experience in the band for the first time, to Jason Cherkis, an investigative reporter at HuffPost. She said in the early morning of Jan. 1, 1976, she was drugged with quaaludes after a show, and Fowley raped her in front of a crowd backstage as other members of the band watched. (Jett denied she was present; Currie told Cherkis that she spoke up in the moment and left the room.) Fox quit the band the next year. It was decades later that she began to confront the abuse and speak to other women in the room about what happened. Going public was not exactly healing; after the story’s publication, she has said she “woke up in a parallel universe.” But it was worth it to help other women in music. “I know that I am a part, however small, of the lead up to the #MeToo movement,” she said. After quitting the Runaways, Fox hoped to become a manager, to advocate for artists behind the scenes. “I wanted to stay in the music industry because I just love music that much,” she said. But outside the glow of stardom, she still faced harassment. She finally did go to U.C.L.A., where she majored in linguistics and Italian, and then earned a J.D. from Harvard’s law school, where she was classmates with Barack Obama. She become an entertainment lawyer, and eventually wound her way back to music, negotiating song rights in films. In 2018, she went on “Jeopardy!” and won four times. It wasn’t until her third game that she revealed that she had been in the Runaways. “I didn’t want that to define me,” she recalled. About 10 years ago, around the time she started to speak out about Fowley, Fox joined a board game group in Los Angeles, and a few years later, she started designing a game of her own. During the Covid shutdowns of 2020, she played a prototype of Rock Hard alone hundreds of times, embodying every character, seeing the game from every angle. The work helped her discover new angles on her own life, too. Fox spent a lot of time puzzling out how candy ought to work in the game; she was always sober on the road, and her version of “candy” is really candy — chocolate peanut butter cups. “Because I don’t have that thing, I have spent five years really trying to understand it,” she said of addiction. “I’ve spent even more time trying to understand how somebody watches a sexual assault in progress and does nothing to stop it. And I think I do understand that now.” Amanda Wong, who streams about board games on Twitch as Panda8ngel, joined Fox’s board game group in 2019, and was struck by her clever strategies. She had no idea Fox had been a rock star until she invited her on her stream and learned about it live on air. “She really put the ’70s in the game,” Wong said. As she played it with Fox, she realized that many of the event cards hid a tangled back story from Fox’s own life. One of the game’s venues, Panda Palace, is named for Wong. Fox described board games as “a callback to happy times in childhood.” Her own was cut short, and the game has given her the opportunity to access the heady joys of becoming a famous and pioneering rock musician as a teenage girl. “There’s bad blood within the Runaways,” Fox acknowledged, but “I don’t want to live in that space.” Before it all fell apart, “I had fun with every single person who was in the band.” On Thursday, Fox called again, this time from Gen Con at the Indiana Convention Center, where DevirGames had erected a mock stage to promote Rock Hard. By the time she hit the floor that morning, she had already sold out of the 600 units Devir had marked for the show, and now a crowd of fans was waiting for Fox to autograph them. “It reminds me of being in a band,” she said. “The fans are nicer. They wait quietly in line.” Later she sent a picture of a special player card I had not seen before: In a Rock Hard expansion pack, you can play as Jackie Fox herself. “Born in Los Angeles, California, Jackie was a bold and studious child, interested in many things and unwilling to be limited by her gender,” the character’s bio says. “A natural-born lawyer, Jackie enjoys learning and following rules, but she also likes looking for the loopholes.” She can play the game over and over until she wins.

Simien is on the road promoting Hollywood Black, an MGM+ docuseries based on the trailblazing book by scholar Donald Bogle examining race and representation in Hollywood. In an interview with Collider's Christina Radish, Simien vented his feelings over the saga of the stalled series. ""It was pretty developed,"" he shared. ""There was a Bible, there was concept art, there were scripts, but it just wasn’t meant to be."" Ever since the Star Wars cinematic universe expanded to the small screen, there have been so many shelved, canceled, and abandoned projects that critics write listicles and fans fill up Reddit threads discussing which they would have most enjoyed seeing. Simien is a part of a vast network of crestfallen creators, but the camaraderie hasn't soothed the sting. ""For me, it has to be done pretty straight on. Like, ‘I am in grief. I do not feel good.’ I have to let myself feel those feelings,"" he said. ""There’s so much that I experience that I get to keep forever and take into the next project. I can’t obviously take the storyline or the IP or the characters, but there’s so much more that I got, as a maker, and that’s mine. Sorry, it’s too late, you can’t take that part back."" Lando was first announced back in 2020 during a Disney investors' call. In a Star Wars era increasingly defined by backstory spinoffs, the move made perfect sense. Glover's Lando was the breakout star of Solo, and Simien was a rising star with three seasons of Dear White People, the series he created, directed, and wrote for Netflix, under his belt. Fans grew even more excited about the series when it was announced that Glover and his brother Stephen, the showrunner on Atlanta and a producer of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, would step in as co-writers. Exactly why Lando fell through the cracks at Disney+ is still unclear.

Simien remains undeterred, however, bringing Hollywood Black to MGM+ and looking forward a live-action Star Trek comedy series starring Tawny Newsome.

The Bear shatters comedy series record with 32 Emmys nominations: See the full list,"‘The Bear’ Breaks Emmy Record for Comedy Series With 23 Nominations   By Clayton Davis  It’s serious — “The Bear” just broke the Emmy record for a comedy series. The second season of the hit FX series, which aired in June 2023, led the tally for comedy series with 23 nominations, including outstanding comedy series. It now surpasses the 22-nomination Emmy record held by NBC’s “30 Rock” since 2009. The all-time series record of 32 nominations, held by HBO’s “Game of Thrones” since 2016, remains firmly in place. In addition, the show picked up major nominations for lead comedy actor (Jeremy Allen White), lead comedy actress (Ayo Edebiri), supporting comedy actor (Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Lionel Boyce), supporting comedy actress (Liza Colón-Zayas), directing (Storer for “Fishes” and Ramy Youssef for “Honeydew” TK) and writing (“Fishes” by Joanna Calo and Storer).  The guest comedy categories were also brimming with nominations for the series, including mentions for Jon Bernthal, Jamie Lee Curtis, Olivia Colman, Bob Odenkirk and Will Poulter) Colman and Poulter are the only actors not nominated for the episode “Fishes.”  With its robust number of acting nominations, the show came close to standing alongside “Succession’s” back-to-back records set in 2022 and 2023 when it landed 14 mentions, surpassing the limited series “Roots,” which had previously held the record with 13. The divisions between comedy and drama categorization at the Emmys have become increasingly tenuous in recent years. In the comedy series category, “The Bear” will compete against “Abbott Elementary,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Hacks,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “Palm Royale,” “Reservation Dogs” and “What We Do in Shadows.” Created by Christopher Storer, the dramedy follows Carmy (White), an award-winning chef who returns to his hometown of Chicago to manage his brother’s sandwich shop following his suicide. The Season 3 premiere of “The Bear,” which dropped on June 22, reached 5.4 million views in its first four days of streaming, marking the best performance for an FX premiere on Hulu and the most-watched season premiere for any scripted series. The Creative Arts and Governors Gala ceremonies will occur over two nights on Sept. 7-8. The 76th Primetime Emmy Awards will air on ABC on Sunday, Sept. 15.

"""Francis Ford Coppola Refused to Kiss in 'Megalopolis' Set Video: 'I Was Not Shocked'.""","Video of Megalopolis director Francis Ford Coppola kissing extras emerges after he denies being ‘touchy-feely’  NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Seemingly damning footage of Megalopolis director Francis Ford Coppola has emerged – only weeks after he denied being ‘touchy-feely’ on the set of his $120,000,000 comeback movie. The Apocalypse Now and Godfather director, 85, issued a statement in June, denying allegations of inappropriate behaviour on the set of his latest film. The forthcoming sci-fi blockbuster, which stars Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito and Shia LaBeouf, has been plagued with controversy since its director was accused of pulling women to sit on his lap and trying to kiss numerous extras during a nightclub scene. Coppola denied the allegations, claiming that he could never be a predator due to his upbringing and the respect for women instilled in him by his mother. However, recently leaked footage obtained from the set of Megalopolis seems to contradict Coppola’s version of events. Two videos, said to be taken by a crewmember, seem to show the director navigating a crowded dancefloor, while trying to pull several female extras in for a kiss. The videos, obtained by Variety, were filmed during the making of the film’s bacchanalian nightclub scene – and back up allegations made in May. A source told the US entertainment magazine: ‘I’ve worked with really important directors and that behavior is uncommon — the most I’ve ever seen any director do is say something like, “high energy, guys.” I’ve never seen anyone on set, and this extends to a camera operator, so much as touch an actor.” The source continued, saying how Coppola announced via megaphone: ‘Sorry, if I come up to you and kiss you. Just know it’s solely for my pleasure.’ Another source said: ‘Because Coppola funded it there was no HR department to keep things in check. Who were they supposed to talk to? Complain to Coppola and report Coppola to himself?’ The film did have two intimacy coordinators, but neither were present during the nightclub scene. ‘I can’t really speak to the reason why they chose to bring us in when they did and not when they didn’t,’ said intimacy coordinator Samantha McDonald. Metro.co.uk has contacted a rep for Francis Ford Coppola for further comment. Coppola was previously defended by his co-producer and first assistant director, Darren Demetre. Demetre told The Guardian: ‘I was never aware of any complaints of harrassment or ill behaviour during the course of the project. I have known and worked with Francis and his family for over 35 years. ‘There were two days when we shot a celebratory Studio 54-esque club scene where Francis walked around the set to establish the spirit of the scene by giving kind hugs and kisses on the cheek to the cast and background players. 2024’s most controversial film in new 'fakery' storm as bosses admit they 'screwed up' Ryan Gosling thriller becomes one of Netflix’s most streamed movies Netflix fans left 'sobbing' after 'silly little comedy' turns out to be hidden gem Fans of classic 90s film are finding out about its link to bizarre 9/11 conspiracy ‘It was his way to help inspire and establish the club atmosphere, which was so important to the film,’ he added. This marks more bad news for the director’s passion project, which has already been dubbed ‘the worst film of 2024.’ Its release at Cannes was derailed when reports first emerged of Coppola’s alleged impropriety toward female extras. This followed personal tragedy for the director, when his wife, Eleanor Coppola, died only months earlier, in April. Meanwhile, a recent report by The Hollywood Reporter claimed that Coppola will be responsible for covering the film’s $15m (£11.8m) to $20m (£15.8m) marketing campaign himself – meaning that it will cost him more than $135m (£106m) when all is said and done.

 Elizabeth Taylor and Faye Dunaway Ruined Star Power As A Craft,"Elizabeth Taylor and Faye Dunaway Made Star Power Into an Art — These HBO Docs Prove It   By Daniel D'Addario  There’s something that unites the recent documentaries “Faye” and “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes.” It isn’t just that both played on HBO — “Faye” launched in July, while “Elizabeth Taylor” is to premiere August 3 — or that both center the stories of legendary, Oscar-winning performers. Faye is, of course, Faye Dunaway, of “Network” and “Chinatown,” while Elizabeth Taylor, one of the most decadently media-hounded figures of the 20th Century, practically needs no introduction at all.  What the films share, though, is a poignant and sometimes painful double yearning. In the documentaries, Dunaway — still with us at age 83, and interviewed recently for this film — and Taylor — who died in 2011 but whose “lost tapes” catalogue an extensive 1964 debriefing with journalist Richard Meryman —  both express doubt, anxiety and even shame for career missteps, misbegotten projects and the ways in which their private troubles played out in public view. The viewer feels for them, first because they are human, and then because their manner of expressing their emotions is so extravagantly more than human. That’s the other yearning at the heart of these documentaries: a sense that the culture can no longer produce great actresses who are, too, stars who glitter quite this brightly.  Both films, happily, are stuffed full of film clips, and both give a sense of their respective subjects’ styles. In director Laurent Bouzereau’s curation in “Faye,” Dunaway, at her best, uses a bracing sense of control in order to shock the viewer all the more when she snaps in grand fashion. (The famous photograph of her the morning after winning her Oscar — used as the featured image in this column — in which she’s gazing into the middle distance, is a supreme example of her powers: We’re seeing, through exhaustion and exhilaration, a woman in utter control of the image she wants to present.) In interviews with the press, Dunaway, while seeming to hold her feelings back, has a relentless erudition and quickness that makes clear just how much of herself was in “Network’s” brilliant executive, or “Chinatown’s” tricky femme fatale. Her interview for the documentary feels like a sort of letting-go, an unburdening of thoughts she might have withheld from the press to this point. But the clarity of thought remains intact.   Meanwhile, filmmaker Nanette Burstein shows Taylor, for all the outsizedness of her fame, carrying herself on screen with a funny self-deprecation, a shrewdness that feels decades ahead of her time. We’re told that Taylor was 32 when she played the fiftysomething Martha in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” and while her physical transformation for the role is indeed impressive, it’s the changes to her soul and bearing — her willingness to flaunt her signs of age in a sort of ironic self-deprecation — that feels most remarkable. And both actors are startingly open about career and personal setbacks they faced, including the public’s coming to pigeonhole them. Dunaway speaks about her bipolar diagnosis and her struggles with alcohol, both things that derailed her ability to trust her great gift, her clear and precise thinking. (Both, also, led to her outsized reputation as a difficult colleague — her composure giving way to a great break isn’t just something that happened for Dunaway onscreen.) And we also get an unpacking of why “Mommie Dearest” — the infamous bomb that toppled her career — was such a severe disappointment. Dunaway believed she was really finding something sharp and true in her depiction of Joan Crawford as an abusive mother, and lost herself in the role so deeply that she couldn’t find her way, in the absence of a surer directorial hand, to coherence. Others who speak in “Faye,” including her son, are better-situated than is Dunaway to judge why it is that she takes a particular project’s failure so hard. Publicity-shy even despite her doing a sweeping interview toward the end of her life, Dunaway poured her personal setbacks and challenges into her work. To reject it, perhaps, is to reject her. Meanwhile, Taylor speaks with sharp frankness about, for instance, her dislike of the film “Butterfield 8” (for which she won her first Oscar, which Taylor credits to sympathy for health struggles she was undergoing) and the dramas of filming “Cleopatra,” which she shot with Richard Burton, one of the loves of her life. Taylor and Burton — two stars of exaggerated appetites, talents and passions — strode atop the world. But their notoriety came with its own frustrations for someone who’d wanted, first, to tell stories: “It’s a losing game!,” Taylor tells Meryman. “People already have a set image. They want to believe either the good or the bad. And if you try and explain, then you lose yourself along the way.”  And we see Taylor’s performance of herself as someone increasingly willing to display her frustration with the press. Asked, at a joint press conference with Burton, about her relationship with ex-husband Eddie Fisher, Taylor snaps “Do you read the papers, love? I suggest you do,” then rolls her eyes and tosses her head back. Later, she tells a journalist from “60 Minutes” that “fighting is one of the greatest exercises in marital togetherness”; when the journalist asks if Burton dominates her in their marriage, she widens those famous eyes and blurts “You must be joking!” That it seems almost like an impulse, rather than the ongoing press approach of someone eager to communicate her weariness with the press’ rapaciousness, is a sign of just how gifted an actress Taylor was.  “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes” constructs, methodically, a case for Taylor as a genius both of performing onscreen and at performing for a sort of media that no longer exists. Both Dunaway, an actress who made a point of revealing as little as possible, and Taylor, one who was willing to give it all away — but with a wink that made the consumer aware that she saw herself being consumed — existed in a media climate both rougher and more predictable than today’s.  That media climate was cruel and heartbreaking to those who became its subjects; it also made legends. No one, likely, would trade today’s way of writing about actresses, for all its flaws, for the way Dunaway and Taylor were written about. And yet other aspects of the culture were better-situated to create legends. Dunaway, reflecting, begins to see, in the work she made, an impact on the world; Taylor leveraged her fame not merely for movieland success but for charitable pursuits astounding in their magnitude and timeliness. (In an exceptional clip in the Taylor documentary, Taylor explains why she began fundraising for the fight against AIDS: Few were speaking out or doing anything, and, she says, “it so angered me that I thought, ‘Bitch, do something yourself!’”) We don’t make stars the way we did in Dunaway and Taylor’s era these days. And that’s a good thing. But, for all the ascendant actors who compel in their own ways, watching these women, in two very strong entries in the celebrity-tells-all canon, can convince a viewer, for a moment, that we don’t, anymore, make them at all. “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes” premieres on HBO and Max on Aug. 3; “Faye” is streaming on Max. 0 Comments Comments are moderated.

Vary  “Star Trek” is preparing to beam up some laughter. Actor-writer Tawny Newsome (“Star Trek: Lower Decks”) and writer-director Justin Simien (“Dear White People,” “Haunted Mansion”) are developing a new live-action comedy set in the world of the storied sci-fi franchise. The show will be set in the 25th century.

BOLLYWOOD Before Rana Daggubati, Game of Thrones and Aquaman-fame Jason Momoa was approached to play the antagonist Bhallaladeva in the SS Rajamouli-directed epic action films Baahubali. Aman Wadhwa Updated : Aug 03, 2024, 07:07 PM IST   Edited by : Aman Wadhwa The two-part epic action films Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion follows the war of succession between Amarendra Baahubali and his older cousin brother Bhallaladeva. As Amarendra Baahubali dies in the climax of the first part, his son Mahendra Baahubali goes back to Mahishmati to avenge his father's death and reclaim his throne. Prabhas played the father and the son in a double role and Rana Daggubati played the antagonist Bhallaladeva in the films directed by SS Rajamouli. Modern Masters: SS Rajamouli is the latest Netflix documentary showcasing how SS Rajamouli has become one of the greatest filmmakers in the world. The 74-minute documentary, which premiered on Netflix on August 2, features interviews from his family members and the superstars featured in his blockbuster films - Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Ram Charan, and Jr NTR. In the documentary, Rana Daggubati revealed that he wasn't the first choice to play the villain in the Baahubali films. The makers had first tried to approach the Hollywood star Jason Momoa, who had become popular in India after playing Khal Drogo in the first two seasons of Game of Thrones in 2011 and 2012. Recalling when he was approached for the Baahubali films, Rana Daggubati said in the documentary, ""The producer, Shobu Yarlagadda, came and just told me that it's a period war-based kind of film and that they were looking at me playing the antagonist. I replied that I'd love to have a narration. I also asked him, 'Who's the actor you went to before you came to me?'. He said, 'We tried to reach Jason Momoa from Game Of Thrones!'. I said, 'Okay, that's a good second number'."" Both the films became the most expensive Indian movies at the time of their releases. Made in Rs 180 crore, Baahubali: The Beginning grossed Rs 650 crore worldwide in 2015, and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion was made in Rs 250 crore and minted Rs 1800 crore at the global box office in 2017. The sequel still remains the second-highest grossing Indian film of all time.

Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah's Daya Ben aka Disha Vakani earned this whopping amount from show before...     BOLLYWOOD Kriti Sanon's fans have rallied behind her over the recent viral video that appeared to show her smoking Abhimanyu Mathur Updated : Aug 01, 2024, 10:39 PM IST Kriti Sanon is currently in Greece vacationing with friends and family. The actress rang in her 34th birthday in the Mediterranean nation last week. But things soured after a video of hers purportedly smoking there went viral. Many trolls attacked the actress calling her a hypocrite given that she had vehemently stated she is anti-smoking in earlier interviews. Now, a section of the internet has come out in Kriti’s defence, slamming trolls for invading her privacy and filming a private moment. The video appears to show Kriti sitting by the oceanside smoking a cigarette. The video has been shot from far and does not show with clarity what the actress is holding. However, fans said that it need not be a concern even if she is smoking. Reacting to the video, one Twitter user said, “Let her live her life and enjoy her vacation. What is the fuss here I don't know.” A comment on Reddit added that what she does in her private life should not be criticised. “Ehh who cares? As long as she's not promoting it, she can do whatever she wants in her private life,” read the comment.  Many actually slammed the person who shot and posted the video online, arguing that it constitutes an invasion of privacy as the actress was in her private space at the time. One fan asked, “Is it okay to click pics without permission??? She isn't in some media promotion event, it's her private life.” Many supported this argument. One comment read, “Just because they're famous, doesn't mean you're not going to respect their personal space or invade their privacy. They don't owe us that.” Kriti Sanon was last seen on screen in the comedy heist film Crew. Not only was the film a box office success but the actress also  impressed everyone with her performance in. Kriti will be next seen in the movie Do Patti, which is also produced by her. The film marks her second collaboration with Kajol after Dilwale and is currently under production. The DNA app is now available for download on the Google Play Store.

"""Freedom At Midnight spoiler: Historical drama reveals how Sardar Patel overshadowed Mahatma Gandhi, appointed Nehru as India's PM""","‘Freedom at Midnight’ to expose why Sardar Patel was kept away from becoming India’s first PM  The teaser depicts a scene where Mahatma Gandhi asks Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to withdraw his nomination for the position of India’s first Prime Minister, paving the way for Jawaharlal Nehru.  Mumbai: The teaser for the upcoming period streaming show ‘Freedom at Midnight’ was unveiled on Tuesday, offering a glimpse into the political tensions during the final stages of India’s independence, which ultimately led to the partition of India, considered the largest migration in human history. The teaser depicts a scene where Mahatma Gandhi asks Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to withdraw his nomination for the position of India’s first Prime Minister, paving the way for Jawaharlal Nehru. The atmosphere inside the room shifts dramatically as Gandhi hands the withdrawal letter to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Historically, Gandhi had favoured Nehru for the Congress presidency over Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in 1929, 1937, and 1946. India’s first President, Rajendra Prasad, had expressed his displeasure over Gandhi “sacrificing his trusted lieutenant (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel) for the sake of the glamorous Nehru.” The series features a stellar cast, including Sidhant Gupta as Jawaharlal Nehru, Chirag Vohra as Mahatma Gandhi, Rajendra Chawla as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Arif Zakaria as Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Ira Dubey as Fatima Jinnah, Malishka Mendonsa as Sarojini Naidu, Rajesh Kumar as Liaquat Ali Khan, KC Shankar as V.P. Menon, Luke McGibney as Lord Louis Mountbatten, Cordelia Bugeja as Lady Edwina Mountbatten, Alistair Finlay as Archibald Wavell, Andrew Cullum as Clement Attlee, and Richard Teverson as Cyril Radcliffe in pivotal roles. ‘Freedom at Midnight’ is based on the eponymous book by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins. The series delves into the motivations, conflicts, and sacrifices of key figures such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Produced by Emmay Entertainment (Monisha Advani and Madhu Bhojwani) in association with StudioNext and Sony LIV, the series is set to stream on Sony LIV.     © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

He confessed that series creator and filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali didn’t direct many of his scenes, and said that he would have loved to have had more of a say in how his character was presented in the show. Appearing on the Inside the Mind with Rushabh podcast, Jason revealed that he raised his concerns, but that if he’d registered more complaints, he would have been labelled a ‘problem maker’. Asked why he felt dissatisfied, Jason explained, “It was his first time (doing a web series).

It had the capacity, I feel.” Also read – Heeramandi’s Jason Shah opens up about differences in opinion with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, says assistants directed most of his scenes Jason said that there was a ‘lack of communication’ on set, as opposed to there being ‘miscommunication’. He said that he could’ve done more with Cartwright had he been given more freedom. “What didn’t happen was the depth of the character. If you look at Gandhi, with Ben Kingsley, they really show how far racism can go, and the dichotomy between who someone thinks they are, and another human being…” Asked if he raised these concerns with Bhansali, Jason replied with a laugh, “I think I said enough. I would’ve become a problem maker if I said more.” Previously, Jason had said that the Heeramandi set lacked ‘the basic niceties of human nature’, as he complained about being kept in the dark about creative decisions, and being made to complete all his scenes at the end of the day, in a limited amount of time. He also revealed that Bhansali’s assistants directed most of his scenes, and that he would often get conflicting direction from different people. Set in pre-Independence India, Heeramandi revolved around the lives of courtesans and noblemen in Lahore. The show received mixed reviews, with praise for Bhansali’s vision, but criticism for some performances. A second season has been announced.

"""Atheist SS Rajamouli admits he never prayed to God, despite his wife 'bleeding profusely' after a car crash.""","Atheist SS Rajamouli Says Even His Wife In Critical Condition Couldn't Make Him Pray To God: 'Absolutely Terrified'  In the grand tapestry of Indian cinema, SS Rajamouli stands out as a master storyteller who weaves mythological themes into his blockbuster epics. But don't let the divine grandeur of his films fool you—Rajamouli himself doesn't believe in a higher power. In fact, the man behind the cinematic spectacles RRR and the Baahubali series is a staunch atheist, a stance he held firm even during one of the most harrowing experiences of his life. In the recently released Netflix documentary Modern Masters: SS Rajamouli, the filmmaker opens up about his atheism, which, as it turns out, wasn't even shaken by the most personal of crises. Rajamouli recounts a particularly terrifying incident when his wife, Rama Rajamouli, was gravely injured in a road accident while he was shooting the epic Magadheera, starring Ram Charan. The accident occurred in a remote location, leaving them far from immediate medical help. A post shared by Netflix India (@netflix_in) As Rajamouli described it, the situation was dire: ""I froze after the accident, and began crying. My wife was bleeding profusely and was paralyzed in her lower back from shock."" Despite the chaos, the thought of turning to a deity for intervention never crossed his mind. ""The nearest hospital was 60 kms away. I was absolutely terrified. At the back of my mind, a thought erupted, 'Am I praying to God to help me?' But I didn’t do that. I just frantically cried and kept calling doctors and kept doing what needed to be done,"" he recounted. For Rajamouli, this ordeal was less about divine intervention and more about action. ""I think, at some point, I chose karma yoga as my way of life. My work is my god. I have huge respect for cinema,"" he added. It's a pragmatic approach that probably wouldn't make for a great mythological plot, but it clearly works for him. The documentary also features Rajamouli's father, writer V Vijayendra Prasad, who offers an intriguing perspective on his son's lack of religious belief. Despite being part of a ""heavily spiritually inclined"" family, Prasad expresses no disappointment. In fact, he seems to respect Rajamouli's stance: ""For a person practicing atheism, there should be a high moral fiber in them. I have high respect for such a person.""",False,False,False
"""Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt's anticipated movie 'The Rise Man' receives mixed reviews for including a humorous take on Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's divorce.""","Ryan Gosling’s The Fall Guy under fire over inappropriate joke involving Johnny Depp and Amber Heard  Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt’s The Fall Guy is yet to release in the theatres, but it has already come under scanner for all the wrong reasons. The Hollywood film is receiving a lot of backlash for featuring a joke about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's “abusive marriage”. (Also read – The Fall Guy movie review: Ryan Gosling, Emily Blunt rise to the occasion in this breezy, bumpy adventure) In the action comedy film, which has been directed by David Leitch, actor Hannah Waddingham’s character, Gail Meyer, at one point makes a reference to Johnny and Amber‘s turbulent relationship, which has caused a stir among viewers. In the scene, Waddingham, who is essaying the role of an executive producer in the movie, walks into a trailer while looking rumpled and tells director Jody Moreno, essayed by Emily, “It’s like Amber and Johnny were just in here”. The line of dialogue has caused some discourse among viewers who have watched the film at screenings. They are taking to social media to express their dismay. The estranged celebrity couple accused each other of domestic violence and abuse since their split in 2016. “Domestic violence is not a joke,” wrote one X user, with one sharing, “As a survivor I can tell you there is not one thing funny about domestic abuse. I will not support this film. Do better Hollywood”. “Oh wow…domestic violence is now a punchline? Disgusting,” wrote another netizen. One user called the joke as “terrible and tasteless”. “That’s basically a throwaway comment muttered under breath, but it earned absolutely ZERO laughs in my screening,” shared the social media user. Several Hollywood portals reached out to Universal Pictures, The Fall Guy’s distributor, for a comment. However, they have not yet responded to the same. After tying the knot in 2015, Johnny and Amber ended their marital union in 15 months. However, it was not a smooth ending as their split caught the public eye in 2019 when Johnny sued his ex-wife for defamation. In 2018, Amber published a Washington Post op-ed about domestic violence. Though she didn't mention him by name in the article, Johnny claimed it came with hints at him. It led to a court battle, which included both actors making allegations of physical, emotional and mental abuse against each other. In December 2022, the legal battle ended with the Pirates of the Caribbean star winning all three defamation claims and millions in damages. Heard also brought a countersuit against Depp, in which she won one of three defamation claims and was awarded $2 million in damages.

Rahul Gandhi to retain Wayanad Lok Sabha seat,"Why did Rahul Gandhi retain Rae Bareli over Wayanad? Mallikarjun Kharge says…  The suspense over “Wayanad or Rae Bareli” has finally ended, as Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is set to take the electoral plunge from Kerala. During a pivotal Congress core meeting, it was decided that Rahul Gandhi would keep the family bastion of Rae Bareli, while his sister, Priyanka, would run for the seat in Wayanad – a seat that embraced the former Congress president in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In India, people are allowed to contest in multiple constituencies but they can only represent one in Parliament and for days, which seat Rahul Gandhi would choose to retain was the subject of keen interest. Announcing the Congress decision, party chief Mallikarjun Kharge said, “Rahul Gandhi won from two Lok Saba seats but as per the law, he has to vacate one seat. Rahul Gandhi will retain Rae Bareli and we have decided that Priyanka ji will fight from Wayanad.” Explaining why Rahul Gandhi chose Rae Bareli over Wayanad, Mallikarjun Kharge said the decision was emotional because the Gandhi family has been fighting from this seat for generations. “Rahul Gandhi will retain his Raebareli seat because Raebareli has been close to him from before, that (area) has great attachment to the family, they have been fighting (in elections) from there for generations,” he said. Congress has won Rae Bareli 17 of 20 times the elections were held and Rahul Gandhi's mother Sonia has held the seat since 2004. She is now a member of Rajya Sabha. Rahul Gandhi won Rae Bareli by defeating BJP's Dinesh Pratap Singh by a margin of 390,030 votes. He also won in Wayanad by defeating Communist Party of India-Marxist candidate Annie Raja by 364,422 votes. Priyanka Gandhi's electoral debut was anticipated even in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but she did not contest the elections. If she is elected from Wayanad in the Lok Sabha bypolls, this will be the first time that all three Gandhi family members - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka - will be in Parliament together. Rahul Gandhi said it was a difficult decision for him as she has an emotional relationship with both Rae Bareli and Wayanad but promised that if Priyanka is elected from the Kerala seat, “he will keep visiting.” ""The last five years as an MP of Wayanad have been a fantastic and enjoyable experience. The people of Wayanad gave me support and gave me energy to fight at a very difficult time. I will never forget that. All the people of Wayanad gave me a lot of love and I thank them from my heart. I will visit Wayanad and will fulfil our promises made,"" he said. Rahul Gandhi further added that he has an old relation with Rae Bareli and “I am very happy that I will be representing it.""

"""Defense Secretary John Doe III relinquished control of the case, effectively removing the death penalty from consideration.""","The Case Against the Death Penalty           The American Civil Liberties Union believes the death penalty inherently violates the constitutional ban against cruel and unusual punishment and the guarantees of due process of law and of equal protection under the law. Furthermore, we believe that the state should not give itself the right to kill human beings – especially when it kills with premeditation and ceremony, in the name of the law or in the name of its people, and when it does so in an arbitrary and discriminatory fashion. Capital punishment is an intolerable denial of civil liberties and is inconsistent with the fundamental values of our democratic system. The death penalty is uncivilized in theory and unfair and inequitable in practice. Through litigation, legislation, and advocacy against this barbaric and brutal institution, we strive to prevent executions and seek the abolition of capital punishment. The ACLU’s opposition to capital punishment incorporates the following fundamental concerns: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took placePeople of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime. They ranked increasing the number of police officers, reducing drug abuse, and creating a better economy with more jobs higher than the death penalty as the best ways to reduce violence. The FBI has found the states with the death penalty have the highest murder rates. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death. Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence. Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed. INTRODUCTION TO THE “MODERN ERA” OF THE DEATH PENALTY IN THE UNITED STATES In 1972, the Supreme Court declared that under then-existing laws ""the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty… constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments."" (Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238). The Court, concentrating its objections on the manner in which death penalty laws had been applied, found the result so ""harsh, freakish, and arbitrary"" as to be constitutionally unacceptable. Making the nationwide impact of its decision unmistakable, the Court summarily reversed death sentences in the many cases then before it, which involved a wide range of state statutes, crimes and factual situations. But within four years after the Furman decision, several hundred persons had been sentenced to death under new state capital punishment statutes written to provide guidance to juries in sentencing. These statutes require a two-stage trial procedure, in which the jury first determines guilt or innocence and then chooses imprisonment or death in the light of aggravating or mitigating circumstances. In 1976, the Supreme Court moved away from abolition, holding that ""the punishment of death does not invariably violate the Constitution."" The Court ruled that the new death penalty statutes contained ""objective standards to guide, regularize, and make rationally reviewable the process for imposing the sentence of death."" (Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153). Subsequently 38 state legislatures and the Federal government enacted death penalty statutes patterned after those the Court upheld in Gregg. Congress also enacted and expanded federal death penalty statutes for peacetime espionage by military personnel and for a vast range of categories of murder. Executions resumed in 1977. In 2002, the Supreme Court held executions of mentally retarded criminals are “cruel and unusual punishments” prohibited by the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. Since then, states have developed a range of processes to ensure that mentally retarded individuals are not executed. Many have elected to hold proceedings prior to the merits trial, many with juries, to determine whether an accused is mentally retarded. In 2005, the Supreme Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution forbid imposition of the death penalty on offenders who were under the age of 18 when their crimes were committed, resulting in commutation of death sentences to life for dozens of individuals across the country. As of August 2012, over 3,200 men and women are under a death sentence and more than 1,300 men, women and children (at the time of the crime) have been executed since 1976. ACLU OBJECTIONS TO THE DEATH PENALTY Despite the Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in Gregg v. Georgia, et al, the ACLU continues to oppose capital punishment on moral, practical, and constitutional grounds: Capital punishment is cruel and unusual. It is cruel because it is a relic of the earliest days of penology, when slavery, branding, and other corporal punishments were commonplace. Like those barbaric practices, executions have no place in a civilized society. It is unusual because only the United States of all the western industrialized nations engages in this punishment. It is also unusual because only a random sampling of convicted murderers in the United States receive a sentence of death. Capital punishment denies due process of law. Its imposition is often arbitrary, and always irrevocable – forever depriving an individual of the opportunity to benefit from new evidence or new laws that might warrant the reversal of a conviction, or the setting aside of a death sentence. The death penalty violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. It is applied randomly – and discriminatorily. It is imposed disproportionately upon those whose victims are white, offenders who are people of color, and on those who are poor and uneducated and concentrated in certain geographic regions of the country. The death penalty is not a viable form of crime control. When police chiefs were asked to rank the factors that, in their judgment, reduce the rate of violent crime, they mentioned curbing drug use and putting more officers on the street, longer sentences and gun control. They ranked the death penalty as least effective. Politicians who preach the desirability of executions as a method of crime control deceive the public and mask their own failure to identify and confront the true causes of crime. Capital punishment wastes limited resources. It squanders the time and energy of courts, prosecuting attorneys, defense counsel, juries, and courtroom and law enforcement personnel. It unduly burdens the criminal justice system, and it is thus counterproductive as an instrument for society's control of violent crime. Limited funds that could be used to prevent and solve crime (and provide education and jobs) are spent on capital punishment. Opposing the death penalty does not indicate a lack of sympathy for murder victims. On the contrary, murder demonstrates a lack of respect for human life. Because life is precious and death irrevocable, murder is abhorrent, and a policy of state-authorized killings is immoral. It epitomizes the tragic inefficacy and brutality of violence, rather than reason, as the solution to difficult social problems. Many murder victims do not support state-sponsored violence to avenge the death of their loved one. Sadly, these victims have often been marginalized by politicians and prosecutors, who would rather publicize the opinions of pro-death penalty family members. Changes in death sentencing have proved to be largely cosmetic. The defects in death-penalty laws, conceded by the Supreme Court in the early 1970s, have not been appreciably altered by the shift from unrestrained discretion to ""guided discretion."" Such so-called “reforms” in death sentencing merely mask the impermissible randomness of a process that results in an execution. A society that respects life does not deliberately kill human beings. An execution is a violent public spectacle of official homicide, and one that endorses killing to solve social problems – the worst possible example to set for the citizenry, and especially children. Governments worldwide have often attempted to justify their lethal fury by extolling the purported benefits that such killing would bring to the rest of society. The benefits of capital punishment are illusory, but the bloodshed and the resulting destruction of community decency are real. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS NOT A DETERRENT TO CAPITAL CRIMES Deterrence is a function not only of a punishment's severity, but also of its certainty and frequency. The argument most often cited in support of capital punishment is that the threat of execution influences criminal behavior more effectively than imprisonment does. As plausible as this claim may sound, in actuality the death penalty fails as a deterrent for several reasons. A punishment can be an effective deterrent only if it is consistently and promptly employed. Capital punishment cannot be administered to meet these conditions. The proportion of first-degree murderers who are sentenced to death is small, and of this group, an even smaller proportion of people are executed. Although death sentences in the mid-1990s increased to about 300 per year, this is still only about one percent of all homicides known to the police. Of all those convicted on a charge of criminal homicide, only 3 percent – about 1 in 33 – are eventually sentenced to death. Between 2001-2009, the average number of death sentences per year dropped to 137, reducing the percentage even more. This tiny fraction of convicted murderers do not represent the “worst of the worst”. Mandatory death sentencing is unconstitutional. The possibility of increasing the number of convicted murderers sentenced to death and executed by enacting mandatory death penalty laws was ruled unconstitutional in 1976 (Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280). A considerable time between the imposition of the death sentence and the actual execution is unavoidable, given the procedural safeguards required by the courts in capital cases. Starting with selecting the trial jury, murder trials take far longer when the ultimate penalty is involved. Furthermore, post-conviction appeals in death-penalty cases are far more frequent than in other cases. These factors increase the time and cost of administering criminal justice. We can reduce delay and costs only by abandoning the procedural safeguards and constitutional rights of suspects, defendants, and convicts – with the attendant high risk of convicting the wrong person and executing the innocent. This is not a realistic prospect: our legal system will never reverse itself to deny defendants the right to counsel, or the right to an appeal. Persons who commit murder and other crimes of personal violence often do not premeditate their crimes. Most capital crimes are committed in the heat of the moment. Most capital crimes are committed during moments of great emotional stress or under the influence of drugs or alcohol, when logical thinking has been suspended. Many capital crimes are committed by the badly emotionally-damaged or mentally ill. In such cases, violence is inflicted by persons unable to appreciate the consequences to themselves as well as to others. Even when crime is planned, the criminal ordinarily concentrates on escaping detection, arrest, and conviction. The threat of even the severest punishment will not discourage those who expect to escape detection and arrest. It is impossible to imagine how the threat of any punishment could prevent a crime that is not premeditated. Furthermore, the death penalty is a futile threat for political terrorists, like Timothy McVeigh, because they usually act in the name of an ideology that honors its martyrs. Capital punishment doesn't solve our society's crime problem. Threatening capital punishment leaves the underlying causes of crime unaddressed, and ignores the many political and diplomatic sanctions (such as treaties against asylum for international terrorists) that could appreciably lower the incidence of terrorism. Capital punishment has been a useless weapon in the so-called ""war on drugs."" The attempt to reduce murders in the drug trade by threat of severe punishment ignores the fact that anyone trafficking in illegal drugs is already risking his life in violent competition with other dealers. It is irrational to think that the death penalty – a remote threat at best – will avert murders committed in drug turf wars or by street-level dealers. If, however, severe punishment can deter crime, then permanent imprisonment is severe enough to deter any rational person from committing a violent crime. The vast preponderance of the evidence shows that the death penalty is no more effective than imprisonment in deterring murder and that it may even be an incitement to criminal violence. Death-penalty states as a group do not have lower rates of criminal homicide than non-death-penalty states. Use of the death penalty in a given state may actually increase the subsequent rate of criminal homicide. Why? Perhaps because ""a return to the exercise of the death penalty weakens socially based inhibitions against the use of lethal force to settle disputes…. "" In adjacent states – one with the death penalty and the other without it – the state that practices the death penalty does not always show a consistently lower rate of criminal homicide. For example, between l990 and l994, the homicide rates in Wisconsin and Iowa (non-death-penalty states) were half the rates of their neighbor, Illinois – which restored the death penalty in l973, and by 1994 had sentenced 223 persons to death and carried out two executions. Between 2000-2010, the murder rate in states with capital punishment was 25-46% higher than states without the death penalty. On-duty police officers do not suffer a higher rate of criminal assault and homicide in abolitionist states than they do in death-penalty states. Between 1976 and 1989, for example, lethal assaults against police were not significantly more or less frequent in abolitionist states than in death-penalty states. Capital punishment did not appear to provide officers added protection during that time frame. In fact, the three leading states in law enforcement homicide in 1996 were also very active death penalty states: California (highest death row population), Texas (most executions since 1976), and Florida (third highest in executions and death row population). The South, which accounts for more than 80% of the country’s executions, also has the highest murder rate of any region in the country. If anything, the death penalty incited violence rather than curbed it. Prisoners and prison personnel do not suffer a higher rate of criminal assault and homicide from life-term prisoners in abolition states than they do in death-penalty states. Between 1992 and 1995, 176 inmates were murdered by other prisoners. The vast majority of those inmates (84%) were killed in death penalty jurisdictions. During the same period, about 2% of all inmate assaults on prison staff were committed in abolition jurisdictions. Evidently, the threat of the death penalty ""does not even exert an incremental deterrent effect over the threat of a lesser punishment in the abolitionist states."" Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that prisoners sentenced to life without parole have equivalent rates of prison violence as compared to other inmates. Actual experience thus establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the death penalty does not deter murder. No comparable body of evidence contradicts that conclusion. Furthermore, there are documented cases in which the death penalty actually incited the capital crimes it was supposed to deter. These include instances of the so-called suicide-by-execution syndrome – persons who wanted to die but feared taking their own lives, and committed murder so that the state would kill them. For example, in 1996, , who suffered from mental illness, claimed that he killed a randomly-selected couple in a Georgia parking lot so that the state would kill him – he was sentenced to death and ultimately took his own life while on death row. Although inflicting the death penalty guarantees that the condemned person will commit no further crimes, it does not have a demonstrable deterrent effect on other individuals. Further, it is a high price to pay when studies show that few convicted murderers commit further crimes of violence. Researchers examined the prison and post-release records of 533 prisoners on death row in 1972 whose sentences were reduced to incarceration for life by the Supreme Court's ruling in Furman. This research showed that seven had committed another murder. But the same study showed that in four other cases, an innocent man had been sentenced to death. (Marquart and Sorensen, in Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review 1989) Recidivism among murderers does occasionally happen, but it occurs less frequently than most people believe; the media rarely distinguish between a convicted offender who murders while on parole, and a paroled murderer who murders again. Government data show that about one in 12 death row prisoners had a prior homicide conviction. But as there is no way to predict reliably which convicted murderers will try to kill again, the only way to prevent all such recidivism is to execute every convicted murderer – a policy no one seriously advocates. Equally effective but far less inhumane is a policy of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS UNFAIR Constitutional due process and elementary justice both require that the judicial functions of trial and sentencing be conducted with fundamental fairness, especially where the irreversible sanction of the death penalty is involved. In murder cases (since 1930, 88 percent of all executions have been for this crime), there has been substantial evidence to show that courts have sentenced some persons to prison while putting others to death in a manner that has been arbitrary, racially biased, and unfair. Racial Bias in Death Sentencing Racial discrimination was one of the grounds on which the Supreme Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in Furman. Half a century ago, in his classic American Dilemma (1944), Gunnar Myrdal reported that ""the South makes the widest application of the death penalty, and Negro criminals come in for much more than their share of the executions."" A study of the death penalty in Texas shows that the current capital punishment system is an outgrowth of the racist ""legacy of slavery."" Between 1930 and the end of 1996, 4,220 prisoners were executed in the United States; more than half (53%) were black. Our nation's death rows have always held a disproportionately large population of African Americans, relative to their percentage of the total population. Comparing black and white offenders over the past century, the former were often executed for what were considered less-than-capital offenses for whites, such as rape and burglary. (Between 1930 and 1976, 455 men were executed for rape, of whom 405 – 90 percent – were black.) A higher percentage of the blacks who were executed were juveniles; and the rate of execution without having one's conviction reviewed by any higher court was higher for blacks. (Bowers, Legal Homicide 1984; Streib, Death Penalty for Juveniles 1987) In recent years, it has been argued that such flagrant racial discrimination is a thing of the past. However, since the revival of the death penalty in the mid-1970s, about half of those on death row at any given time have been black. More striking is the racial comparison of victims. Although approximately 49% of all homicide victims are white, 77% of capital homicide cases since 1976 have involved a white victim. Between 1976 and 2005, 86% of white victims were killed by whites (14% by other races) while 94% of black victims were killed by blacks (6% by other races). Blacks and whites are murder victims in almost equal numbers of crimes – which is a very high percentage given that the general US population is 13% black. African-Americans are six times as likely as white Americans to die at the hands of a murderer, and roughly seven times as likely to murder someone. Young black men are fifteen times as likely to be murdered as young white men. So given this information, when those under death sentence are examined more closely, it turns out that race is a decisive factor after all. Further, studies like that commissioned by the Governor of Maryland found that “black offenders who kill white victims are at greater risk of a death sentence than others, primarily because they are substantially more likely to be charged by the state’s attorney with a capital offense.” The classic statistical study of racial discrimination in capital cases in Georgia presented in the McCleskey case showed that ""the average odds of receiving a death sentence among all indicted cases were 4.3 times higher in cases with white victims."" (David C. Baldus et al., Equal Justice and the Death Penalty 1990) In 1987 these data were placed before the Supreme Court in McCleskey v. Kemp and while the Court did not dispute the statistical evidence, it held that evidence of an overall pattern of racial bias was not sufficient. Mr. McCleskey would have to prove racial bias in his own case – a virtually impossible task. The Court also held that the evidence failed to show that there was ""a constitutionally significant risk of racial bias...."" (481 U.S. 279) Although the Supreme Court declared that the remedy sought by the plaintiff was ""best presented to the legislative bodies,"" subsequent efforts to persuade Congress to remedy the problem by enacting the Racial Justice Act were not successful. (Don Edwards & John Conyers, Jr., The Racial Justice Act – A Simple Matter of Justice, in University of Dayton Law Review 1995) In 1990, the U.S. General Accounting Office reported to the Congress the results of its review of empirical studies on racism and the death penalty. The GAO concluded: ""Our synthesis of the 28 studies shows a pattern of evidence indicating racial disparities in the charging, sentencing, and imposition of the death penalty after the Furman decision"" and that ""race of victim influence was found at all stages of the criminal justice system process..."" Texas was prepared to execute Duane Buck on September 15, 2011. Mr. Buck was condemned to death by a jury that had been told by an expert psychologist that he was more likely to be dangerous because he was African American. The Supreme Court stayed the case, but Mr. Buck has not yet received the new sentencing hearing justice requires. These results cannot be explained away by relevant non-racial factors, such as prior criminal record or type of crime, as these were factored for in the Baldus and GAO studies referred to above. They lead to a very unsavory conclusion: In the trial courts of this nation, even at the present time, the killing of a white person is treated much more severely than the killing of a black person. Of the 313 persons executed between January 1977 and the end of 1995, 36 had been convicted of killing a black person while 249 (80%) had killed a white person. Of the 178 white defendants executed, only three had been convicted of murdering people of color. Our criminal justice system essentially reserves the death penalty for murderers (regardless of their race) who kill white victims. Another recent Louisiana study found that defendants with white victims were 97% more likely to receive death sentences than defendants with black victims.[1] Both gender and socio-economic class also determine who receives a death sentence and who is executed. Women account for only two percent of all people sentenced to death, even though females commit about 11 percent of all criminal homicides. Many of the women under death sentence were guilty of killing men who had victimized them with years of violent abuse. Since 1900, only 51 women have been executed in the United States (15 of them black). Discrimination against the poor (and in our society, racial minorities are disproportionately poor) is also well established. It is a prominent factor in the availability of counsel. Fairness in capital cases requires, above all, competent counsel for the defendant. Yet ""approximately 90 percent of those on death row could not afford to hire a lawyer when they were tried."") Common characteristics of death-row defendants are poverty, the lack of firm social roots in the community, and inadequate legal representation at trial or on appeal. As Justice William O. Douglas noted in Furman, ""One searches our chronicles in vain for the execution of any member of the affluent strata in this society""(408 US 238). Failure of Safeguards The demonstrated inequities in the actual administration of capital punishment should tip the balance against it in the judgment of fair-minded and impartial observers. ""Whatever else might be said for the use of death as a punishment, one lesson is clear from experience: this is a power that we cannot exercise fairly and without discrimination.""(Gross and Mauro, Death and Discrimination 1989) Justice John Marshall Harlan, writing for the Court in Furman, noted ""… the history of capital punishment for homicides … reveals continual efforts, uniformly unsuccessful, to identify before the fact those homicides for which the slayer should die…. Those who have come to grips with the hard task of actually attempting to draft means of channeling capital sentencing discretion have confirmed the lesson taught by history…. To identify before the fact those characteristics of criminal homicides and their perpetrators which call for the death penalty, and to express these characteristics in language which can be fairly understood and applied by the sentencing authority, appear to be tasks which are beyond present human ability."" (402 U.S. 183 (1971)) Yet in the Gregg decision, the majority of the Supreme Court abandoned the wisdom of Justice Harlan and ruled as though the new guided-discretion statutes could accomplish the impossible. The truth is that death statutes approved by the Court ""do not effectively restrict the discretion of juries by any real standards, and they never will. No society is going to kill everybody who meets certain preset verbal requirements, put on the statute books without awareness of coverage of the infinity of special factors the real world can produce."" Evidence obtained by the Capital Jury Project has shown that jurors in capital trials generally do not understand the judge's instructions about the laws that govern the choice between imposing the death penalty and a life sentence. Even when they do comprehend, jurors often refuse to be guided by the law. ""Juror comprehension of the law… is mediocre. The effect [of this relative lack of comprehension of the law]… is to reduce the likelihood that capital defendants will benefit from the safeguards against arbitrariness built into the… law."" Even if the jury's sentencing decision were strictly governed by the relevant legal criteria, there remains a vast reservoir of unfettered discretion: the prosecutor's decision to prosecute for a capital or lesser crime, the court's willingness to accept or reject a guilty plea, the jury's decision to convict for second-degree murder or manslaughter rather than capital murder, the determination of the defendant's sanity, and the governor's final clemency decision, among others. Discretion in the criminal justice system is unavoidable. The history of capital punishment in America clearly demonstrates the social desire to mitigate the harshness of the death penalty by narrowing the scope of its application. Whether or not explicitly authorized by statutes, sentencing discretion has been the main vehicle to this end. But when sentencing discretion is used – as it too often has been – to doom the poor, the friendless, the uneducated, racial minorities, and the despised, it becomes injustice. Mindful of such facts, the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association (including 20 out of 24 former presidents of the ABA) called for a moratorium on all executions by a vote of 280 to 119 in February 1997. The House judged the current system to be ""a haphazard maze of unfair practices."" In its 1996 survey of the death penalty in the United States, the International Commission of Jurists reinforced this point. Despite the efforts made over the past two decades since Gregg to protect the administration of the death penalty from abuses, the actual ""constitutional errors committed in state courts have gravely undermined the legitimacy of the death penalty as a punishment for crime."" (International Commission of Jurists, Administration of the Death Penalty in the United States 1996) In 2009, the American Law Institute (ALI), the leading independent organization in the U.S. producing scholarly work to clarify, modernize and improve the law, removed capital punishment from its Model Penal Code. The ALI, which created the modern legal framework for the death penalty in 1962, indicated that the punishment is so arbitrary, fraught with racial and economic disparities, and unable to assure quality legal representation for indigent capital defendants, that it can never be administered fairly. Thoughtful citizens, who might possibly support the abstract notion of capital punishment, are obliged to condemn it in actual practice. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS IRREVERSIBLE Unlike any other criminal punishments, the death penalty is irrevocable. Speaking to the French Chamber of Deputies in 1830, years after having witnessed the excesses of the French Revolution, the Marquis de Lafayette said, ""I shall ask for the abolition of the punishment of death until I have the infallibility of human judgment demonstrated to me."" Although some proponents of capital punishment would argue that its merits are worth the occasional execution of innocent people, most would hasten to insist that there is little likelihood of the innocent being executed. Since 1900, in this country, there have been on the average more than four cases each year in which an entirely innocent person was convicted of murder. Scores of these individuals were sentenced to death. In many cases, a reprieve or commutation arrived just hours, or even minutes, before the scheduled execution. These erroneous convictions have occurred in virtually every jurisdiction from one end of the nation to the other. Nor have they declined in recent years, despite the new death penalty statutes approved by the Supreme Court. Disturbingly, and increasingly, a large body of evidence from the modern era shows that innocent people are often convicted of crimes – including capital crimes – and that some have been executed. In 2012, a new report in the Columbia Human Rights Law Review chronicled the horrifying case of Carlos DeLuna, a man executed in Texas in 1989 for a murder that it was “common knowledge” had been committed by another man. DeLuna’s story demonstrates so many of the factors that can go wrong in a capital case: faulty eyewitness identification, prosecutorial misconduct, police misconduct, a botched crime scene, destroyed DNA evidence, a poor person represented by ineffective by an ineffective inexperienced defense attorney overmatched by a professional prosecutor, and insufficient oversight from the bench.[3] In its case against DeLuna, the State presented no blood or DNA evidence, no crime scene fingerprints, and no proof of hair or fibers from the victim having been found on the defendant. He was convicted largely based on eyewitness testimony made from the back of a police car in a dimly lit lot near the crime scene. Meanwhile, a violent criminal named Carlos Hernandez—a man who not only shared DeLuna’s name, but also looked like him—repeatedly boasted about how he had committed the murder and gotten away with it. These disturbing facts about DeLuna’s case, brought to light more than two decades after his execution, refute the claim, made by some proponents of capital punishment, that the United States has never executed an innocent person. Consider this additional handful of cases of innocent people sentenced to die – some executed and some spared: This sample of freakish and arbitrary innocence determinations also speaks directly to the unceasing concern that there are many more innocent people on death rows across the country – as well as who have been executed. Several factors seen in the above sample of cases help explain why the judicial system cannot guarantee that justice will never miscarry: overzealous prosecution, mistaken or perjured testimony, race, faulty police work, coerced confessions, the defendant's previous criminal record, inept and under-resourced defense counsel, seemingly conclusive circumstantial evidence, and community pressure for a conviction, among others. And when the system does go wrong, it is often volunteers from outside the criminal justice system – journalists, for example – who rectify the errors, not the police or prosecutors. To retain the death penalty in the face of the demonstrable failures of the system is unacceptable, especially since there are no strong overriding reasons to favor the death penalty. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS BARBARIC Prisoners are executed in the United States by any one of five methods; in a few jurisdictions the prisoner is allowed to choose which one he or she prefers: The traditional mode of execution, hanging, is an option still available in Delaware, New Hampshire and Washington. Death on the gallows is easily bungled: If the drop is too short, there will be a slow and agonizing death by strangulation. If the drop is too long, the head will be torn off. Two states, Idaho and Utah, still authorize the firing squad. The prisoner is strapped into a chair and hooded. A target is pinned to the chest. Five marksmen, one with blanks, take aim and fire. Throughout the twentieth century, electrocution has been the most widely used form of execution in this country, and is still utilized in eleven states, although lethal injection is the primary method of execution. The condemned prisoner is led – or dragged – into the death chamber, strapped into the chair, and electrodes are fastened to head and legs. When the switch is thrown the body strains, jolting as the voltage is raised and lowered. Often smoke rises from the head. There is the awful odor of burning flesh. No one knows how long electrocuted individuals retain consciousness. In 1983, the electrocution of John Evans in Alabama was described by an eyewitness as follows: ""At 8:30 p.m. the first jolt of 1900 volts of electricity passed through Mr. Evans' body. It lasted thirty seconds. Sparks and flames erupted … from the electrode tied to Mr. Evans' left leg. His body slammed against the straps holding him in the electric chair and his fist clenched permanently. The electrode apparently burst from the strap holding it in place. A large puff of grayish smoke and sparks poured out from under the hood that covered Mr. Evans' face. An overpowering stench of burnt flesh and clothing began pervading the witness room. Two doctors examined Mr. Evans and declared that he was not dead. ""The electrode on the left leg was re-fastened. …Mr. Evans was administered a second thirty second jolt of electricity. The stench of burning flesh was nauseating. More smoke emanated from his leg and head. Again, the doctors examined Mr. Evans. [They] reported that his heart was still beating, and that he was still alive. At that time, I asked the prison commissioner, who was communicating on an open telephone line to Governor George Wallace, to grant clemency on the grounds that Mr. Evans was being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. The request …was denied. ""At 8:40 p.m., a third charge of electricity, thirty seconds in duration, was passed through Mr. Evans' body. At 8:44, the doctors pronounced him dead. The execution of John Evans took fourteen minutes."" Afterwards, officials were embarrassed by what one observer called the ""barbaric ritual."" The prison spokesman remarked, ""This was supposed to be a very clean manner of administering death."" The introduction of the gas chamber was an attempt to improve on electrocution. In this method of execution the prisoner is strapped into a chair with a container of sulfuric acid underneath. The chamber is sealed, and cyanide is dropped into the acid to form a lethal gas. Execution by suffocation in the lethal gas chamber has not been abolished but lethal injection serves as the primary method in states which still authorize it. In 1996 a panel of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California (where the gas chamber has been used since 1933) ruled that this method is a ""cruel and unusual punishment."" Here is an account of the 1992 execution in Arizona of Don Harding, as reported in the dissent by U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens: ""When the fumes enveloped Don's head he took a quick breath. A few seconds later he again looked in my direction. His face was red and contorted as if he were attempting to fight through tremendous pain. His mouth was pursed shut and his jaw was clenched tight. Don then took several more quick gulps of the fumes. ""At this point Don's body started convulsing violently.... His face and body turned a deep red and the veins in his temple and neck began to bulge until I thought they might explode. After about a minute Don's face leaned partially forward, but he was still conscious. Every few seconds he continued to gulp in. He was shuddering uncontrollably and his body was racked with spasms. His head continued to snap back. His hands were clenched. ""After several more minutes, the most violent of the convulsions subsided. At this time the muscles along Don's left arm and back began twitching in a wavelike motion under his skin. Spittle drooled from his mouth. ""Don did not stop moving for approximately eight minutes, and after that he continued to twitch and jerk for another minute. Approximately two minutes later, we were told by a prison official that the execution was complete. “Don Harding took ten minutes and thirty one seconds to die."" (Gomez v. U.S. District Court, 112 S.Ct. 1652) The latest mode of inflicting the death penalty, enacted into law by more than 30 states, is lethal injection, first used in 1982 in Texas. It is easy to overstate the humaneness and efficacy of this method; one cannot know whether lethal injection is really painless and there is evidence that it is not. As the U.S. Court of Appeals observed, there is ""substantial and uncontroverted evidence… that execution by lethal injection poses a serious risk of cruel, protracted death…. Even a slight error in dosage or administration can leave a prisoner conscious but paralyzed while dying, a sentient witness of his or her own asphyxiation."" (Chaney v. Heckler, 718 F.2d 1174, 1983). Its veneer of decency and subtle analogy with life-saving medical practice no doubt makes killing by lethal injection more acceptable to the public. Journalist Susan Blaustein, reacting to having witnessed an execution in Texas, comments: ""The lethal injection method … has turned dying into a still life, thereby enabling the state to kill without anyone involved feeling anything…. Any remaining glimmers of doubt – about whether the man received due process, about his guilt, about our right to take life – cause us to rationalize these deaths with such catchwords as ‘heinous,’ ‘deserved,’ ‘deterrent,’ ‘justice,’ and ‘painless.’ We have perfected the art of institutional killing to the degree that it has deadened our natural, quintessentially human response to death."" Botched Lethal Injections Nor does execution by lethal injection always proceed smoothly as planned. In 1985 ""the authorities repeatedly jabbed needles into … Stephen Morin, when they had trouble finding a usable vein because he had been a drug abuser."" In 1988, during the execution of Raymond Landry, ""a tube attached to a needle inside the inmate's right arm began leaking, sending the lethal mixture shooting across the death chamber toward witnesses."" Although the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the current method of lethal injection used is constitutional, several people have suffered because of this form of execution. In Ohio, Rommel Broom was subjected to 18 attempts at finding a vein so that he could be killed by lethal injection. The process to try to execute him took over two hours. Finally, the governor had to stop the execution and grant the inmate a one week reprieve. Mr. Broom has not been executed because he is challenging the state’s right to hold a second execution attempt. Nor was he the only Ohio inmate so maltreated. During his 2006 execution Joseph Clark screamed, “it don’t work” and requested to take something by mouth so the torture would end when his executioners took thirty minutes to find a vein. Christopher Newton’s execution took over two hours – so long that he had to be given a bathroom break. Lethal Injection Protocol Issues Most lethal injections in the United States use a “cocktail” consisting of three drugs that sequentially render an inmate unconscious, cause paralysis and cease breathing, and stop an inmate’s heart.[6] But in 2011, the sole American manufacturer of sodium thiopental, a vital part of the three-drug cocktail, decided to discontinue production, forcing states to adapt their lethal injection methodology.[7] Some states have replaced the three-drug cocktail with a single substance,[8] while others have replaced thiopental in the three-drug sequence with another anesthetic. Both three-drug and single-drug executions raise vital concerns: the three-drug cocktail’s paralyzing sedative may mask the inmate’s pain and suffering, while the single-drug method takes about 25 minutes to end a life (if there are no complications), compared with the ten-minute three-drug process.[10] Although the Supreme Court held in 2008 that Kentucky’s three-drug lethal injection procedure did not violate the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment,[11] it is unclear whether states’ adapted procedures pass muster. Indeed, in February 2012, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals admonished the Arizona Department of Corrections, stating that its approach to execution “cannot continue” and questioning the “regularity and reliability” of protocols that give complete discretion to the corrections director to determine which and how many drugs will be used for each execution.[12] In Georgia, the state Supreme Court stayed the execution of Warren Hill hours before he was scheduled to die in July 2012 in order to review the Department of Corrections’ new single-drug lethal injection procedure.[13] The Missouri Supreme Court imposed a temporary moratorium on executions in August 2012, declaring that it would be “premature” to set execution dates for death row inmates given a pending lawsuit about whether the state’s lethal injection procedures are humane. The state had amended its injection protocol to use a single drug, propofol, which advocates say causes severe pain upon injection.[14] Although similar suits are pending in other states,[15] not all protocol-based challenges have succeeded; in Texas and Oklahoma, executions have continued despite questions about the potential cruelty of lethal injection and the type or number of chemicals used.[16] Regardless of whether states use one or three drugs for an execution, all of the major lethal injection drugs are in short supply due to manufacturers’ efforts to prevent the use of their products for executions[17] and European Union restrictions on the exportation of drugs that may be used to kill.[18] As a result, some state executioners have pursued questionable means of obtaining the deadly chemicals from other states and foreign companies, including a pharmaceutical wholesaler operating out of the back of a London driving school.[19] These backroom deals—which, astoundingly, have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—are now the subject of federal litigation that could impact the legitimacy of the American death penalty system. In March 2012, six death row inmates argued that the FDA had shirked its duty to regulate lethal substances and raised concerns about the “very real risk that unapproved thiopental will not actually render a condemned prisoner unconscious.”[20] A federal district judge agreed and ordered the FDA to confiscate the imported thiopental, but the agency has appealed.[21] Witnessing the Execution Most people who have observed an execution are horrified and disgusted. ""I was ashamed,"" writes sociologist Richard Moran, who witnessed an execution in Texas in 1985. ""I was an intruder, the only member of the public who had trespassed on [the condemned man's] private moment of anguish. In my face he could see the horror of his own death."" Revulsion at the duty to supervise and witness executions is one reason why so many prison wardens – however unsentimental they are about crime and criminals – are opponents of capital punishment. Don Cabana, who supervised several executions in Missouri and Mississippi reflects on his mood just prior to witnessing an execution in the gas chamber: ""If [the condemned prisoner] was some awful monster deemed worthy of extermination, why did I feel so bad about it, I wondered. It has been said that men on death row are inhuman, cold-blooded killers. But as I stood and watched a grieving mother leave her son for the last time, I questioned how the sordid business of executions was supposed to be the great equalizer…. The 'last mile' seemed an eternity, every step a painful reminder of what waited at the end of the walk. Where was the cold-blooded murderer, I wondered, as we approached the door to the last-night cell. I had looked for that man before… and I still had not found him – I saw, in my grasp, only a frightened child. [Minutes after the execution and before] heading for the conference room and a waiting press corps, I… shook my head. 'No more. I don't want to do this anymore.'"" 1996) Recently, Allen Ault, former executioner for the State of Georgia, wrote, “The men and women who assist in executions are not psychopaths or sadists. They do their best to perform the impossible and inhumane job with which the state has charged them. Those of us who have participated in executions often suffer something very much like posttraumatic stress. Many turn to alcohol and drugs. For me, those nights that weren’t sleepless were plagued by nightmares.” For some individuals, however, executions seem to appeal to strange, aberrant impulses and provide an outlet for sadistic urges. Warden Lewis Lawes of Sing Sing Prison in New York wrote of the many requests he received to watch electrocutions, and told that when the job of executioner became vacant. ""I received more than seven hundred applications for the position, many of them offering cut-rate prices."" (Life and Death in Sing Sing 1928) Public executions were common in this country during the 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the last ones occurred in 1936 in Kentucky, when 20,000 people gathered to watch the hanging of a young African American male. (Teeters, in Journal of the Lancaster County Historical Society 1960) Delight in brutality, pain, violence and death may always be with us. But surely we must conclude that it is best for the law not to encourage such impulses. When the government sanctions, commands, and ceremoniously carries out the execution of a prisoner, it lends support to this destructive side of human nature. More than two centuries ago the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria, in his highly influential treatise On Crimes and Punishment (1764), asserted: ""The death penalty cannot be useful, because of the example of barbarity it gives men."" Beccaria's words still ring true – even if the death penalty were a ""useful"" deterrent, it would still be an ""example of barbarity."" No society can safely entrust the enforcement of its laws to torture, brutality, or killing. Such methods are inherently cruel and will always mock the attempt to cloak them in justice. As Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Goldberg wrote, ""The deliberate institutionalized taking of human life by the state is the greatest conceivable degradation to the dignity of the human personality.""(Boston Globe, August 16, 1976) Death Row Syndrome Capital appeals are not only costly; they are also time-consuming. The average death row inmate waits 12 years between sentencing and execution, and some sit in anticipation of their executions on death row for up to 30 years. For these prisoners, most of whom are housed in solitary confinement, this wait period may cause “Death Row Phenomenon” or “Death Row Syndrome.” Although the terms are often used interchangeably, “Death Row Phenomenon” refers to the destructive consequences of long-term solitary confinement[23] and the inevitable anxiety that results from awaiting one’s own death, while “Death Row Syndrome” refers to the severe psychological illness that often results from Death Row Phenomenon.[24] In solitary confinement, inmates are often isolated for 23 hours each day without access to training or educational programs, recreational activities, or regular visits. Such conditions have been demonstrated to provoke agitation, psychosis, delusions, paranoia, and self-destructive behavior.[25] To inflict this type of mental harm is inhumane, but it also may prove detrimental to public safety. When death row inmates successfully appeal their sentences, they are transferred into the general inmate population, and when death row inmates are exonerated, they are promptly released into the community.[26] Death Row Syndrome needlessly risks making these individuals dangerous to those around them. Neither Death Row Syndrome nor Death Row Phenomenon has received formal recognition from the American Psychiatric Association or the American Psychological Association.[27] In 1995, however, Justices Stevens and Breyer, in a memorandum regarding the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari to death row inmate Clarence Lackey, highlighted the “importance and novelty” of the question “whether executing a prisoner who has already spent some 17 years on death row violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.”[28] Further, as some scholars and advocates have noted, the mental deterioration symptomatic of Death Row Syndrome may render an inmate incompetent to participate in their own post-conviction proceedings.[29] Death Row Syndrome gained international recognition during the 1989 extradition proceedings of Jens Soering, a German citizen arrested in England and charged with committing murder on American soil.[30] Soering argued, and the European Court of Human Rights agreed, that extraditing him to the United States would violate Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.[31] The Court explained that, in the United States, “the condemned prisoner has to endure for many years the conditions on death row and the anguish and mounting tension of living in the ever-present shadow of death” such that extraditing Soering would violate protections against “inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”[32] Similar conclusions have been reached by the United Kingdom’s Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, and the Canadian Supreme Court.[33] CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS UNJUSTIFIED RETRIBUTION Justice, it is often insisted, requires the death penalty as the only suitable retribution for heinous crimes. This claim does not bear scrutiny, however. By its nature, all punishment is retributive. Therefore, whatever legitimacy is to be found in punishment as just retribution can, in principle, be satisfied without recourse to executions. Moreover, the death penalty could be defended on narrowly retributive grounds only for the crime of murder, and not for any of the many other crimes that have frequently been made subject to this mode of punishment (rape, kidnapping, espionage, treason, drug trafficking). Few defenders of the death penalty are willing to confine themselves consistently to the narrow scope afforded by retribution. In any case, execution is more than a punishment exacted in retribution for the taking of a life. As Nobel Laureate Albert Camus wrote, ""For there to be equivalence, the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who, from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months. Such a monster is not encountered in private life."" (Reflections on the Guillotine, in Resistance, Rebellion, and Death 1960) It is also often argued that death is what murderers deserve, and that those who oppose the death penalty violate the fundamental principle that criminals should be punished according to their just desserts – ""making the punishment fit the crime."" If this rule means punishments are unjust unless they are like the crime itself, then the principle is unacceptable: It would require us to rape rapists, torture torturers, and inflict other horrible and degrading punishments on offenders. It would require us to betray traitors and kill multiple murderers again and again – punishments that are, of course, impossible to inflict. Since we cannot reasonably aim to punish all crimes according to this principle, it is arbitrary to invoke it as a requirement of justice in the punishment of murder. If, however, the principle of just deserts means the severity of punishments must be proportional to the gravity of the crime – and since murder is the gravest crime, it deserves the severest punishment – then the principle is no doubt sound. Nevertheless, this premise does not compel support for the death penalty; what it does require is that other crimes be punished with terms of imprisonment or other deprivations less severe than those used in the punishment of murder. Criminals no doubt deserve to be punished, and the severity of the punishment should be appropriate to their culpability and the harm they have caused the innocent. But severity of punishment has its limits – imposed by both justice and our common human dignity. Governments that respect these limits do not use premeditated, violent homicide as an instrument of social policy. Murder Victims Families Oppose the Death Penalty Some people who have lost a loved one to murder believe that they cannot rest until the murderer is executed. But this sentiment is by no means universal. Coretta Scott King has observed, ""As one whose husband and mother-in-law have died the victims of murder and assassination, I stand firmly and unequivocally opposed to the death penalty for those convicted of capital offenses. An evil deed is not redeemed by an evil deed of retaliation. Justice is never advanced in the taking of a human life. Morality is never upheld by a legalized murder."" (Speech to National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, Washington, D.C., September 26, 1981) Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, daughter of the slain Senator Robert Kennedy, has written: ""I was eight years old when my father was murdered. It is almost impossible to describe the pain of losing a parent to a senseless murder.…But even as a child one thing was clear to me: I didn't want the killer, in turn, to be killed. I remember lying in bed and praying, 'Please, God. Please don't take his life too.' I saw nothing that could be accomplished in the loss of one life being answered with the loss of another. And I knew, far too vividly, the anguish that would spread through another family – another set of parents, children, brothers, and sisters thrown into grief.""(Foreword to Gray and Stanley, A Punishment in Search of A Crime 1989) Across the nation, many who have survived the murder of a loved one have joined Murder Victims' Families for Reconciliation or Murder Victims Families for Human Rights, in the effort to replace anger and hate toward the criminal with a restorative approach to both the offender and the bereaved survivors. Groups of murder victims family members have supported campaigns for abolition of the death penalty in Illinois, Connecticut, Montana and Maryland most recently. Barbara Anderson Young, the sister of James Anderson, who was allegedly run over by a white teenager in Mississippi in 2011, who reportedly wanted to hurt him because he was Black, wrote a letter to the local prosecutor on behalf of their family indicating the family’s opposition to the death penalty, which is “deeply rooted in our religious faith, a faith that was central in James’ life as well.” The letter also eloquently asks that the defendant be spared execution because the death penalty “historically has been used in Mississippi and the South primarily against people of color for killing whites.” It continues, “[e]xecuting James' killers will not help balance the scales. But sparing them may help to spark a dialogue that one day will lead to the elimination of capital punishment."" Lawrence Brewer, convicted of the notorious dragging death of James Byrd in Texas, was executed in 2011. Members of Mr. Byrd’s family opposed the death penalty, despite the racist and vicious nature of the killing. Of Brewer’s remorseless – he said he had no regrets the day he was executed – Byrd’s sister, Betty Boatner, said, “If I could say something to him, I would let him know that I forgive him and then if he still has no remorse, I just feel sorry for him.” Byrd’s daughter shared that she didn’t want Brewer to die because “it’s easy . . .(a)ll he’s going to do it go to sleep” rather than live every day with what he did and perhaps one day recognize the humanity of his victim. James Byrd’s son, Ross, points out ""You can't fight murder with murder . . .(l)ife in prison would have been fine. I know he can't hurt my daddy anymore. I wish the state would take in mind that this isn't what we want."" CAPITAL PUNISHMENT COSTS MORE THAN INCARCERATION It is sometimes suggested that abolishing capital punishment is unfair to the taxpayer, on the assumption that life imprisonment is more expensive than execution. If one takes into account all the relevant costs, however, just the reverse is true. ""The death penalty is not now, nor has it ever been, a more economical alternative to life imprisonment."") A murder trial normally takes much longer when the death penalty is at issue than when it is not. Litigation costs – including the time of judges, prosecutors, public defenders, and court reporters, and the high costs of briefs – are mostly borne by the taxpayer. The extra costs of separate death row housing and additional security in court and elsewhere also add to the cost. A 1982 study showed that were the death penalty to be reintroduced in New York, the cost of the capital trial alone would be more than double the cost of a life term in prison. (N.Y. State Defenders Assn., ""Capital Losses"" 1982) The death penalty was eventually reintroduced in New York and then found unconstitutional and not reintroduced again, in part because of cost. In Maryland, a comparison of capital trial costs with and without the death penalty for the years concluded that a death penalty case costs ""approximately 42 percent more than a case resulting in a non-death sentence."" In 1988 and 1989 the Kansas legislature voted against reinstating the death penalty after it was informed that reintroduction would involve a first-year cost of more than $11 million.59 Florida, with one of the nation's most populous death rows, has estimated that the true cost of each execution is approximately $3.2 million, or approximately six times the cost of a life-imprisonment sentence."" (David von Drehle, ""Capital Punishment in Paralysis,"" Miami Herald, July 10, 1988) A 1993 study of the costs of North Carolina's capital punishment system revealed that litigating a murder case from start to finish adds an extra $163,000 to what it would cost the state to keep the convicted offender in prison for 20 years. The extra cost goes up to $216,000 per case when all first-degree murder trials and their appeals are considered, many of which do not end with a death sentence and an execution. In 2011 in California, a broad coalition of organizations called Taxpayers for Justice put repeal of the death penalty on the ballot for 2012 in part because of the high cost documented by a recent study that found the state has already spent $4 billion on capital punishment resulting in 13 executions. The group includes over 100 law enforcement leaders, in addition to crime-victim advocates and exonerated individuals. Among them is former Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti, whose office pursued dozens of capital cases during his 32 years as a prosecutor. He said, ""My frustration is more about the fact that the death penalty does not serve any useful purpose and it's very expensive."" Don Heller, a Republican and former prosecutor, wrote ""I am convinced that at least one innocent person may have been executed under the current death penalty law. It was not my intent nor do I believe that of the voters who overwhelmingly enacted the death penalty law in 1978. We did not consider that horrific possibility."" Heller emphasized that he is not ""soft on crime,"" but that ""life without parole protects public safety better than a death sentence."" Additionally, he said the money spent on the death penalty could be better used elsewhere, as California cuts funding for police officers and prosecutors. ""Paradoxically, the cost of capital punishment takes away funds that could be used to enhance public safety.""[34] From one end of the country to the other public officials decry the additional cost of capital cases even when they support the death penalty system. ""Wherever the death penalty is in place, it siphons off resources which could be going to the front line in the war against crime…. Politicians could address this crisis, but, for the most part they either endorse executions or remain silent."" The only way to make the death penalty more ""cost effective"" than imprisonment is to weaken due process and curtail appellate review, which are the defendant's (and society's) only protection against the most aberrant miscarriages of justice. Any savings in dollars would, of course, be at the cost of justice: In nearly half of the death-penalty cases given review under federal habeas corpus provisions, the murder conviction or death sentence was overturned. In 1996, in response to public clamor for accelerating executions, Congress imposed severe restrictions on access to federal habeas corpus and also ended all funding of the regional death penalty ""resource centers"" charged with providing counsel on appeal in the federal courts. (Carol Castenada, ""Death Penalty Centers Losing Support Funds,"" USA Today, Oct. 24, 1995) These restrictions virtually guarantee that the number and variety of wrongful murder convictions and death sentences will increase. The savings in time and money will prove to be illusory. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS LESS POPULAR THAN THE ALTERNATIVES It is commonly reported that the American public overwhelmingly approves of the death penalty. More careful analysis of public attitudes, however, reveals that most Americans prefer an alternative; they would oppose the death penalty if convicted murderers were sentenced to life without parole and were required to make some form of financial restitution. In 2010, when California voters were asked which sentence they preferred for a first-degree murderer, 42% of registered voters said they preferred life without parole and 41% said they preferred the death penalty. In 2000, when voters were asked the same question, 37% chose life without parole while 44% chose the death penalty. A 1993 nationwide survey revealed that although 77% of the public approves of the death penalty, support drops to 56% if the alternative is punishment with no parole eligibility until 25 years in prison. Support drops even further, to 49%, if the alternative is no parole under any conditions. And if the alternative is no parole plus restitution, it drops still further, to 41%. Only a minority of the American public would favor the death penalty if offered such alternatives. INTERNATIONALLY, CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS WIDELY VIEWED AS INHUMANE AND ANACHRONISTIC An international perspective on the death penalty helps us understand the peculiarity of its use in the United States. As long ago as 1962, it was reported to the Council of Europe that ""the facts clearly show that the death penalty is regarded in Europe as something of an anachronism…."" 1962) Today, either by law or in practice, all of Western Europe has abolished the death penalty. In Great Britain, it was abolished (except for cases of treason) in 1971; France abolished it in 1981. Canada abolished it in 1976. The United Nations General Assembly affirmed in a formal resolution that throughout the world, it is desirable to ""progressively restrict the number of offenses for which the death penalty might be imposed, with a view to the desirability of abolishing this punishment."" By mid-1995, eighteen countries had ratified the Sixth Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, outlawing the death penalty in peacetime. Underscoring worldwide support for abolition was the action of the South African constitutional court in 1995, barring the death penalty as an ""inhumane"" punishment. Between 1989 and 1995, two dozen other countries abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Since 1995, 43 more abolished it. All told, 71% of the world’s nation’s have abolished the death penalty in law or practice; only 58 of 197 retain it. International Law A look at international trends and agreements sheds light on the peculiarity of the United States’ continued imposition of capital punishment. Today, over 140 nations have abolished the death penalty either by law or in practice and, of the 58 countries that have retained the death penalty, only 21 carried out known executions in 2011.[35] Furthermore, capital punishment has compelled the United States to abstain from signing or ratifying several major international treaties and perhaps to violate international agreements to which it is a party: In 1989, the General Assembly adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), one of the UN’s primary human rights treaties.[36] Parties to the Protocol must take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty and protect their citizens’ right not to be executed, although signatories may reserve the right to apply the death penalty for serious military criminals during wartime.[37] The United States has yet to join the 35 signatories or 75 parties to the Protocol, trailing behind the world’s leading democracies in the protection of human rights. Although the Second Protocol to the ICCPR is the only worldwide instrument calling for death penalty abolition, there are three such instruments with regional emphases. Adopted by the Council of Europe in 1982 and ratified by eighteen nations by mid-1995, the Sixth Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) provides for the abolition of capital punishment during peacetime.In 2002, the Council adopted the Thirteenth Protocol to the ECHR, which provides for the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances, including times of war or imminent threat of war. In 1990, the Organization of American States adopted the Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty, which provides for total abolition but allows states to reserve the right to apply the death penalty during wartime.[38] The United States has ratified the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR), an international treaty setting forth a framework for consular relations among independent countries. Under Article 36 of the VCCR, local authorities are obligated to inform all detained foreigners “without delay” of their right to request consular notification of their detention and their right to demand and access opportunities to communicate with their consular representatives. Local authorities have repeatedly disregarded this obligation, resulting in the International Court of Justice holding in 2004 that states had violated the VCCR by failing to inform 51 named Mexican nationals of their rights. All 51 were sentenced to death. When the State of Texas refused to honor this judgment and provide relief for the 15 death-row inmates whose VCCR rights it had violated, President George W. Bush sought to intervene on the prisoners’ behalf, taking the case to the United States Supreme Court. The Court denied the President’s appeal, and Texas has gone on to execute inmates whose VCCR rights it had failed to honor. In 1994, the United States signed the United Nations (UN) Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT).[40] The treaty, which has now been ratified or signed by 176 nations, outlaws the imposition of physical or psychological abuse on people in detention. While it does not explicitly prohibit capital punishment, the treaty does forbid the intentional infliction of pain. Since 1976, however, more than 20 executions in the United States have involved prolonged, painful, or shocking errors, such as an inmate’s head catching fire or a lengthy and torturous search for a vein suitable for lethal injection. Additionally, accidents aside, our methods of execution—lethal injection, electrocution, firing squad, gas chamber, and hanging—may be inherently painful. The CAT also forbids the infliction of pain and suffering “based on discrimination of any kind,” [41] yet racial inequality is endemic to our death rows. Also in 1994, the United States ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), a treaty intended to protect against racial discrimination, whether intentional or resulting from seemingly neutral state policies. To meet its obligations as a party to ICERD, the United States must take steps to review and amend policies and procedures that create or perpetuate racial discrimination, including capital punishment.[42] Once in use everywhere and for a wide variety of crimes, the death penalty today is generally forbidden by law and widely abandoned in practice, in most countries outside the United States. Indeed, the unmistakable worldwide trend is toward the complete abolition of capital punishment. In the United States, opposition to the death penalty is widespread and diverse. Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant religious groups are among the more than 50 national organizations that constitute the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. The Case Against the Death Penalty was first published by the ACLU as a pamphlet in 1973. The original text was written by Hugo Adam Bedau, Ph.D., who also contributed to several subsequent editions of the pamphlet. This version was most recently revised by the ACLU in 2012. [1] Glenn L.

" The Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller investigated whether a Trump adviser was part of an Egyptian plan, proven, to funnel $10 million to the 2016 Trump campaign.","Alongside the Trump-Russia Inquiry, a Lesser-Known Look at Egyptian Influence  Trump’s Legal Troubles ADVERTISEMENT  The Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller investigated whether a Trump adviser was part of an Egyptian plan, never proven, to funnel $10 million to the 2016 Trump campaign. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Michael S. SchmidtAdam Goldman and Glenn Thrush In the summer of 2017, as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was starting his investigation, his agents and prosecutors were chasing potentially explosive allegations about foreign influence over Donald J. Trump and his campaign. C.I.A. intelligence relayed to the special counsel’s office suggested that senior leaders of a foreign power had signed off on secretly funneling millions of dollars — with the help of a Trump campaign adviser acting as “a bag man” — to Mr. Trump in the final days of the 2016 election. Interviews and other evidence obtained by the special counsel’s office showed that indeed Mr. Trump had lent his campaign a similar amount of money in the final days of the race — and, after beating Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump immediately struck a far more favorable tone toward the country than his predecessors. The country in question, however, was not Russia. It was Egypt. Seven years after Mr. Mueller’s team dug in on those allegations, people familiar with the investigation acknowledged that while much of the country’s attention was focused on ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, the most concrete lead Mr. Mueller’s team initially had about potential foreign influence over Mr. Trump involved Egypt. The people familiar with the inquiry discussed details of it on the condition of anonymity. ADVERTISEMENT While Mr. Mueller has often been criticized for not moving aggressively enough to investigate Mr. Trump’s personal and financial ties to Russia, his team took invasive steps to try to understand whether Mr. Trump or his campaign had received financial backing from Cairo. Mr. Trump’s foreign business ties and efforts by foreign interests and government to influence him have come under scrutiny again as he seeks to return to the White House. The little-known investigation into possible Egyptian influence shows both the intensity of past efforts to explore the issue and how they have fueled Mr. Trump’s long-running assertions that he has been subject to a “witch hunt.” Case Tracker: Trump is facing multiple criminal cases related to his business and political activities.

Trump on Trial Newsletter: Sign up here to get the latest news and analysis on the cases in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C. The Egypt investigation would outlast Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, which shut down in 2019. It was picked up by career prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, who closed it out in the summer of 2020 without pursuing any charges. No evidence has ever surfaced publicly that Mr. Trump or his campaign directly received Egyptian money. Details about the depth and breadth of the investigation have trickled out over the years. CNN laid out major elements of the investigation in October 2020, including that there was a secret legal fight between the Justice Department and an Egyptian bank. Investigators at the time were seeking bank records related to the matter, which ultimately ended up — under seal — being appealed to the Supreme Court. The Washington Post on Friday disclosed further details, reporting that five days before Mr. Trump took office in 2017 an organization linked to Egyptian intelligence withdrew $10 million in cash from a bank in Cairo — the same amount that the C.I.A. had been told was given to Mr. Trump in the final days of his campaign. The report about the withdrawal was confirmed to The New York Times by a person briefed on the investigation. ADVERTISEMENT The investigation started in the days after the 2016 election when the C.I.A. learned from a trusted confidential source that senior Egyptian leaders — including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi — had signed off on sending $10 million to Mr. Trump’s cash strapped campaign. The Egyptian leaders, investigators would be told, had in mind someone in Mr. Trump’s orbit to move the money: a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser named Walid Phares, who had frequently appeared on Fox News. Our politics reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. That includes participating in rallies and donating money to a candidate or cause. The F.B.I. opened an investigation into Mr. Phares, with investigators trying to understand whether he was “a bag man.” Mr. Trump’s first C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, was briefed on the details of the agency’s intelligence. In May 2017, Mr. Mueller was appointed special counsel after questions were raised about Mr. Trump’s attempts to interfere in F.B.I. investigations into his ties to Russia. Mr. Mueller was given a mandate to investigate Russia’s effort to influence the 2016 election and ties that four Trump campaign advisers had to Russia. What the public did not know at the time was that Mr. Mueller had also been given the job of investigating Mr. Phares and the intelligence suggesting that Egypt had sought to funnel money to Mr. Trump. ADVERTISEMENT Throughout the investigation, Mr. Mueller’s team was confronted with a range of allegations about Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. But, in the eyes of some agents and prosecutors working on Mr. Mueller’s team, the intelligence about Egypt was far firmer than anything they had related to Mr. Trump and Russia. At the time, Mr. Trump was threatening to fire Mr. Mueller, drawing a red line around his personal finances. But the evidence about Egypt allowed agents and prosecutors to convince Mr. Mueller to subpoena Mr. Trump’s bank records from the period of time during the campaign and just after the election that he might have received the money. The records were not helpful in corroborating the allegations, the people familiar with the investigation said. Some investigators wanted to continue digging, but Mr. Mueller stopped short of seeking the records from when Mr. Trump took office, leaving some investigators disappointed. Mr. Mueller’s investigators did devote significant resources to looking at Mr. Phares, who had told Trump campaign advisers that he could broker meetings between the Egyptian government and the campaign. Mr. Phares also took credit for arranging a September 2016 meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. el-Sisi, which investigators later examined. ADVERTISEMENT American intelligence agencies had learned what agents and analysts thought was potentially corroborating evidence: that there were questions atop the Egyptian government whether Mr. Phares could be trusted to deliver the money. The F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Phares on multiple occasions, learning new details such as his contacts with Egyptian intelligence officials. But despite Mr. Phares initial cooperation with the investigators, he eventually hired a lawyer and stopped talking. By 2019, Mr. Mueller’s team thought it had taken the investigation as far as it could. When Mr. Mueller’s Russia inquiry wound down, he referred the still-open Egyptian case to Justice Department prosecutors, who picked up where he left off. It was around that same time that U.S. officials learned of the $10 million bank withdrawal in Cairo by the group linked to Egyptian intelligence agencies, sparking more suspicions among investigators. In June 2020, The Times reported that the F.B.I. and special counsel’s office had investigated whether Mr. Phares had secretly worked for the Egyptian government to try to influence the incoming Trump administration. Mr. Phares declined to comment at the time and could not be reached on Friday. But that summer, prosecutors decided they had hit a wall and closed out the case. Michael S.

"""American family denied entry to Taylor Swift concert for the worst reason""","Freed American’s family to miss Taylor Swift concert for the very best reason    By Jennifer Hansler, CNN (CNN) — Miriam Butorin was supposed to attend Taylor Swift’s concert on Friday for her 13th birthday. She is missing it, but for the very best reason. Miriam’s mother, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, was released Thursday from Russian detention in a historic prisoner swap. The release of the 47-year-old journalist for the US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty was part of a complex prisoner swap between Russia, the US and other Western nations involving 24 detainees in total, including fellow freed Americans Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. Kurmasheva had been detained in October 2023 and found guilty of spreading false information about the Russian army – charges her family and employer deny. Kurmasheva’s family joined President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday, where he shared the news that she was on her way back to the United States. There, the president led the crowd in singing happy birthday to Miriam. Minutes before midnight, in an incredibly emotional scene, she was reunited with her mother on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Kurmasheva was the final freed American to emerge from the aircraft that touched down late Thursday. She hugged Biden and the president pressed his forehead to hers. Kurmasheva also greeted Vice President Kamala Harris before running to her daughters and husband. When CNN spoke with Kurmasheva’s family in mid-July, her husband, Pavel Butorin, had mentioned the concert tickets. “We were so confident that she would get back to us that I bought Taylor Swift tickets…in June or July…for August 2024,” Butorin said at the time. “Little did we know that she would be arrested and taken away from us.” Just a matter of weeks ago, there was little sign of Kurmasheva being released from Russian detention – and of the family being able to attend the concert in Warsaw together. Even though they are missing Friday’s concert, Butorin expressed confidence the family would still get to go to a Swift concert in the future. Thursday, he said, was an incredible day.

"""Trump rally shooter's roof was unmonitored by Secret Service, claims acting director""","Acting Secret Service director says he’s ‘ashamed’ after the Trump assassination attempt   Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe says what he saw at the Pennsylvania site where a gunman fired at former President Donald Trump made him “ashamed.”             WASHINGTON (AP) — The Secret Service’s acting director told lawmakers Tuesday that he considered it indefensible that the roof used by the gunman in the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was unsecured and said it was regrettable that local law enforcement had not alerted his agency before the shooting that an armed subject had been spotted on a nearby roof. Ronald Rowe Jr. also testified that he recently visited the shooting site and laid down on the roof of the building where shots were fired in order to evaluate the gunman’s line of sight during the July 13 shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. “What I saw made me ashamed. As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,” he said. The testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency’s mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not receiving information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been seen on the roof of a building less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking. “Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president’s security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,” Rowe said. “It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.” He said that the shooting amounted to a “failure on multiple levels,” including a failure of imagination and a “failure to challenge our assumptions.”  “We assumed that the state and locals had it,” Rowe said. “We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams” in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots. “And I can assure you,” Rowe added, “that we’re not going to make that mistake again.” He said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs, dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating. He said he’s also directed that federal and local counter snipers work together on roofs. Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. The blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics. Tuesday’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting. What to know about the 2024 Election Local law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated. Even though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man. “No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,” Rowe said. At another point, he noted, “It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn’t know that there was this incident going on.” But Rowe’s willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility. “Isn’t the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded — isn’t that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?” said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. Rowe, raising his voice, responded that he has “lost sleep over this for the last 17 days” and that he would not be rushed “to judgment” by Congress. He assured lawmakers that “people will be held accountable.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, “a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.” He added: “Nothing’s going to change until somebody loses their job.” The FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school. Abbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021. The chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks’s presence on that platform was consistent with being “pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden’s immigration policy.” On Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico. The FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",False,True,False

"""Trump plans to impose taxes on Social Security benefits. Here's what that could mean for seniors.""","Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security income is a ‘fatal mistake,’ lawmaker says. What that could mean for benefits                                                                                                                      Former President Donald Trump has touted a bold new idea for Social Security: ending taxes on benefit income. “Seniors should not pay tax on Social Security,” Trump wrote on July 31 in all capital letters on social media platform Truth Social, and repeated the point during an Aug. 7 Fox & Friends interview. While the change would let beneficiaries keep more of their monthly checks, Trump’s plan has a “fatal mistake” in that it doesn’t make up for the revenue that would be lost, Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., told CNBC.com in an exclusive interview. More from Personal Finance: Social Security cost-of-living adjustment may be 2.6% in 2025 Record backlog leads to $1.1 billion in improper Social Security payments How retirement ‘super savers’ amass the biggest 401(k) balances “He comes out and says he’s going to have a tax break but doesn’t say how he’s going to pay for that,” said Larson, who is ranking member of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security. “In essence, his proposal would end up cutting the Social Security trust fund.” On Wednesday, Social Security reached the 89th anniversary since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the program into law. The program now faces an uncertain future, as its combined trust funds are projected to run dry in 2035. At that time, unless Congress acts sooner, beneficiaries may see an across-the-board 17% benefit cut. The program’s trust fund that pays retirement benefits is due to run out even sooner, in 2033, risking a 21% cut to those benefits. Social Security’s future is “one of the top” or a “very important” issue in how voters plan to choose candidates in the November presidential election, a new CNBC poll finds. “I believe, from my conversations with lots of people on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill, that there’s the will to actually examine this and extend it for many, many years to come,” Social Security Commissioner Martin O’Malley told CNBC “Squawk Box” on Wednesday. Trump is not the first to suggest the elimination of taxes on Social Security benefits. One Democratic bill introduced in January in the House of Representatives — the You Earned It, You Keep It Act — likewise calls for excluding Social Security benefits from gross income for federal income taxes. If enacted, the bill would save the typical senior household almost $560 per year, the Senior Citizens League, a non-partisan senior group, recently estimated. But the move would increase federal deficits by $1.6 trillion to $1.8 trillion through 2035, non-partisan public policy organization Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, found in a recent analysis of Trump’s idea. Moreover, it would increase Social Security’s 75-year shortfall by 25%. A Trump campaign spokesman did not return a request for comment by CNBC. Larson is instead touting a broader reform package — the Social Security 2100 Act — that would broadly make benefits more generous and pay for those increases by imposing higher taxes on the wealthy. The bill would include a 2% across-the-board benefit increase, as well as more targeted increases for lower-income seniors, widows and widowers and students. The proposal would also eliminate current rules that result in reduced benefits tied to public servants, known as the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset. To pay for those changes, the bill calls for raising the Social Security payroll tax thresholds for wealthy earners. In 2024, up to $168,600 in earnings are subject to those levies. The bill calls for reapplying the tax on earnings over $400,000. It would also apply a higher net investment income tax rate for those higher earners. Altogether, the bill’s provisions could help extend the program’s ability to pay full benefits by 32 years, the Social Security Office of the Chief Actuary estimated last year. The Social Security 2100 bill has been reintroduced in various sessions of Congress. Larson, who is running for reelection, said he plans to reintroduce it again in the next session. While the current version has 188 Democratic co-sponsors, Larson said he hopes for the backing of two other notable leaders — Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz. As senator, Harris was a co-sponsor of a bill that similarly called for making benefits more generous while raising taxes for the wealthy. As vice president, the White House administration likewise called for expanding Social Security and taxing the wealthy. Meanwhile, Walz was an original co-sponsor of Social Security 2100 during his time as a congressman representing Minnesota, according to Larson. As governor of Minnesota, Walz increased the state tax exemption for Social Security benefits. The Harris-Walz campaign did not return a request for comment from CNBC. While Republicans have considered other changes to Social Security — such as raising the retirement age — Larson hopes he can eventually lure leaders from the other side of the aisle to support his proposal. “We’re going to lift the cap on people [earning] over $400,000 and the other side says, ‘Here you go again. It’s tax the wealthy,’” Larson said. “No, it’s have them pay their fair share.” In congressional hearings on the program, Republican lawmakers have raised concerns about the costs associated with reforming the program. Ultimately, restoring Social Security’s solvency may require a compromise including both tax increases and benefit cuts. Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, commended Larson for his passion and for putting a proposal on paper during an April Ways and Means Social Security subcommittee hearing. “Even if I disagree, and in some cases wildly disagree, with his way of solving it, we’re going to have to get in a room and we’re going to have to hold hands and leap off the cliff of those who criticize us who do anything to reform the program,” Arrington said. While critics question whether lawmakers will bring the bill forward for a vote, Larson said he hopes to see progress on Social Security in the next Congress or in the coming lame duck session.

"""Yogi's Govt Bill Faces Backlash from Senior UP BJP Leaders, Causing Political Turmoil""","Decode Politics: How a Yogi govt Bill ran into a wall raised by senior UP BJP leaders  In another attempt to project a united front in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP ensured that both its Deputy Chief Ministers in the state were present alongside CM Yogi Adityanath at the Legislature Party meeting convened before the start of the Monsoon Session of the Assembly this week. Days later, that front is again showing cracks. First, the Adityanath government’s Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilization for Public Purposes) Bill ran into objections from the BJP’s own ranks in the Assembly, with City West, Prayagraj, MLA and former minister Sidharth Nath Singh and Prayagraj MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai expressing apprehensions over the legislation. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna even intervened while Bajpai was speaking to appeal: “Aap samajh nahi rahe ho. Pahle padh toh lo (You do not understand the Bill. First, go through it carefully).” BJP ally NISHAD Party’s Anil Tripathi then joined Singh and Bajpai in expressing his misgivings. Then, a day after the Bill cleared the Assembly, the Legislative Council sent it to a Select Committee for further scrutiny. The demand was first made by UP BJP chief and MLC Bhupendra Chaudhary, and supported by Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, who has launched a covert rebellion against Adityanath. While Adityanath in his capacity as CM is the Leader of the BJP in the Assembly, Maurya is the leader of the BJP in the Council. The BJP and allies enjoy a clear majority in both the Houses, which means that it is rare for a Bill to be sent to a Select Committee, that too on a demand made from the Treasury Benches. Nazul land is land originally acquired during the colonial period for specific purposes such as public utilities, administrative functions or for the settlement of displaced individuals. Over time, this land has been used or leased for various public and private purposes. As per the proposed Bill, Nazul land in the state will now be reserved and used exclusively for public purposes. Any court proceedings or applications requesting the transfer of ownership of Nazul land to private individuals or institutions will be cancelled and automatically rejected. In case payments have been made in anticipation of such ownership changes, the amounts are to be refunded. The government could choose to extend the leases of current leaseholders of Nazul land, provided they are in good standing, regularly paying rent, and have not violated lease terms. While BJP leaders as well as the Opposition say they have raised objections to the Bill in “public interest”, the legislation in fact replaces an ordinance that has been in implementation since March this year. The ordinance did not see any significant opposition when it was passed by the Adityanath Cabinet. On Thursday, when Chaudhary proposed that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee, even Opposition members were initially caught off-guard, not knowing how to respond. Even as the latter neither backed nor opposed Chaudhary’s proposal, other BJP leaders expressed their support for Chaudhary, with Maurya indicating it by raising his hand. The other Deputy CM, Brajesh Pathak, was seated next to Maurya in his capacity as minister. He could not vote on the proposal as he is a member of the Assembly and not the Council, but as soon as the decision was taken to send the Bill to the Select Committee, Pathak and Maurya were seen shaking hands. While the Bill saw a discussion in the Assembly on July 31, before it was passed by a voice vote, there was no discussion on it in the Upper House on August 1 before it was sent to the Select Committee. In the Assembly, noting that “governments work in continuation”, Sidharth Nath Singh suggested that those who have been residing on such land for ages and near the end of their lease should be given the opportunity to get an extension. He also suggested that with previous governments alternatively allowing freehold of the land or stopping it, those who continued to pay their instalments after freehold should also be considered. The Indian Express spoke to some members of the Legislative Council, where the Bill saw no discussion. They admitted they had not read the Bill, but added that they knew it would be recommended for Select Committee appraisal as “the public is against the provisions of the Bill”. They could not say what these provisions were. A BJP MLC said: “When the organisational head makes a proposal, we have to follow. He (Chaudhary) is not just a member of the Council but also the head of the state organisation. Even the Leader of our House and Deputy CM Keshav ji supported it. Many people have been approaching us against the provisions as it would displace poor people who have been residing on Nuzul lands for generations… The new law would have given the government the power to take it back at will.” Asked why they did not object when the ordinance was moved, the BJP MLC said he “did not know about that”. “We had to support sending it to the Select Committee, and we did.” About the surprisingly vociferous intervention by BJP MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai on the matter, Prayagraj Mahanagar BJP president Rajendra Mishra said: “Harshvardhan ji is a two-term MLA and always speaks his mind and raises his voice for the people.” He added: “Harshavardhan ji only speaks and works according to the policy and agenda of the party and government.” Bajpai is the grandson of Rajendra Kumar Bajpai, a veteran Congress leader and former Union minister who was seen as close to Indira Gandhi. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav Friday demanded the permanent withdrawal of the “inhuman” Nazul Bill. Taking a swipe at Adityanath in a post on X, Akhilesh said: “The Nazul land issue is entirely a decision to uproot homes because a bulldozer cannot run over every house… What will the BJP gain by demolishing settled homes? Will the BJP render people homeless for the benefit of land mafias?” On Thursday, soon after the Bill was sent to a Select Committee, Akhilesh said the BJP government wanted the law for “the personal benefit” of some people. “There are many such lands in Gorakhpur which some people want to grab to expand their sphere of influence… It is hoped that the Chief Minister will take suo motu cognisance and will not let any such plan succeed, especially in Gorakhpur,” he wrote on X. Gorakhpur is Adityanath’s political turf.

"""Can India's cold deal-breaking season halt a costly trade pact?""","Trade agreement: Why India made a U-turn on free trade deals  After a decade of scepticism over free trade deals, India has been signing a bevy of new agreements with a number of countries to reduce trade barriers, eliminate tariffs and gain preferential access to global markets. Earlier this year, the country brought into force a comprehensive economic partnership with the UAE and signed an ambitious trade pact with Australia, committing to reduce tariffs by 85%. Advanced negotiations are also under way to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with the UK and the EU. These deals are expected to cover a range of products and services from textiles to alcohol, automobiles, pharmaceuticals as well as subjects like labour movement, intellectual property enforcement and data protection. Indian and UK officials are working ""intensively"" to conclude a ""majority of talks on a comprehensive and balanced FTA by the end of October 2022"", the UK said in a statement last week. The re-launch of FTA negotiations with the EU after a protracted wait was reflective of a ""new India which wishes to engage with the developed world as friends, from a position of fairness"", India's Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said last month. This renewed zeal marks a sharp departure from India's trepidation about trade liberalisation over much of the last decade. In 2019, India famously pulled out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), touted to be the world's largest trade agreement between China and 14 other Asian countries, after being part of the negotiations for seven years. Delhi was concerned that the agreement would reduce duties on imported goods by 80-90%, and further widen India's large trade imbalance with China, exposing domestic producers to greater foreign competition. The government's assessment of India's existing FTAs and preferential trade pacts isn't favourable either. According to NITI Aayog, the public policy think tank of India, while bilateral trade with partner countries like Japan, South Korea and the ASEAN region increased following the signing of trade deals, imports rose more sharply than exports, leading to ""unfavourable gains"" to India's trade partners. Which is why India's approach this time is to achieve a ""fair and balanced"" FTA with complementary economies, focused less on competition and more on collaboration, according to Mr Goyal. But achieving this balance might be easier said than done. In Akluj in Maharashtra state in western India, Fratelli, one of India's biggest winemakers, has been producing wine for the last 15 years. Gaurav Sekhri, who co-founded the brand, says the company has been growing at 30-40% over the last couple of years, as Indians start to develop a taste for wine. But as India fast-tracks free-trade negotiations with countries like the UK and the EU, he's worried about more competition from cheaper, imported brands, just as the sector is on the cusp of maturing. Mr Sekhri expects the terms of the UK and EU deals to be similar to the FTA signed with Australia where duties on wines over $5 have been reduced from 150% to 100%, with further phased reductions over the next decade. He says the industry needs some protection because consumers will be more inclined to choose non-Indian wines of the same cost as they are perceived to be of better quality. ""Also the life of our vineyards is lesser compared to European vineyards. And for that reason alone our costs will be higher and protection will be necessary,"" adds Mr Sekhri. But opposition to trade liberalisation is muted. Textile and apparel firms, which recorded the highest ever exports in the last financial year, are enthused by the prospect of lower tariffs on their goods. Mumbai based Milaya Embroideries, which produces clothing for global fashion brands like Dolce and Gabbana and Emporio Armani, is currently hit by a double whammy of tariffs - while importing raw material from Europe and while exporting finished clothes back to the continent. Apparel manufacturers have also been losing business to countries such as Vietnam which recently ratified its FTA with the EU. For them, the imperative to act is greater. ""It's much cheaper for European companies to place orders with Vietnamese vendors because they don't have to pay duties. Whereas duties are between 9% and 16% for imports from India. I think we will see a lot of demand from the customers if the duty rates are slashed,"" said Shashank Jain, COO of Milaya Inc. For India and its partners, the reasons behind the renewed interest in these trade talks are as much strategic as they are economic. India's annual merchandise exports crossing the $400bn mark in the last fiscal year - a 40% annual jump - has reduced ""the hesitation around giving additional market access"", said Biswajit Dhar, a professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University. But equally, as countries like Britain look to expand supply chains towards the Indo-Pacific in a post-Brexit world, and global firms adopt a strategy in which they avoid investing only in China and diversify their businesses to alternative markets, Delhi has been presented with a rare opportunity to become globally integrated. Amitendu Palit, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore, says increased collaboration between countries like India, Australia, Japan and the US reflect their growing anxiety over China's control over supply chains and its ability to disrupt them. But experts are also concerned about the ""dichotomy"" between India's FTA strategy and its overall trade policy. ""(The) new-found enthusiasm for FTA seems to conflict with its trade-policy stance under the self-reliant India initiative, whose genesis is on ""vocal for local"", thereby promoting domestically produced goods over imported goods,"" researchers Surender Singh and Suvajit Banerjee recently wrote in the journal Economic and Political Weekly. India has undertaken more than 3,000 tariff increases which has affected 70% of imports, according to Arvind Subramanian, former economic adviser to the government. This ""lack of synergy"" between trade policy and FTA strategy ""not only weakens India's negotiating capacity, but also undermines the potential economic benefits of free trade,"" Mr Singh and Mr Banerjee say. Ironing out these inconsistencies will be of essence. The timing will be key as well. The timelines set to conclude these deals are ambitious. India can ill afford to lose the pace because by the middle of next year, the election cycle will get under way. ""Once you lose momentum, it can be very long drawn,"" warns Mr Dhar.

 ""IDF targets Beirut suburb in retaliation for attack that killed 12 in the Negev Desert""","Israel says it killed Hezbollah leader in Beirut strike after attack on Golan Heights          Israel’s military says it has killed a Hezbollah official who it blamed for a deadly attack last week on the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 young people. The Israel Defense Forces said it killed Fuad Shukr on Tuesday in an airstrike in the area of Beirut in Lebanon. The IDF said that Shukr “was the commander responsible for the murder of the 12 children in Majdal Shams in northern Israel on Saturday evening, as well as the killing of numerous Israelis and foreign nationals over the years.” Israel was targeting Shukr, better known by his nickname, Hajj Mohsen, in the strike in a suburb of southern Beirut, an Israeli official told NBC News. Mohsen is a senior adviser to Hezbollah’s supreme leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a member of the group’s military council, according to a U.S. government profile. Shukr “has the blood of many Israelis on his hands. Tonight, we have shown that the blood of our people has a price, and that there is no place out of reach for our forces to this end,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the rocket attack Saturday, which struck a soccer field in the Golan Heights. Militants in Lebanon and Israel have been trading fire since Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel and the start of the war in Gaza, raising fears that the fighting will spiral into a regional conflict. Al Manar, a satellite television station run by Hezbollah, reported that Israel had ""launched an aerial aggression that targeted the southern suburb of Beirut."" ""Local sources reported that the raid in the Haret Hreik area was carried out by a drone and 3 missiles were fired,"" the report added. The television station also said a building Israel targeted in the Haret Hreik area, a Hezbollah stronghold, had collapsed. Al Manar reported that two people were killed and at least 10 were wounded in the strike. Personnel from the emergency room at Bahman Hospital in Beirut told NBC News that a woman was killed and 17 other people were wounded, including six children and two who were in critical condition. In a statement, the Lebanese Red Cross said more than one person had been killed and over 20 had been injured. The Lebanese Health Ministry said a woman was killed and up to 68 other people were injured, five of them critically. Photographs from the area also showed cars crushed and covered with rubble. Saturday's strike on Majdal Shams killed at least 12 people, most of them children and teenagers belonging to the minority Druze community. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack. In a series of statements Saturday, it did say it had struck nearby military targets in the Golan Heights. In one statement, it claimed to have used a Falaq-1 rocket, the same munition Israel says hit the soccer field. However, the timings in the Hezbollah statements do not neatly align with the strike. Hezbollah said the Falaq-1 rocket was fired at 5:20 p.m., while the IDF says Majdal Shams was hit at 6:18 p.m. The Israeli military said the attack on Majdal Shams, which is on the border with Lebanon, was the deadliest strike on civilians in Israeli territory since Oct. 7. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed back to Tel Aviv from the U.S. as outrage built in Israel. “Israel is approaching the moment of an all-out war against Hezbollah,” the Israeli military said at the time. “The IDF is prepared and ready to protect Israel’s security.” In January, an Israeli airstrike on Beirut killed Saleh Arouri, a top Hamas official. It was the first time Israel had hit Beirut since the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Asked for comment Tuesday's strike, a White House National Security Council spokesperson told NBC News that the agency defers to Israel ""to speak to its own military operations"" but supports its right to defend itself. ""Our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad and unwavering against all Iran-backed threats, including Hezbollah, and we are working on a diplomatic solution that will allow citizens to safely return to their homes,"" the spokesperson said. Israel’s military said that Shukr joined Hezbollah in 1985 and that he was the head of Hezbollah’s Strategic Unit and had responsibility for weaponry that included missiles, rockets and drones.

The coalition further called on Beijing to “cease all material and political support to Russia’s war effort,” specifically naming the transfer of “dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia’s defence sector” — in NATO’s first explicit accusation that the administration of Xi Jinping is providing military aid to Moscow. “It’s the first time that NATO allies state this so clearly in an agreed document,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a Wednesday address. “It cannot continue like this without it impacting the interests and reputation of China.” NATO has been deeply entrenched in its support for non-member Ukraine since the dawns of Russia’s invasion, widely viewing Moscow as a potential threat to broader European security. Beijing has previously repeatedly denied supplying weapons to Russia in the war in Ukraine, but the two nations have maintained close trade relations throughout the conflict, even as Moscow finds itself increasingly divorced from or outright sanctioned by the West. A CNBC analysis last year found that Moscow was at the time sourcing semiconductors and other advanced Western technologies through intermediary countries, including China. Earlier this week, Beijing started joint military exercises with Russia’s close ally Belarus at a training ground mere miles away from the Polish border, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said in a Google-translated Telegram post. The territory of Belarus previously served as a launching pad for Russia’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine. On the February 2023 first-year anniversary of the Ukraine war, China — which a month later successfully capitalized on goodwill earned as a trade partner to broker a reconciliation between arch-enemies Iran and Saudi Arabia — pitched a peace framework for the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv. It, like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s peace plan and Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin’s own recent conditions to ignite diplomatic negotiations, has so far failed to gain traction. Earlier this week, China was the third stop in the world tour of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a crucial Putin ally who debuted his self-declared “peace mission” to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. After visiting Ukraine and Russia, Orban met with Xi in Beijing, praising China as a “key power” to resolve the hostilities. After years of a velvet-gloved diplomacy and approaching China as a distant concern, NATO on Wednesday said Beijing “continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security,” underscoring the alleged disinformation stemming from the world’s second-largest economy and its activities in space and cyberspace. Back in March, NATO members the U.S. and U.K. accused China of a years-long cyberespionage campaign against politicians, businesses and journalists. The practices exposed “China’s continuous and brash efforts to undermine our nation’s cybersecurity and target Americans and our innovation,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said at the time. In response, the Chinese embassy to the U.K. condemned Britain’s “sinister action.” “The UK’s claim that China was responsible for malicious cyber campaigns targeting the U.K. is completely unfounded and constitutes malicious slander,” it said at the time. NATO also raised alarms over China’s alleged nuclear ambitions. “The PRC continues to rapidly expand and diversify its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems. We urge the PRC to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions and promote stability through transparency,” the NATO communique said, warning that allies are simultaneously raising their “shared awareness” and enhancing preparations to protect against China’s “coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.” The Federation of American Scientists estimates that China has a total inventory of 500 warheads as of March — a mere 9% of the arsenal of Russia, which possesses the largest nuclear capabilities after inheriting the reserves of the former Soviet Union. “China is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country,” Hans Kristensen, associate senior fellow at the Stockholm International Peach Research Institute said back in June, when the institute released its yearly publication analyzing world nuclear powers. “The Chinese nuclear stockpile is projected to continue growing over the coming decade and the number of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) is likely to reach or even exceed the numbers held by either the Russian Federation or the United States,” SPRI found last month. CNBC has reached out to China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a scathing riposte, China’s mission to the European Union said that the NATO statement “hypes up China-Russia relations undercutting and reshaping the rules-based international order” and is “filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric.” It added, “The China-related paragraphs are provocative with obvious lies and smears. We firmly reject and deplore these accusations and have lodged serious representations with NATO.” The NATO comments to China come after the leaders of several Indo-Pacific countries — such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea — are attending the Washington NATO summit, according to Reuters, extending a practice that began after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

"""China's economy booms despite challenges of a growing, youthful population""","Publications   The Internaional Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook, issued on April 16, projected China’s economic growth rate at 4.6% and 4.1% for, respectively, 2024 and 2025. In 2023, after China’s economic reopening with the end of the ‘zero-COVID’ policy, the rate was 5.2%, above the official target of 5% (Figure 1). For 2024, the official target has been set at 5% again. Notwithstanding the challenges we discuss here, China’s macroeconomic performance in the first quarter of 2024 has been in sync with the official target (He et al, 2024).   Six headwinds affecting China’s economic growth in the coming years can be identified. The first is the exhaustion of the real-estate sector as a growth factor, after having grown to a quarter of the country’s GDP. Restrictions put in place in 2021 by the Chinese government on access to cheap credit for developers because of concerns about the size of the real estate bubble, have not only cut the boom, but have also exposed the fragility of developers’ assets, as highlighted by the collapse of developer Evergrande. Since then, there has been a sharp drop in home sales, new construction, and investment in the sector (Figure 2). Local government debt is another problem, especially because local government revenues from land sales to real-estate developers have shrunk. The degree of exposure of Chinese banks to both real estate and local government, with possible consequences in terms of loan defaults, could negatively affect the supply of credit to the economy. The third challenge for growth is a problem with domestic demand by households. Chinese households took on heavy debt to buy real estate during the boom, and spending cuts accompanied the housing turbulence. Even though it increased after the end of Zero-COVID last year, domestic consumption remains on a lower trajectory than before the pandemic. Measures of consumer confidence point to this. Reduced private investment in the domestic market, as well as reduced hiring, have accompanied this retrenchment by domestic consumers. What about the external sector as a form of compensation? A fourth challenge to Chinese growth lies in external resistance to such an increase in exports as an alternative, given that they now face resistance that has built up in the wake of the intensification of geopolitical rivalry abroad, especially in relation to the U.S. and other advanced economies. The Chinese lead in clean-energy technology has, in fact, been accompanied by a strong expansion, for example, in sales of electric cars abroad. Chinese passenger-car exports have surpassed Japan’s, at the same time as Chinese companies are seeking to strengthen positions abroad—such as BYD in Brazil, Hungary, and elsewhere. But the risks of facing additional market-access restrictions are high. A fifth challenge concerns the radical change in the mood of foreign investors. Since the third quarter of 2023, China’s balance of payments has recorded a net outflow of almost $12 billion in direct investment, because of asset sales or non-reinvestment of profits. Portfolio investment, that is shares and debt securities, has also changed from positive to negative. The insufficiency of aggregate demand in China is manifested as deflation in the domestic economy. Consumer prices have been stable or falling for months, and companies have been reducing prices for more than a year (Figure 4, left panel). Idle capacity is high in many sectors, reflecting the excess investments relative to levels of demand (Figure 4, right panel). Demography is the sixth challenge. The increase in the supply of workers accompanying rapid urbanization has reached its limits. The long-term decline in the number of births and the ongoing population decline, with a growing share of the population out of the job market, means—as in many other parts of the world—the end of the demographic dividend (Andrade and Canuto, 2024) (Figure 5). The currently high youth unemployment rate means there are workers who can be employed, but this does not change the direction on the trend, or the proportion of Chinese people of non-productive age. To understand how the first four challenges above intertwine, it is worth going back to the beginning of the last decade. In December 2011, when I was a World Bank vice president, I was at a ceremony in Beijing in which then-president Hu Jintao made one of the first statements about the need for an inevitable “rebalancing” of the Chinese economy. There would have to be a gradual redirection towards a new growth pattern, he said, no longer associated with investment rates close to 50% of GDP, or with domestic consumption increasing in relation to investments and exports. Also, Hu Jintao said, an effort would be needed to consolidate local insertion in the highest rungs of the added-value ladder in global value chains, something that was effectively sought. Services should also increase their weight in GDP in relation to manufacturing. There would no longer be the double-digit GDP growth rates of previous decades, but growth would no longer be, as then-premier Wen Jiabao said in 2007, “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable”. Given the low level of domestic consumption in GDP (a fact that is still present) and, therefore, the dependence on investments and trade balances, the transition would run the risk of experiencing an abrupt drop in the pace of growth. To allay fears of an abrupt slowdown, waves of credit-driven overinvestment in infrastructure and housing followed in later years. A second round was implemented in 2015–2017, in response to a housing slowdown and stock market decline. In addition, of course, expansion policies were adopted during the pandemic crisis in 2020. In effect, the decline in Chinese GDP growth rates occurred only gradually to 6% in 2019. Now, however, the lever of overinvestment in real estate and infrastructure is running out, not only because of the debt levels that accompanied its extensive use, but also because, at the margin, its returns in terms of GDP growth represented a declining contribution. Two reforms would have a strong effect on growth (Canuto, 2022). First, social protection should be reinforced to convince Chinese people to save less. Furthermore, the proposal made by Hu Jintao in 2011—and left aside by Xi Jinping—to “rebalance” public and private companies should be revived, with a consequent gain in productivity because of the differences favorable to the latter shown where they operate together. Such reforms do not seem to be on the horizon. However, despite the challenges outlined here, China’s economic growth path remained steady in the first quarter of 2024. Exports, manufacturing investment, and travel-related consumer spending compensated for the drag from the property sector (Figure 6), so far increasing the chances of achieving the target of “around 5%” GDP growth this year (He et al, 2024).

"""Elon Musk drops lawsuit against OpenAI, Sam Altman in state court""","Elon Musk drops suit against OpenAI and Sam Altman                                                                                                                      Elon Musk on Tuesday withdrew his lawsuit against OpenAI and two of the company’s co-founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, in California state court. Musk’s decision to file to dismiss the suit came just one day after he publicly criticized OpenAI and its new partnership with Apple. The case was dismissed without prejudice, according to a court filing obtained by CNBC. In February, Musk had filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, Altman and Brockman — the current CEO and president of OpenAI, respectively — for breach of contract and fiduciary duty. A hearing was scheduled for Wednesday in San Francisco, in which the judge was going to consider whether the case should be dismissed as requested by the defendants. Experts told CNBC in March that the case was built on a questionable legal foundation, because the contract at the heart of the suit was not a formal written agreement that was signed by all parties involved. Rather, Musk had alleged that the early OpenAI team had set out to develop artificial general intelligence, or AGI, “for the benefit of humanity,” but that the project has been transformed into a for-profit entity that’s largely controlled by principal shareholder Microsoft. Musk had used much of the 35-page complaint (plus attached exhibits) he filed in March to remind the world of his position in the creation of a company that’s since become one of the hottest startups on the planet, (OpenAI ranked first on CNBC’s Disruptor 50 list in 2023) thanks largely to the viral spread of ChatGPT. “It’s certainly a good advertisement for the benefit of Elon Musk,” Kevin O’Brien, partner at Ford O’Brien Landy LLP and former assistant U.S. attorney, told CNBC at the time. “I’m not sure about the legal part though.” Last year, Musk debuted his own AI startup and OpenAI competitor, xAI, which last month announced a $6 billion Series B funding round. Investors included Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Fidelity Management & Research Company. X.AI seeks to “understand the true nature of the universe,” according to its website. Last year, X.AI released a chatbot called Grok, which the company says is modeled after “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” The chatbot debuted with two months of training and has real-time knowledge of the internet, the company claims. Representatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. —CNBC’s Lora Kolodny contributed to this report. Correction: The lawsuit was filed in February.

"""Delta CEO claims CrowdStrike-Microsoft disruption saved the airline $500 million""","Delta's CEO says the CrowdStrike outage cost the airline $500 million in 5 days  By  Jason Breslow A Delta Air Lines jet takes off at the Los Angeles International Airport in April. Ed Bastian, the airline's CEO, says the CrowdStrike outage has cost the carrier $500 million. The CEO of Delta Air Lines says the massive CrowdStrike outage that hobbled its flight operations earlier this month, leaving thousands of passengers stranded, has cost the airline as much as $500 million. The outage hit Delta harder than most of its competitors. The airline was forced to cancel more than 5,000 flights as a result of the outage, which stymied businesses worldwide when a failed software update from CrowdStrike, a major cybersecurity firm, crashed operations for millions of users running Microsoft Windows devices. Speaking on CNBC on Wednesday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the airline is now preparing for litigation as it looks to recover from the outage. “We have no choice,” Bastian said about potential action against CrowdStrike. “We’re not looking to wipe them out, but we’re looking to make certain that we get compensated however they decide to for what they cost us. Half a billion dollars in five days.” In a public letter released earlier this month, Bastian said the software outage hit on what was the “busiest travel weekend of the summer” for the airline with the nation's third largest fleet size. It caused massive disruption to Delta's crew-tracking system, a mission critical tool used to pair pilots and flight attendants with flights. During his interview with CNBC, Bastian said Delta was heavily reliant on CrowdStrike and Microsoft for its cybersecurity. “We’re by far the heaviest in the industry with both, and so we got hit the hardest in terms of the recovery capability,” he said. To help get back online, the company had to manually reset 40,000 servers, according to Bastian. He said the Atlanta-based carrier is now back up and running and over the last seven days has had less than 100 cancellations in aggregate over 30,000 flights. Still, Delta has been left to recover from both a massive financial and reputational hit. It also faces an investigation by the U.S. Department of Transportation over its response to the outage. No suit has yet been filed by Delta, but Bastian’s comments could portend the start of a wave of litigation against CrowdStrike for the outage. Delta has already hired the prominent litigator David Boies, chairman of the firm Boies Schiller Flexner, in advance of a potential lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the decision who was not authorized to speak publicly. “If you’re going to be having access, priority access to the Delta ecosystem in terms of technology, you’ve got to test the stuff. You can’t come into a mission-critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug,” Bastian told CNBC. In a statement, a spokesperson for CrowdStrike said, “We are aware of the reporting, but have no knowledge of a lawsuit and have no further comment.""",False,False,False

" Deadpool & Wolverine's $38.5 million in Thursday previews, on track for record opening weekend","Box Office: ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ Makes Record-Breaking $38.5 Million in Previews   Deadpool is known for breaking the fourth wall, but now he’s breaking down the box office. Marvel‘s “Deadpool & Wolverine,” the official MCU debut of Ryan Reynolds’s Merc With a Mouth and Hugh Jackman’s be-clawed X-Men character, made a massive $38.5 million in Thursday previews at the box office. The Thursday haul is the biggest of the year so far, easily beating Disney’s animated family hit “Inside Out 2,” which made $13 million last month. It’s also the highest preview gross ever for an R-rated movie. The first “Deadpool” made $12.7 million in Thursday night previews back in 2016, and its 2018 sequel topped that with $18.6 million, which held the R-rated record until now. So, expect records to keep tumbling as the weekend progresses. Internationally — where “Deadpool & Wolverine” is open in every major market except China, where it begins screening on Friday — the film has earned $64.8 million.  Some estimates are putting “Deadpool & Wolverine” on track to open domestically with a excellent $160 million to $170 million, but based on the preview numbers, those projections are likely too conservative. Other analysts and studios are predicting it will open closer to $190 million or even $200 million. A launch at that level would make it the highest-grossing opening weekend of the year, surpassing the $155 million for “Inside Out 2.” The film is expected to make between $350 million and $390 million globally after its first weekend. It cost $200 million to produce and approximately $100 million to market, so it’s on track for a hugely successful run.  So why is “Deadpool & Wolverine” so popular? After Disney acquired Fox and its movie properties, the Mouse House is finally bringing the popular X-Men and Fantastic Four characters into its Marvel Cinematic Universe. VIP+ Analysis: ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ Underscores MCU’s Much-Needed Evolution Reynolds’ Deadpool and Jackman’s Wolverine can finally cross over with the likes of Captain America, Thor and Spider-Man — nearly ever Marvel fan’s dream. Shawn Levy directs “Deadpool & Wolverine,” which is expected to have an “Avengers: Endgame”-level of cameos from the previously abandoned Fox properties. After a rocky start, the box office will be in good shape this weekend. Last week’s champion, “Twisters,” is projected to make between $36 million and $40 million in its second weekend.

"""Boeing Advises Airlines to Disregard 737 Max Planes for Potential Over-Tightened Bolts""","Boeing asks airlines to inspect 737 Max jets for potential loose bolt   FILE- In this Feb. 5, 2018, file photo, a dual-tipped wing tip, known as a “winglet,” stands in view of the tail of a Boeing 737 MAX 7, the newest version of Boeing’s fastest-selling airplane, while displayed during a debut for employees and media of the new jet in Renton, Wash. Boeing is asking airlines to inspect its 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder control system, the airplane maker and Federal Aviation Administration confirmed this week, Friday, Dec. 29, 2023. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) Boeing is asking airlines to inspect its 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder control system, the airplane maker and Federal Aviation Administration confirmed this week. The FAA said it would be “closely monitoring” the targeted inspections. The agency said Thursday that Boeing issued its inspection guidance to airlines after an international operator found a bolt with a missing nut during routine maintenance. In a separate case, Boeing also discovered an undelivered aircraft that had a nut that was not properly tightened. “The issue identified on the particular airplane has been remedied,” the Arlington, Virginia, company told The Associated Press on Friday. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending operators inspect their 737 MAX airplanes and inform us of any findings.” Boeing added that it will continue to update both customers and federal regulators on the progress. The FAA said it will remain in contact with Boeing and impacted airlines as the inspections are performed, and potentially “consider additional action based on any further discovery of loose or missing hardware.” According to Boeing, there have been no in-flight incidents caused by this condition to date — noting that crews’ routine checks would signal if the rudder was not working properly before an aircraft pushes back from the gate. The company added that all airplanes Boeing is set to deliver onward will have the inspection (which is estimated to take about two hours per plane) prior to delivery.  U.S. carriers with 737 Max jets in their fleet include United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines. All four of these carriers told The Associated Press Friday that they don’t expect operational impacts. Southwest, for example, said it was currently performing all of these inspections during routine overnight maintenance. A firm timeline for the inspections wasn’t provided for each airline, but Alaska said it expected to complete the process by the first half of January. Boeing’s 737 Max jets were grounded worldwide for 20 months after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed a total of 346 people. Investigations focused on an automated flight-control system that pushed the nose of the plane down based on faulty sensor readings. Boeing did not tell pilots and airlines about the system until after the first crash. The FAA, which also faced criticism for the way it approved the Max jets prior to these deadly crashes, has since moved to provide a more-detailed certification process for large planes and required safety disclosures.

According to Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut in September have risen as a result of the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching 40,000 for the first time and a softer-than-expected April inflation data.

The 3-positive catalysts were election jitters recede, hopefully, FIIs to turn buyers’ post-election results, and trader’s cheer encouraging US inflation news.

Adobe cancels its $20 Billion Figma acquisition plan,"Adobe abandons $20 billion acquisition of Figma  By Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Following mounting pressure from regulators in the UK and EU, Adobe and Figma announced on Monday that both companies are mutually terminating their merger agreement, which would have seen Adobe acquire the Figma product design platform for $20 billion. As a result of the termination, Adobe will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion in cash. “Adobe and Figma strongly disagree with the recent regulatory findings, but we believe it is in our respective best interests to move forward independently,” said Adobe chair and CEO Shantanu Narayen in a statement. “While Adobe and Figma shared a vision to jointly redefine the future of creativity and productivity, we continue to be well positioned to capitalize on our massive market opportunity and mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences.” Regulators cited Adobe’s near-monopoly in the design software market as they pushed back on the deal. By purchasing Figma, a fast-growing product design platform that’s now more popular than Adobe’s rival XD application, regulators worried that Adobe would harm innovation that could have occurred should Figma be allowed to flourish independently. Designers have expressed similar worries since the merger was announced in September 2022, but Adobe pushed back on those claims throughout the various ongoing probes. In a letter dated December 14th, Adobe rejected remedies suggested by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to approve the merger following an in-depth antitrust probe. The authority wanted Adobe to make a significant divestment of assets, source code, and engineers to “restore the conditions of competition.” All parties were expected to discuss the CMA’s provisional decision to block the deal on December 21st, with a final deadline to approve or block the acquisition set for February 25th. The deal was being similarly scrutinized by the European Commission, and Bloomberg reported in February 2023 that the DOJ was preparing similar investigations. Following Adobe’s announcement, the European Commission has now also dropped its antitrust investigation into the merger. With all that pressure mounting, Adobe had very little wriggle room to push the deal forward and still get all of the Figma assets it had hoped to obtain — or, in the case of its own apps being sacrificed in antitrust appeasement, retain. “It’s not the outcome we had hoped for,” said Figma CEO Dylan Field in a statement. “But despite thousands of hours spent with regulators around the world detailing differences between our businesses, our products, and the markets we serve, we no longer see a path toward regulatory approval of the deal.” Update, December 18th, 9.40AM ET: Article updated to note that the EU has now dropped its official antitrust investigation into Adobe’s Figma acquisition.

"""Meta's advertising decline shows that massive AI investments are failing to yield results.""","Mark Zuckerberg warned investors that Meta's AI investment won't pay off immediately  Meta's stock tumbled about 16% after trading hours despite posting better-than-expected Q1 results. The company reported a lackluster revenue forecast along with deep investments in AI. Making money off of AI will take time, Mark Zuckerberg told investors on Wednesday. Despite posting record revenue for the January-March quarter, Meta's stock is being bogged down on Wednesday by the company's increasing investments in AI. Meta reported a 27% year-over-year increase with $36.46 billion in sales for Q1, beating analysts' forecasts. Yet, shares for Meta tumbled about 16% after trading hours on Wednesday following the company's first-quarter results. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, forecasted that its revenue for the second quarter will fall in the range of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Analysts estimated the company would see revenue closer to $38.24 billion. A second aspect of Meta's report that's clouding the first-quarter performance results is the company's massive investments in AI, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg said will be necessary before the company can expect to see major returns. Meta said that it expects capital expenditures for 2024 to fall in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, which is higher than the $30 billion to $37 billion expectation, as it continues to invest in infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg told shareholders during the Wednesday earnings call that Meta's stock volatility is par for the course for any new project or feature the company was working on that wasn't immediately generating revenue. Meta's investment in AI is no different, Zuckerberg said, but the CEO cautioned that the returns for artificial intelligence will take some time. ""Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us. And the initial signs are quite positive here too,"" he said. ""But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps and this is likely going to take several years on the upside once our new AI services reach scale."" In the lead up to the first-quarter results, Meta launched its latest version of its chatbot, Llama 3, which will power the company's new AI assistant, Meta AI. Zuckerberg said that the AI assistant will be integrated into many of Meta's products, including Instagram and Facebook. Meta said that Llama 3 is the ""most capable"" open source model out there, but as Business Insider's Hasan Chowdhury reported, the tool has yet to beat ChatGPT 4, OpenAI's language model that was released last year.
