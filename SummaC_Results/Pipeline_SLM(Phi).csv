Psilocybin temporarily dissolves brain networks,"Psilocybin desynchronizes brain networks  An official website of the United States government   Preview improvements coming to the PMC website in October 2024. Learn More or Try it out now. The relationship between the acute effects of psychedelics and their persisting neurobiological and psychological effects is poorly understood. Here, we tracked brain changes with longitudinal precision functional mapping in healthy adults before, during, and for up to 3 weeks after oral psilocybin and methylphenidate (17 MRI visits per participant) and again 6+ months later. Psilocybin disrupted connectivity across cortical networks and subcortical structures, producing more than 3-fold greater acute changes in functional networks than methylphenidate. These changes were driven by desynchronization of brain activity across spatial scales (area, network, whole brain). Psilocybin-driven desynchronization was observed across association cortex but strongest in the default mode network (DMN), which is connected to the anterior hippocampus and thought to create our sense of self. Performing a perceptual task reduced psilocybin-induced network changes, suggesting a neurobiological basis for grounding, connecting with physical reality during psychedelic therapy. The acute brain effects of psilocybin are consistent with distortions of space-time and the self. Psilocybin induced persistent decrease in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and cortex (and DMN in particular), lasting for weeks but normalizing after 6 months. Persistent suppression of hippocampal-DMN connectivity represents a candidate neuroanatomical and mechanistic correlate for psilocybin’s pro-plasticity and anti-depressant effects. Psychedelic drugs can reliably induce powerful changes in the perception of self, time and space via agonism of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A receptor)1,2. In clinical trials, a single high dose of psilocybin has demonstrates immediate and sustained symptom relief in depression3–8, and addiction9. Taken together, these two observations suggest that psychedelics should have distinct neurobiological signatures corresponding to acute (intoxication) and persisting (after the drug has been eliminated from the body) phases. Acute effects of psilocybin include increase in glucose metabolism in frontal and medial temporal cortex10,11. EEG and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies of acute psychedelic effects have reported decreased signal power12,13 and functional connectivity (FC) with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), and LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) broadly across the cortex. These seemingly paradoxical observations of increased metabolism and decreased signal power are not understood. Persisting effects of psychedelics include increase in the expression of genes that contribute to synaptic plasticity14,15, and increase in growth of neurites and synapses in vitro16, and in vivo17–19. Network-level correlates of persisting psilocybin effects remain unknown in humans. Rodent models have suggested that the burst of plasticity in the medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus may be key to psilocybin’s antidepressant effects16,17,20. The medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus form core part of the default mode network21 and increased cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms22. Precision functional mapping (PFM) utilizes dense repeated rsfMRI sampling23–25 to reveal the timecourses of individual-specific intervention-driven brain connectivity changes26. The PFM approach takes advantage of the high variability in brain networks across individuals and high stability within individuals24. We applied the PFM approach to detail the individual-specific acute and persistent effects of a single high dose of psilocybin (25mg). Healthy young adults received psilocybin (PSIL) and methylphenidate (MTP, generic Ritalin, dose-matched for arousal effects) on different days and underwent regular MRI sessions (~18 per participant) each before, during, between, and after the two drug doses (Fig. S1A). Dense pre-drug sampling familiarized participants with the scanner and establish baseline variability. We found that psilocybin produced changes in brain network structure that far exceeded those induced by other state changes such as treatment with methylphenidate, or an auditory-visual task. Interrogation of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal revealed that the highly conserved spatial structure of resting BOLD fluctuations was dramatically altered by psilocybin. Finally, we identified a change in hippocampal-cortical connectivity that persisted for weeks after psilocybin and had normalized by the time participants returned for additional open label psilocybin doses 6+ months later. Psilocybin acutely caused profound and widespread brain network changes (Figs. 1a, S2, S3), greater than 3x larger than the effects of methylphenidate or other manipulations (task engagement = 1.30, methylphenidate = 1.51, high head motion = 1.46, psilocybin = 4.58, between person = 4.58). To put psilocybin’s effects in perspective, it helps to consider that the differences in an individuals’ brain organization on/off drug were as large as those between different persons (Fig. 1b). Brain-wide connectivity change (Euclidian distance) was calculated across the cortex and subcortical structures and effects of condition were determined with a linear mixed effects (LME) model. a) Top: psilocybin-associated network change (LME model, t-statistic). Middle: methylphenidate-associated network stimulant. Bottom: day to day FC variability (random effect of day). b) Whole Brain network change magnitude (Euclidian distance between brain-wide connectivity matrices) reveals that psilocybin produces much larger change than methylphenidate, closer in magnitude to between person differences. Vertical bars and asterisks indicate significance (p<0.05) for post-hoc t-test between conditions. c) Change by system (resting-state network), based on individualized Infomap parcellation. Open circles represent individual subjects, bars represent average magnitude. *Disruption was significantly enriched within the default mode network based on rotation permutation testing. d) Psilocybin Network Change across the bilateral hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (same color scale as panel a). In the cortex, psilocybin-associated changes localized to association networks. To assess resting state networks (RSNs, referred to here as ‘systems’) specificity, we ran a community detection algorithm on each participant and then compared network change between system, using a rotation-based null model27. Psilocybin-associated change was greatest in the default mode networks (Fig. 1c). By contrast, network changes associated with methylphenidate consistently localized to motor and action communities (Fig. S3). Individual-specific psilocybin-induced brain changes were consistent when participants returned 6 months later for a second psilocybin dose (correlation between change maps; r=0.67) (Fig. S2). In subcortex, the largest psilocybin-associated network changes were seen in DMN-connected parts of the thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and hippocampus (Fig. 1d)21,28,29. In the hippocampus, foci of strong FC disruption were in the anterior hippocampus (MNI: −24, −22,16 and 24, −18,16). In the basal ganglia, the largest FC disruptions were seen in mediodorsal (MD) thalamus and anteromedial caudate. In the cerebellum the largest FC disruptions were seen in the DMN29. To examine the latent dimensions of variability in brain networks across participant, drug condition, and task, we performed multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) on brain networks from every session24. Dimension 1 (Dim1), the dimension which explained the largest amount of variability across the dataset, largely separated psilocybin from other scans (Fig. 2a), apart from one session where the participant (P5R) vomited 30 minutes after taking the psilocybin dose and was not re-dosed (red dots on the left of Fig. 2a). The higher score on Dim1 associated with psilocybin, corresponded to reduced segregation between default mode, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and cingulo-opercular network – systems that are normally anticorrelated 30(Figs. 2c and S5). Subtraction of average FC during psilocybin minus baseline revealed a similar pattern of FC change (Fig. S5). To determine if this reflects a common effect of psilocybin that generalized across dataset and psychedelics, we calculated Dim1 scores for extant datasets from participants receiving I.V. psilocybin31 and LSD32. Psychedelic increased Dim1 in nearly every participant in the LSD and psilocybin datasets (Fig. 2d). In the scatter plots, each point represents the functional network from a single scan, plotted in a multidimensional space based on the similarity between scans. Replication scans are represented with open circles. a) Dimensions 1 and 4 are plotted for every 15-minute scan. In the top panel, points are colored based on drug condition. In the bottom panel, points are colored based on participant identity. Dimension 1 separates psilocybin from non-drug and MTP scans in most cases. Dimension 4 separates individuals in most cases and shows a small but significant before/after effect. C) Visualization of dimension 1 weights (top 1% of edges are projected onto the brain to show the connections most effected by psilocybin). D) In additional datasets with LSD (top) and psilocybin (bottom), psychedelic causes reliable change along dimension 1. By comparison, methylphenidate produced a decrease in connectivity between regions in the sensory, motor, and auditory networks (Fig. S5b), consistent with previous reports33 and similar to the effect of caffeine25. To verify that observations in our sample (N = 7) were generalizable, we compared our study’s stimulant effects to those in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study34 (n = 487 taking stimulants). The main effect of stimulant use on FC in ABCD was consistent with methylphenidate-associated FC changes in our dataset (Fig. S5b). To investigate how psilocybin-driven network changes are influenced by task states, participants were asked to complete a simple auditory-visual matching task in the scanner. Participants performed this task with high accuracy during drug sessions (Fig. S4). Engagement in the task significantly decreased the magnitude of psilocybin-associated network disruption by 43% (change (psilocybin + rest) = 4.58; change (psilocybin + task) = 2.59; unpaired t-test, P = 0.0041; Figs. 1b & S3c), suggesting that psilocybin’s acute effects on brain networks may be context dependent. The reduction of psilocybin-driven brain changes parallels the psychological principle of ‘grounding’ – directing one’s attention on sensory perception as a means of alleviating intense or distressing thoughts or emotions – which is commonly employed in psychedelic-associated psychotherapy35. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of context-dependent effects of psilocybin on functional connectivity and fills an important gap between preclinical studies of context dependence36,37 and clinical observations38. Evoked responses during the auditory-visual matching task were largely unchanged during psilocybin, suggesting that altered neurovascular uncoupling is unlikely to account for observed FC change (Fig. S4). We observed that the normally stable spatial structure of resting fMRI fluctuations was disrupted by psilocybin, making the FC desynchronized and disorganized (see video supplement). We measured synchrony of brain signals using Normalized Global Spatial Complexity (NGSC) – a measure of spatial entropy that is independent of the number of signals39. NGSC calculates cumulative variance explained by subsequent spatiotemporal patterns (Fig. 3a). The lowest value of NGSC=0 means that the timecourse for vertex/voxel is identical. The highest value of NGSC=1 means that the timecourse for every vertex/voxel is independent – indicating maximal desynchronization (or spatial entropy). a) normalized global spatial complexity (NGSC) captures the ‘complexity’ of brain activity patterns. It is derived from the number of spatial principal components (PCs) used to explain the data. Higher entropy = less desynchronized activity. b) Whole-brain entropy (NGSC) is shown for every fMRI scan for a single participant (P6). Psilocybin scans are shown in red. At right, increases during psilocybin were present in all participants (box and whiskers indicate quartiles and 99.7th percentiles for non-drug scans, red circles indicate psilocybin) c) Entropy within functional brain areas shown similar increases. d) Spatial entropy is visualized on the cortical surface. Psilocybin-associated increase in entropy was largest in association cortices. This was replicated in LSD data (middle; using data from Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) and corresponds spatially to 5ht2A binding density (bottom; borrowed with permission from Beliveau et al., 2017). Psilocybin significantly increased NGSC (mixed effects model with individual differences and head motion as random effects, p = 9.2e-7), with levels returning to pre-drug baseline by the following session (Fig. 3b- d). The increase in NGSC was observed at whole-brain and individual brain area levels (Fig. 3c, d), with the largest increases in association cortex and minimal chance in primary cortex (Fig. 3d). Global and local desynchronization replicated in an LSD dataset (Fig. 3d)32 and the distribution of these effects closely matched PET-based maps of 5HT-2A receptor density (Fig. 3e)40. To assess if persistent neurotrophic and psychological effects of psychedelics might be reflected in network changes weeks after psilocybin, we assessed network changes 1–21 days post-psilocybin (compared to pre-drug). Whole brain network change scores were small, and not significantly different from day-to-day variability, indicating that the brain’s structure had mostly returned to baseline (Fig. S2 and S3). The anterior hippocampus forms part of the default mode network21 and atypical cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms22. The same region of the anterior hippocampus which showed strong acute FC changes with psilocybin showed persistent connectivity alterations in the three weeks post-drug period (Fig. 4a and Supplemental figure 7). This persistent suppression of FC between the anterior hippocampus and cortex was found in all participants (Fig. 4b; LME model testing change in RMS AntHippo-cortical FC with head motion as a random effect: p = 5.1e-5). a) Group network change (relative to baseline) t-maps, left hippocampus: top=acute psilocybin, bottom = persisting (2 weeks after psilocybin. b) All subjects demonstrated a weakening of anterior hippocampal-cortical FC post-psilocybin (p=5.1e-5; linear mixed effects model accounting for head motion and subject ID). c) Connectivity from an anterior hippocampus seedmap at baseline, post-psilocybin and change for an exemplar (P3). The red border on the right-most brain illustrates individual-defined default mode network. A decrease in hippocampal FC with parietal and frontal components of the DMN is seen. d) Timecourse of anterior hippocampus - DMN for all participants/scans (participant colors as in panel b). A moving average is shown in black. e) schematic of hippocampal-cortical circuits, borrowed from Zheng et al., 2021. As predicted based on typical connectivity patterns, FC between the anterior hippocampus and DMN was decreased after psilocybin (Fig. 4c- e). Timecourse visualization, after aligning psilocybin doses between subjects, suggests that connectivity is reduced for 3 weeks after psilocybin but returned to pre-drug by 6–12-month replication scans (Fig. 4d). This observation is compelling, as it localized to the anterior hippocampus, a brain region shown to demonstrate substantial synaptogenesis following psilocybin18. Reduced hippocampal-cortical FC may reflect increased flexibility of self-oriented hippocampal circuits. The synchronized patterns of co-activation in the resting brain are believed to reflect the brain’s perpetual job of modeling reality41. It follows that the stability of synchronized brain networks across day, task, methylphenidate, and arousal levels (but not between individuals), reflects the subjective stability of waking consciousness. By contrast, the much larger changes induced by psilocybin fit with participants’ subjective report of a radical change in consciousness. The large magnitude of psilocybin’s effects, in comparison to methylphenidate, suggests that observed changes are not merely a consequence of changes in arousal or a nonspecific effect of monoaminergic stimulation42. Multi-unit recording studies suggest that agonism of 5HT2A receptors by psychedelics does not uniformly increase or decrease firing of pyramidal neurons, but rather serves to desynchronize pairs or populations of neurons which co-activate under normal conditions43. We observed a parallel phenomenon at the region, and whole brain level. This may explain the paradoxical effects of psychedelic seen in PET FDG and fMRI: disruption of synchronized activity should produce a decrease in power of local fluctuations12,13, despite an increase in metabolic activity, and a loss of the brain’s segregated network structure32,44. This desynchronization of neural activity has been described as an increase in entropy or randomness of brain activity in the psychedelic state45,46 (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), and it has been hypothesized to underly the cognitive and perception changes associated with psychedelics. The dramatic departure from normal synchronized patterns of co-activation may be key not only to understanding psilocybin’s acute effects, but also its persistent neurotrophic effects. Changes in resting BOLD activity are linked to shifts in glutamate-dependent signaling during psilocybin47,48. This phenomenon, shared by ketamine and psychedelics, engages homeostatic plasticity mechanisms49 - a neurobiological response to large deviations in typical network activity patterns50–52. This response to novelty includes rapid upregulation in expression of BDNF, mTOR, EF2 and other plasticity-related immediate early genes15,48. Consistent with this notion, psilocybin produced the largest changes in the fronto-parietal and default mode network, brain systems frequently associated with neuropsychiatric disorders53. Psychedelics rapidly induce plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex and this appears to be necessary for rapid antidepressant-like effects in animal models. However, to understand the underpinnings of psychedelics’ unique effects, it is necessary to study the human brain. Advances in precision functional mapping and individual-level characterization enabled us to identify desynchronization of resting state fMRI signals and localize these changes to depression-relevant circuits. Novel methods to measure neurotrophic markers in the human brain54 will provide a critical link between mechanistic observations at the cellular, brain-systems and psychological levels. Such links will help answer fundamental questions about the diagnosis and treatment of conditions of psychiatric illness. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and procedures established by the Washington University in Saint Louis Institutional Review Board. All participants were compensated for their time. All aspects of this study were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) Internal Review Board, the Washington University Human Research Protection Office (WU HRPO), the Federal Drug Administration (IND: 202002165) and the Missouri Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) under a federal DEA schedule 1 research license and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04501653). Psilocybin was supplied by Usona Institute via Almac Clinical Services. Healthy young adults (N=7, 18–45 years) were enrolled in a randomized cross-over precision functional brain mapping study to evaluate differences in individual-level connectomics pre-, during, and post- psilocybin exposure. Participants underwent imaging during drug sessions with psilocybin (PSIL) 25mg, or methylphenidate (MTP) 40mg as well as non-drug imaging sessions. Drug condition categories were 1) before psilocybin (‘Baseline’), 2) Drug 1( methylphenidate or psilocybin), 3) between, 4) Drug2 and 5) After. A minimum of 3 non-drug imaging sessions were completed during each non-drug window: before (baseline), between and after drug sessions. The number of non-drug MRI sessions was dependent on availability of the participant, scanner and scanner support staff. Dosing day imaging sessions were conducted 60–180 minutes following drug administration during peak blood concentration55. MTP was selected as the active control condition to simulate the cardiovascular effects and physiological arousal (i.e., controlling for dopaminergic effects) associated with psilocybin (Griffiths et al., 2006). Usona Institute, a United States non-profit medical research organization, provided good manufacturing practices (GMP) psilocybin. Drug sessions were facilitated by two clinical research staff who completed an approved in-person or online facilitator training program provided by Usona Institute, as part of Usona’s phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03866174). The role of the study facilitators was to build a therapeutic alliance with the participant throughout the study, prepare them for their drug dosing days, and to observe and maintain participant safety during dosing day visits35. The pair consisted of an experienced clinician (lead clinical facilitator) and a trainee (co-facilitator).  Participants were invited to return >6 months after completing the initial cross-over study for an open label psilocybin dose (which we refer to as ‘replication protocol). This included 1–2 baseline fMRIs, a psilocybin session (identical to initial session, except for blinding), and 1–2 “after” sessions within 4 days of the dose. Healthy adults ages 18 to 45 years were recruited via campus-wide advertisement and colleague referral. Participants were enrolled from March 2021 to May 2023. Participants were required to have had at least one previous lifetime psychedelic exposure (e.g., psilocybin, mescaline, ayahuasca, LSD), but no psychedelics exposure within the past 6 months. Individuals with psychiatric illness (depression, psychosis, addiction) based on DSM-5 were excluded. Participants were scanned roughly every other day over the course of the experiment (Fig. S1). Imaging was performed at a consistent time of day to minimize diurnal effects in functional connectivity 56. Neuroimaging was performed on a Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) in the neuroimaging labs (NIL) at the Washington University Medical Center. Structural scans (T1w and T2w) were acquired for each participant at 0.9 mm isotropic resolution, with real-time motion correction. Structural scans from different sessions were averaged together for the purposes of Freesurfer segmentation and nonlinear atlas registrations. To capture high resolution images of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, we used an echo-planar imaging sequence with 2mm isotropic voxels, multi-band 6, multi-echo 5 (TEs: 14.20 ms, 38.93 ms, 63.66 ms, 88.39 ms, 113.12 ms), TR 1761ms, flip angle = 68 degrees, and in-plane acceleration57 (IPAT/grappa) = 2. This sequence acquired 72 axial slices (144mm coverage). Each resting scan included 510 frames (lasting 15:49 minutes) as well as 3 frames at the end used to provide estimate electronic noise. Every session included two rest scans, totally 30-minute resting-state fMRI, during which participants were instructed to hold still and look at a white fixation crosshair presented on a black background. Head motion was tracked in real time using Framewise Integrated Real-time MRI Monitoring software (FIRMM)58. An eye-tracking camera (EyeLink, Ottawa) was used to monitor participants for drowsiness. Participants also completed a previously validated event-related fMRI task initially designed for the purposes of modeling hemodynamic responses in the auditory, visual, and motor cortices. Two task fMRI runs were completed during a subset of imaging sessions. Task fMRI runs employed the same sequence using in resting fMRI, included 48 trials (24 congruent, 24 incongruent), and lasted a total of 410s. See supplemental methods ‘Matching task’ fMRI for details. Resting fMRI data were preprocessed using a in-house processing pipeline. Briefly, this included alignment, normalization, non-linear registration, removal of thermal noise using NORDIC59, bandpass filtering, and scrubbing at a movement threshold of 0.3mm. Tissue-based regressors were computed in volume (white matter, ventricles, extra-axial CSF)60 and applied following projection to surface. Details on rsfMRI preprocessing are provided in supplemental methods.  Surface generation and processing of functional data followed procedures similar to Glasser and colleagues 201361. For cortical regions and resting state networks, we used a surface parcellation and community assignments generated by Gordon & Laumann and colleagues27. See supplemental methods for further details on surface generation and cortical parcellation. For subcortical regions, we used a set of regions of interest (Seitzman et al., 2020) generated to achieves full coverage and optimal region homogeneity. A subcortical limbic system was defined based on neuroanatomy: amygdala, antero-medial thalamus, nucleus accumbens, anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus62. These regions were expanded to cover fill anatomical structures (e.g. anterior hippocampus)63. To generate region-wise connectivity matrices, time courses of all surface vertices or subcortical voxels within a region were averaged. Functional connectivity (FC) was then computed between each region timeseries using Fisher z-transformed Pearson correlation.  We identified canonical large-scale networks using the individual-specific network matching approach described in previously27–29. Briefly, cortical surface and subcortical volume assignemtns was derived using the graph-theory-based Infomap algorithm64. In this approach, we calculated the Pearson correlation matrix from all cortical vertices and subcortical voxels, concatenated across all a participant’s scans. Correlations between vertices within 30 mm of each other were set to zero. The Infomap algorithm was applied to each subject’s correlation matrix thresholded at a range of edge densities spanning from 0.01% to 2%. At each threshold, the algorithm returned community identities for each vertex and voxel. Communities were labeled by matching them at each threshold to a set of independent group average networks described in Gordon et al. 2016. In each individual and in the average, a “consensus” network assignment was derived by collapsing assignments across thresholds, giving each node the assignment it had at the sparsest possible threshold at which it was successfully assigned to one of the known group networks. See supplementary figure S2 and S3 for individual and group mode assignments.  Network change (‘distance’) was calculated at the vertex level to generate network change maps (Fig. 1a- d, Fig. 4) and a linear mixed effects model with wild bootstrapping65,66 was used to generate statistics on these maps. First, a distance map was generated for every scan by computing, for each vertex, the average distance between its FC seedmap and the FC seedmap for each of that subject’s baseline scans. Second, distance maps for every scan were labeled on 5 dimensions: Subject ID, MRI session, task (task/rest), drug condition (baseline, PSIL, between, MTP, after, etc.), and head motion (average framewise displacement). Distance maps and associated conditions were then used to solve a linear mixed effects model in which drug condition and task were fixed effects, and Subject ID, MRI session, and head motion were random effects. Wild bootstrapping in combination with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was employed to estimate p-values for t-statistic maps resulting from the LME model. To perform the analysis, a wild bootstrapping procedure was implemented, which involved resampling clusters or groups of observations rather than individual data points. A large number of bootstrap samples (B=1,000) were generated using the Rademacher procedure66, where the residuals were randomly inverted to disrupt any potential autocorrelation. Specifically, a Rademacher vector was generated by randomly assigning −1 or 1 values with equal probability to each observation’s residual. By element-wise multiplication of the original residuals with the Rademacher vector, bootstrap samples were created to capture the variability in the data. For each bootstrap sample, the TFCE algorithm was applied to enhance the sensitivity to clusters of significant voxels or regions while controlling for multiple comparisons. The value of the enhanced cluster statistic, derived from the bootstrap samples, was used to create a null distribution under the null hypothesis. By comparing the original observed cluster statistic with the null distribution, p-values were derived to quantify the statistical significance of the observed effect. The p-values were obtained based on the proportion of bootstrap samples that produced a maximum cluster statistic exceeding the observed cluster statistic. Significance thresholds were determined using alpha = 0.05 to control for the family-wise error rate. The combined approach of wild bootstrapping with the Rademacher procedure and TFCE provided a robust and data-driven method to generate p-values for neuroimaging data. This methodology accounted for the complex correlation structure, effectively controlled for multiple comparisons, and accommodated potential autocorrelation in the residuals through the Rademacher procedure. By incorporating these techniques, significant effects of psilocybin and other conditions were reliably identified amidst noise and spatial dependencies.  For analyses in Figs. 1b, 2, S2, S3, distance calculations were computed at the parcel level. The effects of day-to-day, drug condition (baseline, psilocybin, between, MTP, after), task, and head motion and their interactions were directly examined by calculating the distance between each functional network matrix. RMS Euclidean distance was computed between the linearized upper triangles of the parcellated FC matrix between each pair of 15-minute fMRI scans, creating a second-order ‘‘distance” matrix (Fig. S2). In this analysis, the two task sessions were concatenated to match the length of the 15-minute rest runs. Subsequently, the average distance was examined for functional network matrices that were (1) from the same individual within a single session, (2) from the same individual across days (‘‘day-to-day”), (3) from the same subject between drug and baseline (e.g. ‘‘PSIL v Base”), (4) from the same individual but different tasks (‘‘task:rest”), (5) from the same individual between highest motion scans and baseline (“hi:lo motion”), (6) from different individuals (“between person”). Post-hoc comparison between drug conditions was conducted using two-tailed t tests. A related approach using z-transformed Pearson correlation (‘similarity’ rather than distance) was also taken and results were unchanged (Fig. S2c).  The different conditions above were compared by calculating whole brain network change magnitudes as shown in Figs. 1b, S2, and S3c. These are reported in the text as normalized network change scores calculated using the following procedure: We (i) determined network change for each condition compared to baseline as described above, (ii) subtracted within-session distance for all conditions (such that within-session network change = 0), (iii) divided all conditions by day-to-day distance (such that day-to-day network change = 1). Thus, normalized whole brain network change values (e.g. PSIL v Base = 4.58) could be thought of as proportional to day-to-day variability.  We used a classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach to cluster brain networks across fMRI sessions, as described by Gratton and colleagues24. This data driven approach was used to identify how different parameters (e.g. task, drug, individual) affect similarity/distance between networks. MDS places data in multidimensional space based on the similarity (Euclidean distance; correlation-based distances produce similar results) among data points – where in this case a data point represents the linearized upper triangle of a given functional network matrix. Each separate matrix (from a given subject, task, and session) was entered into the classical MDS algorithm (implemented using MATLAB 2019, cmdscale.m). Multiple dimensions of the data were explored. The eigenvectors were multiplied by the original FC matrices to generate a matrix of eigen-weights that corresponded to each dimension.  To assess network specificity of vertex-wise PSIL network change values, we calculated average network change of matched null networks consisting of randomly rotated networks with preserved size, shape, and relative position to each other. Following Gordon & Laumann et al., 2016, we employed a rotation-based null model, in which a subject’s subnetworks were iteratively rotated a random amount around the spherical expansion of the cortical surface. The spatial autocorrelation of smoothed BOLD data means that small networks are more likely to contain a single connectivity pattern than large networks. To create such matched random networks, we rotated each hemisphere of the original networks a random amount around the x, y, and z axes on the spherical expansion of the cortical surface. This procedure randomly relocated each network while maintaining networks’ size, shape, and relative positions to each other. Random rotation followed be computation of RSN-average PSIL network change score was repeated 1000 times to generate null distributions of network change scores. Vertices rotated into the medial wall were not included in the calculation. Actual PSIL network change score was then compared to null rotation permutations to generate a p-value for each of 12 systems (resting state networks) that were consistently present across every subject’s infomap parcellation. For bar graph visualization of ‘PSIL Change by System’ (Figs. 1, S3), RSNs with greater change (p<0.05 based on null rotation permutations) are shown their respective color (as indicated in Fig. S3) and all other RSNs are shown in gray. We used a n approach previously validated to assess spatial complexity (termed entropy) or neural signals39. Temporal principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the full BOLD dense timeseries, which yielded m principal components (m = ~80K surface vertices and subcortical voxels) and associated eigenvalues. The normalized eigenvalue of the i -th principal component was calculated as where m was the number of principal components, λ i and λ i represented the eigenvalue and the normalized eigenvalue of the i -th principal component respectively. Lastly, the NGSC, defined as the normalized entropy of normalized eigenvalues, was computed using the equation:  The NGSC computed above attains values from the interval 0 to 1. The lowest value NGSC=0 would mean the brain-wide BOLD signal consisted of exactly one principal component or spatial mode, and there is maximum global functional connectivity between all vertices. The highest value NGSC=1 would mean the total data variance is uniformly distributed across all m principal components, and a maximum spatial complexity or a lowest functional connectivity is found. To assess if persistent effects of psychedelics, we compared network changes 1–21 days post-psilocybin to pre-drug baseline. The network change analysis (described above) indicated that connectivity at the ‘whole brain’ level did not change following psilocybin (Fig. S2 and S3). A screen was conducted with p>0.05 threshold to identify brain systems or areas showing persisting effects. This analysis identified the anterior hippocampus as a candidate region of interest (ROI) for persisting FC change (see ‘Pre/Post Psilocybin Network Change Analysis’ in Extended Data). We assessed anterior hippocampus FC globally with cortex and specifically with the DMN. A bilateral anterior hippocampus ROI was used to generate a cortex-wide FC seed map for every session. Root-mean-square FC was computer to generate global FC67. Global FC was compared between pre-psilocybin sessions and post-psilocybin using a linear mixed effects model described above (drug condition and task were fixed effects, and Subject ID, MRI session, and head motion were random effects). Post-hoc visualization and timecourses were generated for FC with individual-defined default mode network. Raw fMRI and structural data from (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012) and (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) were run through our in-house registration and processing pipeline described above. These datasets were used for replication, external validation, and generalization to another classic psychedelic (i.e., LSD) for the measures described above (e.g., normalized global spatial complexity, and the MDS-derived psilocybin FC dimension (Dimension 1). Carhart-Harris et al., 2012: N=15 healthy adults completed two scanning sessions (psilocybin and saline) which included eyes-closed resting state BOLD scan for 6 minutes prior to and following I.V. infusion of drug. fMRI data were acquired using a gradient- echo EPI sequence, TR/TE 3000/35 ms, field-of-view = 192 mm, 64 × 64 acquisition matrix, parallel acceleration factor = 2, 90° flip angle.

Taking a weight-loss drug reduced a craving for opioids,"Taking a weight-loss drug reduced a craving for opioids  Every print subscription comes with full digital access Early results provide some evidence that drugs like Wegovy can tackle opioid addiction, too Preliminary results from a small clinical trial suggest that liraglutide, a drug used to treat diabetes and obesity, could also be an effective treatment for substance use disorders. Saxenda (shown) is one of the brand names under which liraglutide is sold. CRISTIANCAMILOACEVEDOOROZCO/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS By Erin Garcia de Jesús FEBRUARY 17, 2024 AT 8:20 PM DENVER — A weight-loss drug used to treat obesity and diabetes has shown promise to treat another disorder: opioid addiction.   Early results from a small clinical trial, presented February 17 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, suggest that a close relative of the weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic significantly lessened cravings for opioids in people with opioid use disorder. “For them to have any time when they might be free of that craving seems to be very hopeful,” Patricia “Sue” Grigson, a behavioral neuroscientist at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey said at the conference. The vast majority of drug overdose deaths in the United States are due to opioids (SN: 2/14/24). Science News is collecting reader questions about how to navigate our planet's changing climate. What do you want to know about extreme heat and how it can lead to extreme weather events? The drug, called liraglutide, mimics a hormone called GLP-1 that the body releases after people eat. Wegovy and Ozempic — brand names for semaglutide, a molecule that induces weight loss more effectively than liraglutide — also imitate the hormone.  It’s unclear exactly how the drugs work when it comes to weight loss, but researchers think such GLP-1 dupes prompt the body and brain to make people feel full (SN: 12/13/23).  There are hints that such drugs could work for addiction, too. People taking Wegovy or Ozempic have reported lessened desire for not just food but also alcohol and nicotine. What’s more, Grigson and colleagues showed in a previous study in rats that liraglutide can cut down on heroin-seeking behavior, perhaps by changing the animals’ brain activity (SN: 8/30/23).   To test whether liraglutide might work in people as a treatment for opioid addiction, Grigson and colleagues gave the drug to volunteers being treated for opioid use disorder at the Caron Treatment Center in Wernersville, Pa. The team analyzed data from 20 people, 10 of whom were slated to receive increasing drug doses over 19 days. The remaining 10 people received a placebo.    At higher doses of liraglutide, patients dropped out of the trial largely due to gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, a known side effect of these drugs. Still, the treatment began reducing opioid cravings at the lowest dose, Grigson said, and desire for opioids was reduced by 30 percent overall.  That’s equivalent to the effect of about 14 days of intensive treatment at a residential center, Grigson said. The results need to be confirmed in larger trials, she said. The team also hopes to try out other GLP-1 drugs, which may be more effective and come with fewer side effects, and include people with different levels of addiction.

Spain beats France to reach Euro 2024 final after goal from 16-year-old Lamine Yamal,"Spain 2-1 France: La Roja fight back to reach final  Tuesday, July 9, 2024  Spain recovered from a goal down to edge past France and book their place in the EURO 2024 final.  Spain are through to the UEFA EURO 2024 final after coming from behind to defeat France in Munich. Key moments 5': Fabián Ruiz heads Yamal cross over bar 9': Kolo Muani opens scoring from Mbappé delivery 21': Magnificent Yamal strike restores parity 25': Olmo puts Spain ahead with low drive 48': Maignan darts off line to thwart Williams 76': Hernández blazes over bar from inside box 86': Mbappé misses target from edge of area This heavyweight match-up pitted the tournament's joint-highest goalscorers against the lowest scorers left in the competition, so it came as little surprise that in-form Spain went closest to taking an early lead. Lamine Yamal – the youngest-ever player to appear in a EURO or FIFA World Cup semi-final – delivered an exquisite ball towards the far post, but Fabián Ruiz was unable to steer his header on target. Undeterred, France responded with the opening goal of the game just four minutes later. Kylian Mbappé collected the ball on the left side of the penalty area before lifting a tantalising cross onto the head of Randal Kolo Muani, who nodded in Les Bleus' fourth goal of the tournament from close range. Just over a quarter of an hour later, however, Spain had not only restored parity but completed the turnaround. After picking up the ball outside the France penalty box, Yamal drew Spain level with a glorious curling finish to become the youngest goalscorer in EURO history. Dani Olmo – who scored one and assisted another against Germany in the quarter-finals – then struck again four minutes after Yamal's strike, his low drive deflecting off defender Jules Koundé on its way past goalkeeper Mike Maignan. Maignan had to be on his toes to deny Nico Williams an open goal not long after the restart, darting off his line to dispossess the forward with a perfectly-timed sliding challenge. France remained a threat at the other end, though, and Unai Simón needed to stick out a strong left arm to keep out Ousmane Dembélé's shot from a tight angle just before the hour mark. There were to be few other clear-cut openings for the EURO 2016 finalists. Theo Hernández spurned their best chance to equalise with a quarter of an hour remaining, blazing over the crossbar after connecting with a loose ball inside the area. Mbappé also went close with a fizzing drive that evaded the bar, but there was no late reprieve for Didier Deschamps' team as Spain held on to reach their fifth EURO showpiece. ""His fantastic equaliser was crucial in Spain coming back into the game. At such a young age, he works hard defensively and is a threat on the ball, impressing with his positioning and forming a productive partnership with Jesús Navas on the right."" UEFA Technical Observer panel A seismic match at a tournament full of wonderful moments. I expect neutrals all over the world were glued to this contest. It was sweaty, tense and all-in here. I don't think anyone doubted that Yamal was the real deal but, honestly, to be here and watch him was simply a joy. It all started so well for Deschamps' team after Kolo Muani's early header, but even Les Bleus' stingy defence were unable to keep Spain's prolific attack at bay. France exit the competition with their heads held high, but this was La Roja's night.  Luis de la Fuente, Spain coach: ""I have to keep my faith in this group of players. They always work for the common good. They're very generous with their work rate. It's just another sign that this is an insatiable team. I'm grateful for being able to lead 26 geniuses on the pitch."" Lamine Yamal, Vivo Player of the Match: ""I'm thrilled that we are in the final, but we still haven't done the most important thing, which is win this. There were difficult moments for us out there. None of us expected to concede that early. [For my goal] I was aiming for exactly the top corner where my shot went in. It was a feeling of pure elation."" Dani Olmo, Spain midfielder: ""We just need to take one more step now. It's unbelievable. We deserve to be in the final. It was unfortunate [to fall behind] but we never gave up and kept going. Lamine scored an incredible goal. It doesn't matter who we play in the final."" Nacho, Spain defender: ""We knew that there were genius players in the French team, but we knew that we were as good as them. So when we were losing, and looking for a solution, up popped the youngest man in our team with a fantastic goal."" Didier Deschamps, France coach: ""We were able to open the scoring, which was great. Spain mastered the game better than us, though. We didn't perform that well, we didn't play as vertically as I wanted. We pushed all the way to the end."" William Saliba, France defender: ""We're disappointed because we could have done better. We scored first, but after that we gave them two goals. Honestly, they were better than us and we have to accept that. It's hard but that's how it is. We gave everything to get back into it, but it didn't happen.""

Female boxers Lin Yu-ting and Imane Khelif both previously failed a gender eligibility test but have been cleared to compete at Paris 2024,"Boxing's gender row - what's going on and are Russia involved?  Lin Yu-ting and Imane Khelif are guaranteed a medal at Paris 2024 Boxing at Paris 2024 has been overshadowed by a row about the eligibility of two fighters in the women's competition. Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwanese fighter Lin Yu-ting will fight for gold on Friday and Saturday respectively. But last year they were disqualified from the World Championships. The body that oversaw that 2023 event is the International Boxing Association (IBA), and it says both fighters failed gender eligibility tests. On Monday the IBA held a news conference which it had said would provide a ""detailed explanation of the reasons for the disqualification"". However the chaotic media event left more questions than answers. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has cast doubt on the reliability of the tests and suggested what is happening is a ""sometimes politically motivated cultural war"". In June 2023, the IOC stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's amateur world governing body over concerns over how it was run. So, what is going on? IBA holds chaotic news conference on Olympic boxing row The IBA, formerly known as AIBA, was formed in 1946 as a worldwide governing body for amateur boxing. The IOC recognised the IBA as the sport's governing body until 2019. The IOC suspended the IBA in 2019. This was because of governance issues and alleged corruption. It led to the threat that boxing would be removed from the Olympics altogether from 2028. In 2018, the IBA issued life bans to ex-president CK Wu and former executive director Ho Kim after a report documented ""gross negligence and financial mismanagement of affairs and finances"". Wu had been in charge for 11 years before being provisionally suspended in October 2017. Wu was replaced as AIBA president by Gafur Rakhimov, who was described by the US Treasury Department as ""one of Uzbekistan's leading criminals"". In 2020, Russian Umar Kremlev was elected president. In 2022, an independent investigation said boxing needed to take action on ethical issues to secure its Olympic future, having found a ""historical culture of bout manipulation"" - including at the 2016 Rio Games. In his final report, Professor Richard McLaren detailed decades of financial mismanagement and deception, rule-breaking in the ring, and inadequate training and education programmes for referees, judges and officials. Kremlev pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the country's newly opened international boxing centre in September 2022 Kremlev is seen as having close ties to the Kremlin. Under his leadership, the IBA has had Russian state-backed energy giant Gazprom among its chief sponsors. In May 2022, Kremlev was re-elected unopposed after Dutch boxing federation president Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) later said Van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing, but a proposal to stage a new election was rejected by IBA delegates. The IOC said it was ""extremely concerned"" by the result, and Van der Vorst said he feared for the sport's Olympic future. The 2023 World Championships were held in two countries. The women's event was in India in March, and the men's in Uzbekistan in April and May. A total of 19 countries, including Great Britain and the USA, boycotted the events after the IBA allowed Russian and Belarusian boxers to compete under their countries' flags, contravening IOC guidance following the invasion of Ukraine. Kremlev said those boycotting the championships were ""worse than hyenas and jackals"" because of their violation of the ""integrity of sport and culture"". At the time, GB Boxing said of its decision to boycott the championships that the flag issues had ""put further distance between IBA and the Olympic movement in addition to the significant, longstanding issues over sporting integrity, governance, transparency and financial management which the IOC has asked IBA to address to protect boxing's place on the Olympic programme"". Russian athletes such as boxer Azalia Amineva are prevented from competing at Paris 2024 for their country. No Russian boxers are at the Games as neutral athletes. At the 2023 World Championships, Khelif was competing in the welterweight category and Lin at featherweight. Hours before Khelif's gold-medal match against China’s Yang Liu, the IBA said the Algerian had failed a gender eligibility test. Khelif had beaten Janjaem Suwannapheng from Thailand in the semi-final, Uzbekistan's Navbakhor Khamidova in the quarter-final and Russia's Azalia Amineva in the round prior to that. As a result of Khelif's disqualification, 21-year-old Amineva had the only loss in her now 22-fight career removed from the record. At the same 2023 World Championships, Lin was stripped of a bronze medal by the IBA. The IBA said the fighters had ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations"". The BBC has, as yet, been unable to determine what the eligibility tests consisted of. It is not known how tests were overseen. In an interview with BBC sports editor Dan Roan last Thursday, IBA chief executive Chris Roberts said male XY chromosomes were found in ""both cases"". Roberts said there were ""different strands involved in that"" and therefore the body could not commit to referring to the fighters as ""biologically male"". He said the unspecified eligibility tests had been conducted as a result of “ongoing concerns” raised by other fighters, coaches and the IBA’s medical committee. At Monday's media event Roberts said Khelif and Lin were first tested at the 2022 World Championships in Istanbul, Turkey but no action was taken as the results were ""inconclusive"". Of the fighters' 2023 disqualifications, he said: ""The results of the chromosome tests demonstrated both boxers were ineligible."" But while Roberts said the pair had ""chromosome tests"", Kremlev appeared to suggest the tests were to determine the fighters' testosterone levels. Testosterone is a hormone that can increase muscle mass and strength. Chromosomes carry genetic information including a person’s sex. ""We got the test results that they allowed us to make and these test results show they have high levels of testosterone, like men, said Kremlev. He added that if boxers ""want to prove they were born women, they have to do it by themselves"". The IBA said the tests were sent to two different laboratories that are accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). However, Wada has told BBC Sport it does not oversee gender tests and its work only relates to anti-doping matters. The IOC has previously raised doubts over the accuracy of the tests. ""We don't know what the protocol was, we don't know whether the test was accurate, we don't know whether we should believe the test,"" said IOC spokesperson Mark Adams. ""There's a difference between a test taking place and whether we accept the accuracy or even the protocol of the test."" Imane Khelif: IOC responds to boxing gender controversy In a statement lastThursday, the IOC said Khelif and Lin had been ""victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA"". ""Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process,"" the IOC said. ""According to the IBA minutes available on their website, this decision was initially taken solely by the IBA secretary general and CEO. The IBA board only ratified it afterwards and only subsequently requested that a procedure to follow in similar cases in the future be established and reflected in the IBA regulations. The minutes also say that the IBA should 'establish a clear procedure on gender testing'. ""The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure - especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years. ""Such an approach is contrary to good governance."" The IBA insisted its decision was ""necessary to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition"". It said in a statement last week: ""The athletes did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test, whereby the specifics remain confidential. This test conclusively indicated that both athletes did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors."" The IBA said Lin did not ultimately appeal against the IBA's decision to Cas, while Khelif withdrew an appeal, ""thus rendering the decisions legally binding"". In June 2023, 69 of 70 Olympic federations voted to strip the IBA of its status. Before the vote, IOC president Thomas Bach said: ""We do not have a problem with boxing. We do not have a problem with boxers. ""The boxers fully deserve to be governed by an international federation with integrity and transparency."" In response, the IBA accused the IOC of making a ""tremendous error"" and compared the move to Germany's actions in World War Two. An IBA statement read: ""We have successfully implemented all recommendations outlined by the IOC in its roadmap. ""Despite the challenges, the IBA remains committed to the development of boxing and the organisation of official tournaments and world boxing championships at the highest level. ""We cannot conceal the fact that today's decision is catastrophic for global boxing and blatantly contradicts the IOC's claims of acting in the best interests of boxing and athletes."" Cas rejected an appeal by the IBA against the decision. A new body, World Boxing, was set up in April 2023. Among five pledges, the new organisation says it will ""keep boxing at the heart of the Olympic movement"" and ""ensure the interests of boxers are put first"". One of its key goals is maintaining boxing as an Olympic sport after it was provisionally dropped from the 2028 Games over the IBA issues. However, it remains in discussions with the IOC to get recognition as the worldwide governing body for the sport. It is backed by representatives from Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Sweden and the United States. The IBA has previously said it ""strongly condemns"" the establishment of a ""rogue"" organisation, adding it has ""initiated a series of actions to protect its autonomy as the official worldwide governing body"". Unlike previous Games, boxing at the Tokyo Olympics was organised by the IOC rather than the IBA. In 2019, the IOC delegated responsibility for the organisation and management of doping control at the Olympics to the International Testing Agency (ITA). The IOC said it took a ""zero-tolerance policy"" to anyone found using or providing doping products. Tests include, but are not excluded to, determining an athlete's levels of testosterone. In late 2021 the IOC issued new guidance on transgender athletes in women’s sport. This placed the responsibility on individual federations to determine eligibility criteria in their sport. The framework came in the aftermath of Tokyo 2020 when weightlifter Laurel Hubbard became the first transgender athlete to compete at the Olympics in a different gender category to that in which they were born. While the IOC said there should be no assumption that a transgender athlete automatically has an unfair advantage in female events, it issued a 10-point document that it expected every sport to apply before Paris 2024. Since then many sports have banned transgender women from taking part in women's sport, such as athletics, aquatics and both rugby codes. However, the rules have been applied differently so there are sports in which transgender women or athletes with differences of sex development (DSD) can compete. Boxing is one of those as the IOC, which has been overseeing Olympic boxing, has not updated the eligibility criteria rules since Tokyo 2020. In boxing the IOC said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female. The IOC said it ""supports the participation of any athlete who has qualified and met the eligibility criteria to compete in the Olympic Games as established by their IF (international federation). The IOC will not discriminate against an athlete who has qualified through their IF, on the basis of their gender identity and/or sex characteristics"".  Both cases had been reported on last year around the World Championships, although not widely in Europe or the US given the boycotts of the event. The IOC included the details on the media information portal before Paris 2024, although that was later removed. Given heightened scrutiny around women's sport and transgender athletes or people with DSD, media picked up on the IOC saying athletes who had failed the tests were due to compete in the women’s division. Since then the IOC has insisted the fighters were ""born women and raised women"", but the IBA has continued to insist its tests suggest their eligibility for women’s boxing is in question.

In the final, Hodgkinson led the race from early on, breaking away in the final 100 metres, and beating Ethiopia’s Tsige Duguma and Kenya’s reigning World and Commonwealth Games champion, Mary Moraa. She is a four-time British national senior champion. Hodgkinson was born on 3 March 2002 in Atherton, Greater Manchester, and brought up there.[8] Her mother Rachel trained for a time with Leigh Harriers while her father Dean had run in the London Marathon in the past.[9][3] Hodgkinson graduated from Fred Longworth High School in Tyldesley and Loughborough College in Leicestershire.[10][11] In 2020, she became a student of criminology at Leeds Beckett University, and took a gap year in 2021.[3][12] Hodgkinson joined Leigh Harriers at the age of nine, but initially swam with Howe Bridge Aces before devoting herself fully to running.[13][14] She first made an impression aged barely 10, in 2012. Competing among 70 finalists at the British Schools Modern Biathlon Championships in London, Hodgkinson finished second in the 500 metres run with a personal best (1:34.28) and also swam 50 m with a new best as well for an overall eighth place.[15] Her father advised her to run, and she was inspired by British heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill winning the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics.[16][17] From that point, Keely won many age-group titles and minor medals, culminating in her winning at age 16 European Under-18 and England U20 titles, and, after an injury-affected winter, European U20 bronze a year later. In 2013, still aged 10, she already had an unbeaten streak of 14 running events. In winning a one-mile cross country course she became the first Leigh Harriers girl to claim the individual U11 girls' title in both the South East Lancashire League and the Red Rose League.[18] About two weeks later, she ran her 16th undefeated race, winning a 2 km course with the lead of 45 seconds.[19] On the track, as a first-year U13, she became double Greater Manchester champion at the 800 and 1200 metres.[4] In 2014, the then 12-year-old won all her 13 track races (across 800–1500 metres events, with a 4:47 best at the latter) as well as many cross country competitions.[4] She took her third Greater Manchester title on a 2.75 km cross country course and later defended both her track titles, breaking championship records – the latter of which had stood since 1985.[20][21] Her U13 1200 m best was bettered only in 2019, remaining, as of 2023, the third-fastest on the respective British girl's all-time list.[4] In 2015, she had to limit training and starts due to a mastoidectomy surgery to remove a tumour on her ear, which has left her 95% deaf in this ear, followed by problems with knees.[22] The following year the youngster finished third in the U15 800 metres events at both the ESAA English Schools' Championships and England Athletics Championships. Around that period she began to specialise in this distance while still running cross country.[4][23][3] Hodgkinson rebounded the following year, in 2017, when the then 15-year-old raced the 800 metres already in the U17 age category. Although initially fourth at the ESAA Championships, she went on to take her first gold medal at the England Championships, setting a lifetime best (2:06.85),[5] before adding the 1500 m (UK) School Games title.[24] In June 2018, at 16, Hodgkinson became the England U20 800 m champion.[25] The next month, she won the gold medal at the European Athletics U18 Championships held in Győr, Hungary, breaking the championship record in the process with a time of 2:04.84.[26][3] In August, she added titles at the England U17s and at the (UK) School Games with a competition record.[5][27] Named by Wigan Borough Council Sports Achiever of the Year, her season's best ranked her, at the time, fifth on the British U17 female all-time list (2:04.26).[4][28] Her 2019 athletics year was affected by shin problems for most of the winter. Despite this and competing against athletes up to two years her senior, she placed second at the England U20s and earned bronze at the European U20 Championships in Borås, Sweden, setting a new personal best.[29][30][5] On 1 February, still only 17, Hodgkinson set the second-fastest female U20 performance ever in the indoor 800 m at the Vienna Indoor Classic in Austria. Clocking a European U20 record of 2:01.16 for a win in her international debut at senior level, just 0.13 s off the world U20 standard, she broke Kirsty Wade's long-standing 1981 British U20 record (2:02.88), and Aníta Hinriksdóttir's continental best for the age group set in 2015 by 0.4 seconds.[31][32] The same month, she went on to take her first national senior title at the British Indoor Championships. At the end of August, she debuted outdoors at international senior level in Gothenburg, Sweden, finishing with a new PB behind only the 2019 world silver medallist Raevyn Rogers.[33] In this Covid-affected season, in September, the 18-year-old claimed also the British outdoor title to become the youngest winner over 800 m since 1974.[34][35] She improved her PB further with a time of 2:01.73, when ending her season in Rovereto, Italy (5th) three days later.[36] Hodgkinson's breakthrough year began with the first British women's world U20 record for 36 years.[37] Hodgkinson returned to Vienna on 30 January, after Covid-induced travel complications, and that same day, she won for the second consecutive year with a time of 1:59.03 – her first result under 2 minutes, making her the first junior woman in history to break this mark in the indoor 800 m. She obliterated by exactly two seconds previous best set by Ethiopia's Meskerem Legesse in 2004.[38] However, Hodgkinson's contemporary Athing Mu, USA's rising talent, improved the new record the following month (1:58.40).[39] On Hodgkinson's senior major championship debut, four days after her 19th birthday, she became the youngest British winner at the European Athletics Indoor Championships for more than half a century and the youngest ever women's 800 m European indoor champion after a tactical win over a quality field in Toruń, Poland. Only Marilyn Neufville has been a younger UK gold medallist when winning the 400 metres in 1970 at age 17, while Hodgkinson was younger than fellow Briton Jane Colebrook, who became the then-youngest European 800 m champion in 1977.[40][41] In May, Keely secured her first major international outdoor victory at the Golden Spike in Ostrava, Czechia posting for the first time sub-2 minute mark outdoors with 1:58.89 as she broke by almost a second long-standing UK junior record of Charlotte Moore. While not the fastest European U20 women's result, officially it was also the European junior record, beating Birte Bruhns' standard of 1:59.17 set in 1988.[42][43] At the end of June, she sealed a place in the British team for the Tokyo Olympics by defending her title at the Nationals which doubled as the Olympic trials, outsprinting experienced Scottish duo Laura Muir and Jemma Reekie on the final straight.[44][45][46] A week later, she set a British U23 record by lowering her PB to 1:57.51 when finishing fourth at the Stockholm Diamond League meet.[47] ""If the Olympics had been last year I wouldn't have been here, but suddenly it's given me a year to grow and compete with these girls."" – Hodgkinson on her silver medal at the postponed 2020 Tokyo Olympics held in 2021.[48] Before the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in August she ranked eighth on the season's top list and fifth among women entered.[49][50] She placed second in her heat and then won her semi-final with the fourth-fastest time of the semis. In the final, Hodgkinson blitzed to the silver medal, taking almost two seconds off her fresh personal best and almost six seconds off her pre-2021 best with a time of one minute 55.88 seconds, finishing behind only Athing Mu who clocked 1:55.21. Hodgkinson broke Kelly Holmes' 26-year-old British record of 1:56.21, beating the European U20 best (1:57.45) dating back to 1978.[51][52][48] She also set a continental U23 record.[53] On her return to the Diamond circuit, the Briton came fifth in USA's Eugene in Oregon, then second in Brussels, and ended the season with a 1:57.98 victory at the Zürich final in September, winning her first Diamond League race and first Diamond Trophy.[5][54][55] Funded before 2021 by her parents who have also three other children, until October she had no support from UK Athletics which, possibly due to the pandemic, did not make any changes to its funding list the previous year.[56] She was backed by businessman Barrie Wells, who had previously helped fund 18 athletes to the 2012 London Olympics; he matched her £15,000 a year Lottery funding, allowing for spring warm-weather training in Florida. Hodgkinson is one of Wells Trust's athlete ambassadors.[57][58] That year was very packed and demanding for still very young athlete, including World Indoor Championships in March and three major outdoor championships in just a one-month span in the summer.[59] On the heels of a successful 2021 season, Hodgkinson opened her athletics year on 19 February with the fastest indoor 800 m performance by a woman in 20 years of 1:57.20, at the Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix. It was the quickest mark since the precise day she was born, when the world record was set. She established the British record, all-comers' record (best performance on country's soil), the fastest ever mark by a teenager, and the sixth-fastest indoor mark of all time.[60][61] Heading to the World Indoors in Belgrade Hodgkinson was a red-hot favourite. However, she had to withdraw from the competition after warm-up on site due to a quad injury.[62] The 20-year-old kickstarted her summer season on 21 May on the Diamond League circuit, with a victory in her specialist event in Birmingham.[63] She then continued competition in the Diamond Race, winning in Eugene behind the pond, Oslo, and coming home second behind Kenya's Mary Moraa in Stockholm.[5] Ahead of the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, first year seniors Mu and Hodgkinson looked favourites, though the latter was fourth on the season's outdoor top list. Third place was occupied by Moraa, two years older, who had exited in the semis at the Tokyo Olympics the previous year.[64] It was a very tense battle for the line against Mu this time, in the final straight, at the World Championships in July. After one of the most thrilling finishes of the Worlds, Hodgkinson came only 0.08 s behind her to claim the silver medal with a season's best of 1:56.38, comfortably ahead of Moraa (1:56.71).[65][66] Less than two weeks later at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games, she was unexpectedly defeated by fast-finishing Moraa earning also a silver, 1:57.40 to 1:57.07.[67] The same August, she responded to the setbacks and secured her first major senior outdoor gold, winning convincingly her two-lap event at the European Championships held in Munich.[68][69] Concluding this busy athletics year she struggled to maintain her form, and had to settle for fifth at the Zürich Diamond League final in September.[70] However, Hodgkinson's Birmingham indoor mark made her the world leader for the season with a nearly 1.3-second advantage, while her result from the Worlds final ranked second outdoors that year.[71][72] ""This one is definitely for him. He had a lot of belief in little 10-year-old me [...]. I hope to make him really proud and I know he will be up there watching [...]."" – Hodgkinson dedicated her third European title to her first coach in athletics, who had died before the championships.[74][75] 2022 saw the emergence of new rival for Hodgkinson as Moraa, defeated by the Briton at the World Championships, entered Mu–Hodgkinson equation. Keely got her 2023 campaign off to strong start on 28 January on the home turf of Manchester. She set a world indoor best in the less frequently run distance of 600 metres with a time of 1:23.41, beating Olga Kotlyarova's record set in 2004 by 0.03 s.[76][77] Hodgkinson then won for the first time and decisively the World Indoor Tour in her 800 m category, prevailing in all her races. She took victories in Toruń again (meet record of 1:57.87), Liévin in France (competing against Moraa and dominating over her in those two) and Tour Final in Birmingham, where she slightly improved her own UK indoor record with 1:57.18.[78][79][80] The Mancunian rounded off her indoor season with a successful, commanding defence of her European title at Istanbul 2023. She dedicated the win to her first coach in athletics, Joe Galvin, who had died a few days earlier.[81][75] Outdoors, the 21-year-old began with an emphatic victory at the Paris Diamond League on 9 June, breaking her British record by 0.11 s in a time of 1:55.77.[82][83] Working on her speed, she competed in and won the 400 metres at the England U23s with a new PB. She then lost800 to often unpredictable Moraa at the Lausanne Diamond League in Switzerland, and took800 her fourth British title. Having been appointed UK team co-captain at the European U23 Championships held in Espoo, Finland, where she competed in the 400 m, Hodgkinson went on to secure bronze, clocking a new PB again (51.76).[84][5] Later she missed the sold-out, with over 50,000 native crowd, London Diamond League, would be her debut at the Olympic Stadium, due to an illness.[85] At the World Championships held that year in Budapest, the ""Big Three"" grabbed all the medals again in one of the event's most highly anticipated showdowns. The Briton snuck through inside in the final straight to defeat Mu for the first time, but could not overhaul Moraa in the last metres, finishing second in 1:56.34 with almost exactly 0.3 s separating her from both Moraa (1:56.03) and Mu (1:56.61).[86] Hodgkinson rebounded at the Eugene Diamond League final, front-running for almost the entire distance to claim her second Diamond Trophy and improve massively her own UK record with a time of 1:55.19, an almost 0.6 s progress. Though she beat Moraa, the race was narrowly won, however, in turn by Mu who competed as an ineligible national wild card and set a US record (1:54.97).[87][88] Thus, as in the previous year, Hodgkinson definitely led the season's indoor top list and was second on the outdoor one. Hodgkinson opened her 2024 season by running a 400 metres personal best of 51.61 s at a meeting in Citta di Savona, Italy, on 15 May finishing second behind Ireland's Sharlene Mawdsley.[89] In her first 800 metres of the season at the Diamond League Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon, USA, on 25 May, Hodgkinson surged past world champion Mary Moraa with 150 metres to go and stretched clear to win in a world lead time of 1:55.78.[90] Hodgkinson won gold at the 2024 European Athletics Championships in Rome, Italy, retaining the title she won two years previously.[91] At the Diamond League meeting in London on 20 July, Hodgkinson set a new British 800m record of 1:54:61 to become the sixth fastest woman in history over the distance.[92][93][94] At the 2024 Paris Olympics, Hodgkinson clinched the gold medal in the women's 800m final with a time of 1:56.72.[95][96][97][98] On 21 August, she announced she would miss the rest of the season due to injury.[99][100] Information taken from World Athletics profile unless otherwise noted.[5] Last updated on 15 May 2024. 800 metres wins, other events specified in parentheses.

Orlando Magic co-founder Pat Williams dies at 84,"Orlando Magic Co-Founder and Sports Legend Pat Williams Passes Away at 84  ORLANDO — Orlando Magic co-founder, hall of famer, and sports legend Pat Williams died peacefully today surrounded by family. He was 84. The cause of death was complications from viral pneumonia. Williams’ career spanned more than 56 years, including 30-plus years with the Orlando Magic and 51 years in the NBA. “Pat Williams simply brought magic to Orlando,” said Orlando Magic Chairman Dan DeVos and CEO Alex Martins in a joint statement. “His accomplishments will always be remembered. Armed with his ever-present optimism and unparalleled energy, he was an incredible visionary who helped transform the world of sports in multiple ways. From bringing the Magic to Orlando, to transforming sports marketing and promotions, he was always ahead of the curve. Pat forever changed the sports landscape in Orlando. He shined a light on what those who called Orlando home already knew – that Central Florida was a fabulous place to live, work and play. We all owe him a debt of gratitude and he will certainly be missed, but never forgotten."" More than 35 years ago, it was Williams who turned a dream into the Orlando Magic. Williams, along with local businessman Jimmy Hewitt, began the process of bringing an NBA team to Orlando in 1986. On April 22, 1987, the NBA Board of Governors granted an expansion franchise to Orlando, and on December 22, 1988, the Magic sold their 10,000th season ticket, thus fulfilling their commitment to the NBA and the Magic were born. Williams spent well over four decades in the NBA, starting his basketball career with the Philadelphia 76ers as the club's business manager in 1968. He followed that with his first general manager role in the NBA joining the Chicago Bulls as their GM at the tender age of 29. He remained a general manager in the league for 27 years in stints with the Bulls, Hawks and Sixers, playing a major role in bringing the NBA title to Philadelphia in 1983. Williams served as the Magic's GM until 1996 when he was promoted to his post of senior vice president. Williams' first love was baseball, the sport that earned him a scholarship to Wake Forest University. While at Wake Forest, he earned a bachelor’s degree in physical education. He was a three-year letterman as a catcher on the Demon Deacons baseball team and is a member of the Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame. He later went on to earn a master’s of science degree in physical education from Indiana University in 1964. Williams’ baseball career began when he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1962 and spent two seasons catching for the Miami Marlins, a Class A club in the Florida State League. He quickly moved from the playing field to the front office, when he was appointed business manager of Miami in 1964. He took the general manager job with the Spartanburg (S.C.) Phillies in 1965 and was later elevated to the position of president of the organization in 1967. In 1967, he was chosen the Minor League Executive of the Year by The Sporting News. Williams remains active in baseball as a catcher in Dream Week games in Florida during the winter. He was also the president of Orlando’s Double-A Southern League team from 1990-1993. Williams was born in Philadelphia on May 3, 1940, and was raised in nearby Wilmington, Del., where he attended Tower Hill School. He was voted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame in 2001. Williams was diagnosed in February 2011 with multiple myeloma. He accepted positions on several boards for different cancer groups throughout the country, including an appointment on the Board of Directors for the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. Williams was the author of over 100 books. An avid runner, Williams completed 58 marathons from 1996-2011, including the Boston Marathon 13 times. Williams was honored with the John W. Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012 by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and was named to the Magic's Hall of Fame as a member of its inaugural class in 2014. Williams is survived by his wife Ruth and their 19 children, 14 of whom are adopted from four foreign countries.  Celebration of Life service for Pat Williams will be held at First Baptist Orlando, 3000 S John Young Pkwy, Orlando, FL 32805 on Friday, July 26th at 3:00 pm. A live stream is available here. In recognition of Pat’s love for sports and his passion for the work of The First Academy, the Williams family wishes to designate gifts, in lieu of flowers, to the athletics program at The First Academy. Gifts may be mailed to The First Academy, 2667 Bruton Blvd, Orlando, Fl, 32805.

Taiwan-China's uneasy rivalry spills to badminton court,"‘Chinese Civil War’ in the Olympics Men’s Badminton Doubles: The Implication of Beijing’s Insecurity on Taiwan-related Issues  Taiwan has competed in the Olympic Games and other international sporting events under ‘Chinese Taipei’ since 1981. In the past few years, controversy over the nomenclature has been reported on by several international media. Awareness of the dispute between Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) and the People’s Republic of China (China) has been, again, raised due to the badminton match in the recently concluded Paris 2024 Olympics. On August 4, Chinese Taipei and China faced off in the men’s badminton doubles gold medal match at the Paris 2024 Olympics. It was noted that some Chinese Taipei (Taiwanese) supporters were asked to remove their signs and face paintings containing Taiwan-related elements, in line with the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) regulations prohibiting flags or signs that include political messages or support countries not participating in the Olympics. Additionally, it was reported that China typically stations individuals to monitor the audience and reports any signs that may violate the IOC’s rules when Chinese Taipei is competing. This practice of confiscating Taiwan-related signs is not surprising as it adheres to the agreement made in 1981. Yet, compared to the COVID-impacted Tokyo Olympics, during which no spectator was allowed to watch matches in any venue, the Paris 2024 Olympics with thousands of spectators in every arena offered Taiwan a better platform to physically engage with people from different countries. But this direct interaction also made confiscating practice obvious to spectators, granting observers a deeper insight into the delicate disputes and frictions that have characterized cross-strait relations. Through such occurrences, more people might be able to relate to Taiwan’s struggle while also increasing their scrutiny of China’s effort to control the narrative regarding Taiwan-related issues. Such situations may have a negative impact on China’s international reputation due to its harsh suppression of Taiwan in the sports world. The manner in which China broadcast the match demonstrates the high level of sensitivity regarding cross-strait relations. China Central Television (CCTV) only aired 40 out of 76 minutes of the game and did not broadcast the subsequent awards ceremony following the loss to the Chinese Taipei team. Three years ago, when Chinese Taipei played against China in the gold medal match in Tokyo, CCTV broadcast the whole game. This reflects Beijing’s attempts to control the domestic narrative regarding Taiwan-related issues by restricting information or footage deemed detrimental to the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) rule and social stability. The potential for political upheaval is seen as a core threat to the party’s legitimacy to rule and ability to maintain popular support. With mounting domestic grievances including social stress caused by unemployment, housing foreclosures, weak domestic demand, increasing crime and suicide rates, there is more urgency for the leadership in Beijing to shape narratives that positively supports its rule. Thus, China has been outspokenly supporting and applauding IOC’s practice of confiscating Taiwan-related items in stadiums. In addition, CCTV themselves play a crucial role in shaping the narrative so that Chinese audiences see Taiwan as an integral part of China. In the news, CCTV stated that “the Chinese combination Liang Wei Keng/Wang Chang was narrowly defeated by the Chinese Taipei combination by 1-2 and won second place” (中国组合梁伟铿/王昶1-2惜败中国台北组合获得亚军). The simplified Mandarin translation of Chinese Taipei, in this case, is different from how the Taiwanese translate it. ‘中国台北 (zhōng guó tái běi),’ as applied by CCTV, refers to Taipei as part of mainland China. Meanwhile, the term ‘中華台北 (zhōng huá tái běi),’ translated by Taiwan, refers to Taipei as part of the greater Chinese culture spectrum. The implication of the different translations reflects Beijing’s belief that Taiwan is a province of China. At the same time, Taiwan considers itself as a separate entity from China that shares a broad sense of Chinese culture. The television coverage of the badminton match served as another attempt to blur the line between Taiwan and China. But it also depicts Beijing’s insecurity about how its citizens and internal support might be affected by Chinese Taipei’s positive image in the international stage.  While the narrative presented by CCTV makes Taiwan look like a province under China, the suspension of broadcasting shows that Beijing is unwilling to publicize an instance where a ‘provincial team’ can defeat the mainland China team. Ironically, this approach might be a misplay as it could give space for Chinese citizens to doubt Beijing’s capacity to control Taiwan. Despite claiming that Taiwan is an inalienable part of its territory, the Olympic incident shows China’s lack of confidence in terms of this sensitive issue.

Proud host of Wikipedia and its sister sites  Ninety-three Major League Baseball All-Star Games have been played since the inaugural one in 1933. The American League (AL) leads the series with a 48–44–2 (.521) record, and a 388–380 run advantage.[1] The NL has the longest winning streak of 11 games from 1972 to 1982; the AL held a 13-game unbeaten streak from 1997 to 2009 (including a tie in 2002). The AL previously dominated from 1933 to 1949, winning 12 of the first 16. The NL dominated from 1950 to 1987, going 33–8–1, including a stretch from 1963 to 1982 when they won 19 of 20. Since 1988, the AL has dominated, going 28–7–1. In 2018, the AL took their first lead in the series since 1963. The ""home team"" has traditionally been the league in which the host franchise plays its games; however, the AL was designated the home team for the 2016 All-Star Game, despite it being played in Petco Park, home of the National League's San Diego Padres. This decision was made following the announcement of Miami as host for the 2017 All-Star Game, which was the third consecutive year in which the game is hosted in an NL ballpark. The criteria for choosing the venue are subjective; for the most part, cities with new parks and cities who have not hosted the game in a long time—or ever—tend to get the nod. In the first two decades of the game there were two pairs of teams that shared ballparks, located in Philadelphia and St. Louis. This led to some shorter-than-usual gaps between the use of those venues: The Cardinals hosted the game in 1940, and the Browns in 1948. The Athletics hosted the game in 1943, and the Phillies in 1952. A second game was played for four seasons, from 1959 through 1962. The All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award was introduced in 1962 and the first recipient was Maury Wills of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The 2008 game featured the longest All-Star Game by time: 4 hours 50 minutes, and tied for innings at 15 with the 1967 game.

Frédéric Vasseur’s Plan for Ferrari Begins to Pay Off,"Frédéric Vasseur’s Plan for Ferrari Begins to Pay Off                                                    As a Frenchman running a beloved Italian team, fans weren’t happy at first, but the team is now second for the constructors’ title. By Ian Parkes In January last year, Frédéric Vasseur started one of the toughest jobs in motorsports, team principal of the Ferrari Formula 1 team. It did not help that as a Frenchman, Vasseur was the first non-Italian to be appointed to the position since Jean Todt left in 2007. The Ferrari fans, known as Tifosi, were unhappy with the decision. In an episode of the Netflix documentary “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” they made their feelings known. “He’s never done this job,” one person said. “What the heck has he come here to do?” On Vasseur’s not speaking Italian, another said, “A team like Ferrari is a family. It’s important.” Vasseur said the fan reaction didn’t surprise him. “They have always been very positive, not necessarily with me, but with the team,” he said in an interview. ADVERTISEMENT “There are always people at the entrance of the factory in the morning, or the evening when I’m leaving, and they are all positive,” he added. “I have never had someone shout, ‘Ah, you are doing rubbish.’ The guys who are there are shouting, ‘Allez, allez, allez.’” Under Mattia Binotto, the previous team principal, Ferrari finished second in the constructors’ championship in 2022. Charles Leclerc was runner-up in the drivers’ standings. Last year, under Vasseur, Ferrari was third, Leclerc fifth and Carlos Sainz, his teammate, seventh. This season the results have improved as Vasseur pieces together a plan to help the team win its first championship since 2008. Leclerc and Sainz are now third and fifth in the drivers’ championship and have finished on the podium six times, including Sainz winning the Australian Grand Prix in March with Leclerc finishing second. The team is also second in the constructors’ championship behind Red Bull. “Short term, it’s more about putting everything together, to have a good team spirit,” Vasseur said. “You can reorganize some departments, to change people, but it is more a matter of mind-set at the end. We did it quite quickly last year, and it’s paying off. ADVERTISEMENT “As a team principal, you can quickly change the mentality, the ability to take risks, instill self-confidence. With this kind of team spirit, let’s call it, we made a decent step forward.” A Close Race: Max Verstappen is still firmly on top of the drivers’ championship, but McLaren is mounting a challenge for the team title. Keeping Drivers and Fans Safe: Silverstone’s medical team is “probably the best in the world for motor racing.” From Bombers to Racecars: The home of the British Grand Prix, a R.A.F. base during World War II, had its first race in 1948. An Attraction Beyond Racing: The historic track at Silverstone is no longer “just a motorsport circuit.” More on Formula 1: Stories about drivers, teams and issues. In Binotto’s final season of his four in charge, Ferrari made errors during Grands Prix, on strategy, in pit stops and from Leclerc that allowed Red Bull and Max Verstappen to comfortably win the titles. Vasseur joined Ferrari weeks before the start of the new season. He said that he never felt resistance to his appointment, but that with little time to integrate himself into the team, it was “quite brutal.” “I needed time to understand,” he said. “It’s very difficult to arrive at a team and say we are weak on this, this and this because it’s not just a matter of results. You need to understand the reasons. ADVERTISEMENT “If we are not doing good pit stops, or the strategy is not good, why? Is it a matter of people, tools, organization of the pit wall? You need to understand, to see them working together, and that takes a little bit of time.” After improving the team spirit in the short term, the mid- and long-term projects have involved strengthening the team. On the drivers’ side, Lewis Hamilton, a seven-time champion, will join Ferrari next year after 12 seasons with Mercedes. In the junior categories, en route to Formula 1, Hamilton won the Formula 3 Euro Series title in 2005 with ASM, led by Vasseur. The next year he was GP2 champion with ART GP, also under Vasseur. Hamilton said it was his “great relationship” with Vasseur that persuaded him to activate a release clause in his Mercedes contract that was to run until the end of 2025. “We had amazing success in F3 and GP2, and that’s really where the foundation of our relationship started,” Hamilton said. “We always remained in touch. I thought he was going to be an amazing team manager at some stage and progress to F1, but at the time, he wasn’t interested in that.” ADVERTISEMENT It was not until 2016 that Vasseur moved into Formula 1 as team principal, of Renault. He resigned after six months. Six months later he joined Sauber Motorsport as managing director and chief executive, and became team principal of the Sauber team. “It was really cool to see him step into that team,” Hamilton said. “Then when he got the job at Ferrari, I was just so happy for him.” The friendship between Hamilton and Vasseur was pivotal to his joining Ferrari. “The stars aligned, and I think it really wouldn’t have happened without him,” Hamilton said. “I’m really excited about the work he’s doing there.” To make way for Hamilton, Vasseur informed that Sainz he would be leaving at the end of this year. Sainz was the only driver to win a Grand Prix last season other than drivers from Red Bull. “I have huge respect for Carlos,” Vasseur said. “I’m perfectly aware of the job he did last year. He was the architect of our recovery after the summer break. He brought us the win in Singapore and the podium in Monza. ADVERTISEMENT “But for the team, being able to bring Lewis on board was a no-brainer for tons of reasons. I had to take a decision, and the decision was harsh. We closed the discussion by saying, ‘It is like it is. Let’s push until the last corner of the last lap and do a mega-good season.’” On the technical side, Loïc Serra, performance engineer at Mercedes, will join Ferrari next season. Adrian Newey, who has helped Red Bull win seven drivers’ and six constructors’ titles during his 19 seasons with the team, is leaving the team early next year. Hamilton said it would be a privilege to work with Newey. “If I was to make a list of people I would love to work with, he would absolutely be at the top of it,” he said. Leclerc said Newey was someone “who can make a difference.” Newey said he was “going to take a little bit of a break and see what happens next.” Vasseur would not comment on whether he would sign Newey, but was aware that important hires take time. “The recruitment of people is very long,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Leclerc, who signed a new contract with Ferrari in January, said the team was “in a very good moment” with Vasseur in charge. “Fred has always shared with me his medium- to long-term vision of the team, and it’s going really well,” Leclerc said. “I’m really happy with how it is going. We are in a good place to attract the best people in the world. “I have said it before, but we are a really good team already, and in the last seven, eight months, we’ve made incredible progress. Whoever now comes in to make us even stronger is super important.” Vasseur said his time in charge had been “very demanding,” not just for him but also “for every single team member.” ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t want to say that I won’t take harsh decisions, but at least on the difficult days, it’s much easier to smile than to not smile,” he said. When the “Drive to Survive” episode on Ferrari ran in February, the fans’ perception of Vasseur had changed. “I have a lot of faith in Vasseur,” one fan said in the episode. Another added, “He can bring Ferrari back to where it deserves to be.” ADVERTISEMENT","""What recent achievements or improvements in Ferrari's performance or business can be attributed to Frédéric Vasseur's plan?""",True,True,True

Proud host of Wikipedia and its sister sites   Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa (/məˈmoʊə/; born August 1, 1979[1]) is an American actor. He made his acting debut as Jason Ioane on the syndicated action drama series Baywatch: Hawaii (1999–2001), which was followed by portrayals of Ronon Dex on the Syfy science fiction series Stargate Atlantis (2005–2009), and Khal Drogo in the first two seasons of the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones (2011–2012). He went on to play the lead roles in the Discovery Channel historical drama series Frontier (2016–2018) and the Apple TV+ science fiction series See (2019–2022). From 2016 to 2023, Momoa portrayed Aquaman in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), primarily in the films Justice League (2017), Aquaman (2018), and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023), with cameo appearances in other media. Momoa has also played Duncan Idaho in the science fiction film Dune (2021), and has starred in the action film Fast X (2023). An only child, Momoa was born on August 1, 1979, in Honolulu, Hawaii,[2] to Coni (Lemke), a photographer, and Joseph Momoa, a painter. His father is Native Hawaiian,[3][4] while his mother is of German, Irish, and Pawnee[2] ancestry.[5] Shortly after his birth, his parents divorced and he and his mother moved to Norwalk, Iowa, where he was raised. He graduated from Norwalk High School and was a member of the school's soccer team alongside Brandon Routh.[6] Momoa attended Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC) and later attended the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.[7][1] While in his teens, Momoa became a rock climber and boulderer when his mother took him to Custer State Park where lies Sylvan Lake and the Needles of South Dakota.[8][9] At 19 years old, while living and working in Honolulu, Momoa decided to audition for the television series Baywatch Hawaii,[1][10] in which he was cast as Jason Ioane (1999–2001).[11] He was in the main cast on the 2004–2005 Fox drama North Shore as Frankie. In 2004 Momoa appeared in the film Johnson Family Vacation.

He portrayed the title protagonist in Conan the Barbarian (2011), a reimagining of the 1982 film of the same name and a role made famous by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Momoa gained notoriety for his role of Khal Drogo on HBO's Game of Thrones. In his audition for the role, he performed a Haka,[13] one of many intimidating Māori dances traditionally used to convey a challenge to an opponent, or a welcome to a visitor.[14] Momoa directed and co-wrote Road to Paloma (2014), an American drama thriller film, together with writers Jonathan Hirschbein and Robert Homer Mollohan. The film stars Momoa, Sarah Shahi, Lisa Bonet, Michael Raymond-James and Wes Studi.[15] It premiered at the 2014 Sarasota Film Festival in April 2014.[16] The film had a limited theatrical release on July 15, 2014, in New York City and Los Angeles and a VOD release.[17] In March 2014, Momoa joined the dark comedy/thriller indie Sugar Mountain alongside Cary Elwes and Haley Webb; its principal photography was done in Alaska.[18][19] He also starred as Phillip Kopus, a Ramapough Mountain Indian, on the SundanceTV drama series The Red Road (2014–2015).[20] In June 2014, Momoa was reported to have been cast in the role of Arthur Curry / Aquaman, after he auditioned for Bruce Wayne / Batman.[21] He first played the role in a cameo in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,[22][23][24] marking Aquaman's live action film debut. Momoa played the character in a leading role in the 2017 ensemble film Justice League and its director's cut, Zack Snyder's Justice League. He then starred in the Aquaman solo film, which was released in late 2018.[25][26][27] He also reprised this role in The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part.[28] In August 2014, Momoa portrayed Connor in the Canadian horror action film Wolves,[29] and starred in the Sci-fi horror movie Debug; it was written and directed by Momoa's former Stargate Atlantis co-star, British-born Canadian actor David Hewlett. In February 2015, it was announced that he would portray a cannibal[30] in the drama thriller film The Bad Batch.[31] In 2015, Momoa was cast in the Canadian action film Braven, which was released on February 2, 2018. In March 2017, it was announced that Momoa would play Rico Rodriguez in the official Just Cause film series.[32][33] Between 2016 and 2018, Momoa portrayed Declan Harp in all three seasons of the Canadian historical drama television series Frontier and was an executive producer on the show. The series chronicles the North American fur trade in late 1700s Canada, and follows Declan Harp, a part-Irish, part-Cree outlaw who is campaigning to breach the Hudson's Bay Company's monopoly on the fur trade in Canada, which has become corrupt and engages in illegal activities to enrich itself.[34][35] In July 2018, Momoa was cast for Apple's post-apocalyptic drama series See.[36][37] In February 2019, Momoa was cast as Duncan Idaho in the Denis Villeneuve film Dune.[38][39] In February 2020, Momoa appeared in a halftime commercial for Rocket Mortgage for Super Bowl LIV.

They were together for six years and became engaged in 2004. Mackinnon and Momoa called off their engagement after Momoa began a relationship with actress Lisa Bonet in 2005.[41][42] Although it was previously believed that Momoa and Bonet had married on November 15, 2007, the couple did not marry until October 2017.[43] Daughter Lola Iolani was born in July 2007,[44][42] and son Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha[44] was born in December 2008.[45] In January 2022, Momoa and Bonet announced their split.[46] In January 2024, Bonet filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences and listing their date of separation as October 7, 2020.[47][48] As of 2024, he is in a relationship with actress Adria Arjona.[49][50] He is a fan of heavy metal music[51] and has noted that he ""build[s] [his] characters off of metal songs"".[52] He invited members of Archspire for cameo appearances in the first episode of the TV series See, and he also practiced proper screaming technique with the vocalist of Archspire, Oli Peters, for a significant scene in the series.[53][54] On October 30, 2020, Momoa was featured in the song ""Doom"" by black metal band Scour.[55] Momoa is a hobby musician and plays bass guitar, mandolin, ukulele[56] and guitar[57] in his spare time, the first of which he took up after listening to Tool's song ""Sober"".[58] In 2024, Momoa formed the power trio ÖOF TATATÁ alongside longtime friends Kenny Dale Borill and Mike Hayes, performing at Music City’s Cannery Hall in May.[59] The band performed a one-off show in Auckland, New Zealand in August.[60] Momoa has numerous tattoos, including a half sleeve on his left forearm, a tribute to his family god, or aumakua.[61] He participated in protests against the building of the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea, a holy spiritual site for native Hawaiians.[62][63] In 2017, Momoa began practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu.[64][65] On November 15, 2008, Momoa was slashed across the face with a broken beer glass during an altercation at the Birds Cafe, a tavern in Los Angeles, California.[66][67] He received approximately 140 stitches during reconstructive surgery and the scar through his left eyebrow is apparent in his later work.[66] The assailant was sentenced to five years in prison for the attack.[67]","""What is the current age of actor Jason Momoa as of today?""",True,False,True

Chappell Roan's success marks the rise of the 'middle class' pop star,"Chappell Roan's success marks the rise of the 'middle class' pop star          Chappell Roan is no longer just “your favorite artist’s favorite artist.” After a string of viral festival performances — videos of which showed massive crowds growing week after week — the once-niche pop singer has ascended to mainstream success. Roan, who is known for the queer themes in her music and her drag-inspired aesthetic, is among the recent crop of artists who have hit unforeseen career highs in recent months, despite being considered part of pop music’s “middle class.” This designation has typically been associated with artists who have cultivated devout online fan bases, but who are not necessarily household names. A-list pop stardom has become increasingly difficult to achieve. But some music industry experts say the recent rise of Roan and others — including Sabrina Carpenter, Tinashe and Charli XCX — is a testament to their authenticity and ability to foster such strong fandoms. Pop stardom used to be about creating music for the widest possible audience, said Louis Mandelbaum, better known as DJ Louie XIV and the host of “Pop Pantheon,” a podcast that dissects and ranks pop stars’ legacies. “There were indie bands that could kind of build local audiences and there were other types of music where you could have more of a niche career,” said Mandelbaum. “But when it came to sort of being a pop star, there was really only this one way to operate.” As a diverse array of genres have risen in popularity, artists are able to find success — to varying degrees — with niche sounds. Taking a look at the top 10 of Billboard’s Hot 100 songs chart, the genres often span from country to rap to pop — and beyond. Mandelbaum pointed out that some of the most popular artists today, such as Billie Eilish or SZA, make music that may not be recognizable to the general public. “That was not true of, you know, ‘Teenage Dream’ [by Katy Perry] or ‘Escapade’ [by Janet Jackson] or ‘Don’t Stop ‘til You Get Enough’ [by Michael Jackson],” Mandelbaum said. Instead of being “pop” as in popular across the culture, artists like Roan, XCX, Carpenter and Tinashe treat “pop” as a genre to be built upon rather than a trending sound. Morgan Milardo, managing and artistic director of the Berklee Popular Music Institute, said live performances have also been integral in creating communities around these artists. Roan’s debut album, “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” which came out in September, did not appear on the Billboard 200 albums chart in its opening week, according to the outlet. It only entered the chart in April 2024, following Roan’s stint as an opener for Olivia Rodrigo. Her album has slowly climbed to the top 10 of the Billboard 200. She also has multiple songs on the Hot 100. Milardo pointed to the decision to move Roan to a bigger stage at the Bonnaroo music festival following the turnout for her set at the Governors Ball festival as another sign of her ascendance. “Moving an artist based on a festival that they performed the week before is pretty unheard of,” said Milardo, who has worked on the festival circuit. “And so that growth, the metrics, the streaming data, watching it skyrocket through the roof after each festival, that’s not a coincidence.” Carpenter, who snagged the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time with her hit “Please Please Please,” also rose in popularity after opening for Taylor Swift and performing midday at the same big festivals as Roan. She was recently chosen to replace Tyler, the Creator as a headliner at Outside Lands, a move Milardo said usually takes a couple years for an artist of Carpenter’s stature to achieve. “It’s like we’re seeing the direct correlation and the direct connection between what’s happening on the charts and what’s happening on streaming platforms versus what’s happening in touring, and specifically the festival circuit,” said Milardo. It is also impossible to divorce the success of these stars from the current cultural and political climate, according to Milardo. The authenticity of these artists, who are known for being brash and unapologetically themselves, is refreshing at a time when the rights of women and LGBTQ people are being threatened. “Part of why they attract such a loyal fan base is because they’re allowing their fans to be authentic too, and they’re developing community and creating camaraderie for their fans,” said Milardo. Charli XCX, the British pop star considered a cult favorite among music fans, snagged her highest-charting album to date with her club record “Brat,” which dropped on June 7. The album has inspired people to aspire to a “brat summer,” which encourages them to be messy, candid and unapologetic. Mandelbaum said pop music fans crave “idiosyncratic” musicians today. With Roan in particular, Mandelbaum said, “her identity and her music is speaking to something deep inside of youth culture right now, particularly as it pertains to the representation of queer people in mainstream pop.” This synergy has made Roan “the right person for the right time” and allowed her to break through in a way pop musicians have not done in a while, said Mandelbaum. Even with the recent wave of success these artists have achieved, the standard rules of pop stardom have not been imperative to their overall career. Hit singles are “almost incidental,” said Mandelbaum. “It’s about speaking to this cult fan base directly,” Mandelbaum said, “and making idiosyncratic music that pleases them.” Daysia Tolentino is a culture and internet reporter for NBC News. © 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL","""What evidence supports the claim that Chappell Roan's success is indicative of the rise of the 'middle class' pop star?""",True,True,True

Britney Spears biopic in the works at Universal,"Britney Spears Biopic Film Set at Universal With ‘Wicked’ Director Jon M. Chu   Universal Pictures has landed the rights to Britney Spears‘ bestselling memoir “The Woman in Me,” with “Wicked” director Jon M. Chu and producer Marc Platt attached to develop the feature. Spears shared news of the “secret project” on social media, writing that Platt has “always made my favorite movies” and telling her fans to “stay tuned” for more news. Universal won the rights to the Grammy winner’s memoir (which released last October and has sold over 2.5 million copies in the United States alone) in a highly competitive auction. In the book, Spears chronicled her journey to pop superstardom from her “Mickey Mouse Club” days through her highly publicized and scrutinized conservatorship case, with remarkable candor and humor. The book was brutally honest and went in-depth regarding her relationships with ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake and her family, chronicling the predatory nature of those around her in an attempt to control her life. The audiobook — read by Academy Award-nominated actor Michelle Williams, with an introduction by Spears — is the fastest-selling in Simon & Schuster’s history.  At the time, Spears was quoted as saying: “I poured my heart and soul into my memoir, and I am grateful to my fans and readers around the world for their unwavering support.”  Universal has a record of success with its musical biopics, including 2015’s “Straight Outta Compton,” which focused on N.W.A. and grossed more than $200 million, and 2002’s “8 Mile,” which grossed $250 million globally. The studio is currently developing the definitive biopic of Snoop Dogg, as well as a film inspired by Prince’s music, produced by Ryan Coogler’s Proximity Media. The studio also recently wrapped production on project from Pharrell Williams and Michel Gondry, inspired by the Grammy winners’ childhood neighborhood. Meanwhile, the first chapter of Chu and Pratt’s adaptation of the hit Broadway musical “Wicked,” starring Emmy, Grammy and Tony-winner Cynthia Erivo and Grammy winner Ariana Grande, will release in theaters on Nov. 22. “Wicked Part Two” is dated for Nov. 26, 2025. Spears has been relatively out of the spotlight since she was released from her conservatorship in November 2021. Aside from regularly posting videos of her dancing on Instagram, she stated earlier this year that she “never will” return to the music industry, and that she’s instead been ghostwriting songs for other artists.  She most recently made headlines after Halsey released her new single “Lucky,” which arrived hand-in-hand with a music video last week. In the lead-up to the song’s release, Halsey claimed that Spears gave her permission to interpolate her 2000 single of the same name for the song. But following the video release, Spears posted and then swiftly deleted a message on X (formerly Twitter) claiming that she felt “harassed, violated and bullied” by her portrayal as a “superficial pop star.” Shortly after, she claimed that the post was “fake news” and that she had love for Halsey, who quote-tweeted the message and shared her support for the singer. “I love Britney!!!!” wrote Halsey. “I always have and always will 💕 you were the first person who ever made me realize what it means to feel inspired. And you continue to inspire me everyday.” Spears is represented by Hudson Management and CAA. Chu is represented by Artists First, UTA, Allison Binder, Esq of GGSSC and ID.

The 1975 sued over singer Matty Healy’s same-sex kiss protesting Malaysia’s anti-LGBTQ laws,"The 1975 is sued over singer Matty Healy’s same-sex kiss in protest of Malaysia’s anti-LGBTQ laws          Organizers of the Malaysia-based Good Vibes Festival are suing the British rock band The 1975 and its members, saying the group violated prohibitions by sharing a same-sex kiss while performing in Kuala Lumpur last year. The band, whose members include Matty Healy, Adam Hann, Ross MacDonald and George Daniel, headlined on the first date of the three-day festival in July 2023. Healy and MacDonald shared a kiss onstage during their set in protest of Malaysia’s anti-LGBTQ laws. Same-sex relationships are illegal in Malaysia, according to the LGBTQ advocacy organization Outright International. The remainder of the festival was canceled after the band’s demonstration. The festival is seeking about $2.4 million, claiming that the band breached its contract resulting in financial loss for the festival’s organizer, Future Sound Asia. Representatives for Future Sound Asia and The 1975 did not respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit, filed in the U.K. High Court on July 23, alleges that the band was aware of the restrictions they needed to follow in order to perform. The organizers allege that the band planned to break the rules ahead of the festival. Restrictions included kissing, swearing, taking off clothes, drinking or smoking onstage and talking about politics or religion, according to the lawsuit.  The lawsuit also alleges that the band had been bound to the same restrictions when performing at the festival in 2016. The agreement from 2016 had stated that “flouting them will result in the event permit being revoked,” according to the lawsuit. During the band’s 2023 set, Healy said that he had made a “mistake” when booking the festival. He then slammed Malaysia’s anti-LGBTQ policies while onstage.  “I do not see the f------ point of inviting The 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with,” he said at the time.  He then kissed MacDonald. Shortly after, the band ended the set early and Healy told the crowd that the band had “just got banned from Kuala Lumpur.”  It was not the first time that Healy had protested a country’s anti-LGBTQ laws during a performance. In 2019, Healy kissed a male fan onstage in Dubai, the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates, where homosexuality is illegal. He said authorities were “going to arrest me” afterward, but the band managed to leave the country after the show, according to an interview with Healy from The Times of London. After the Good Vibes Festival incident, Malaysia’s minister of communications, Fahmi Fadzil, criticized The 1975 on X and called their actions “very rude.”  “There is no compromise against any party that challenges, disparages and violates Malaysian laws,” he posted. Fadzil subsequently announced the cancellation of the remainder of the 2023 festival after meeting with representatives of Future Sound Asia.

MrBeast collaborator Ava Kris Tyson leaves YouTube channel after accusations of grooming,"The Inside Story of the ‘Grooming’ Allegations Against Ava Kris Tyson  BY STEVEN ASARCH On Tuesday, Ava Kris Tyson announced on X that she would “permanently step away from all things MrBeast and social media.” The longtime collaborator and childhood friend of Jimmy Donaldson, the man behind the 305 million subscriber YouTube kingdom with its own line of Walmart-sold chocolate bars and videos that pull in hundreds of millions of views, apologized for any “past behavior or comments if it hurt or offended anyone.” Donaldson issued his own X statement on Wednesday night, saying he’s “aware of the serious allegations” and has “taken immediate action to remove Ava from the company, my channel, and any association with MrBeast.” He also stated he would be launching an independent investigation into Tyson’s actions. The apologies come in the wake of a flood of new and revisited allegations looking into the 28-year-old’s behavior on social media over the past decade. Tyson is a trans woman and has been the target of anti-LGBTQ+ harassment since her transition in 2023.  Recently, videos have claimed that starting in 2016, Tyson, who was 20 at the time, had been interacting online and exchanging messages that included sexual content with a user named LavaGS since they were 13 years old. Lava, who is now a 20-year-old editor, also took a job with MrBeast and visited the Beast compound. Some online have felt Lava was “groomed” because of their interactions. (Neither Donaldson nor Tyson returned a request for comment before publication.)  In a series of follow-up tweets, Tyson shared that they “never groomed anyone” and specifically mentioned Lava. “In past years, I have learned that my old humor is not acceptable,” Tyson wrote. “I cannot change who I was, but I can continue to work on myself.”  Lava backed this up by tweeting,  “I am not a victim…Nothing bad happened between me and Kris, people are creating lies around my name.”  In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lava said he believes that the two creators who originally made videos on the subject twisted his story and misrepresented him in order to push their agenda. Rolling Stone also spoke with those two creators who deny any wrongdoing, believing that Tyson’s actions needed to come to light at any cost.   LAVA HAS BEEN A FAN OF MrBeast since the early days of the channel, posting a screenshot of the channel’s 50,000 subscriber count on Twitter in 2016 and earning a MrBeast-signed butterfly knife for being a top donor with just $20. That contest earned him a Twitter follow from both Donaldson and Tyson. Around that time, Tyson’s social media persona was “edgy.” In 2017, she posted images online and on her wall (appearing in a MrBeast video) of “lolli,” or drawn child porn, from controversial internet artist Shadman. Tyson has never directly responded to these allegations.  As a 13-year-old, Lava had been tinkering with the newly released messaging app Discord, learning how to make servers and bots. “Kris reached out to me and saw I was making Discord for people,” Lava says. “He was new to it and wanted a bot that could play Lo-Fi study music which isn’t hard to do.”   Using what he knew, Lava built Tyson a Discord server for “close friends” and he “just ended up staying in” and “running” it, Lava says. According to Lava, Tyson did not pay for the creation or maintenance of the server, and he did it “solely for the fun of it and helping [build] a community for fans of MrBeast and Kris.”  Lava claims that Tyson was unaware of his age until 2018, though couldn’t remember the specific details on how it came up.  In 2018 and 2019, the pair would play games and communicate in private on Discord. They would also talk publicly on X (formerly Twitter). Lava would call Tyson “big boy,” “dad,” “sexy” and at one point asked her to be his  “valentine.” In one reply, Lava asked Tyson about her “hentai addiction,” referring to drawn animé pornography, and in another shared an image of Tyson’s computer from her social media with the caption, “This is a bad way to hide your hentai.” Though Tyson’s side of these conversations has been completely deleted, about two dozen of Lava’s messages remain up on X.   In one interaction, Tyson tweeted an image of her Patreon and said that if she could get one more sign-up she would be “releasing my noods.” Lava replied with “I’m your first Patreon big boy” and Tyson responded with  “I posted some fire noods for you. Pls no share.” (No nudes were shared.)  In a Discord server for gaming YouTuber TheDooo, Lava posted an image from Tyson’s group chat of her in front of an American flag with the caption “Cumming for America.”  To others, these conversations look inappropriate, but it was nothing out of the ordinary to Lava. “I was at the age where I spoke to all my friends like that,” Lava says. “There was nothing more than that. It’s how bros talk…I saw Kris as an older brother because he reminded me a lot of my older brother.”  In May 2020, Lava says Tyson helped him land a job as a production assistant on Beast Gaming. Lava was a moderator on the channel’s Discord and Reddit, sometimes appearing in videos or helping out behind the scenes. That July, Lava visited MrBeast’s compound in North Carolina, posting a picture on X with Tyson, Donaldson, as well as Trey Yates, who edited for MrBeast from 2018 to 2021 and was the one who hired Lava.   Lava tells Rolling Stone that he and his parents would “stay at a campground every year” which wasn’t far from the compound, and that his parents joined him on the visit.   Yates, who was also the one who hired Lava at Beast Gaming, shared his side of the story with Rolling Stone. “He came to visit because he knew Ava from playing games online,” Yates says. “Ava wanted Lava to work for the MrBeast Gaming channel and we were happy to bring him on and pay him.”  On the grooming allegations, Yates saw the way Lava and Tyson interacted and didn’t think it was strange or out of the ordinary. “There was never any hint or indication that something like that was happening or even, albeit, blatant proof that something like that was occurring,” he says. LAVA STOPPED WORKING FOR BeastGaming in May 2021, though he and Tyson remained in contact. In July 2023, Tyson came out as trans, which caused a flurry of conversation on the right. One right-leaning creator who had thoughts about Tyson happened to be Prism42, a YouTuber with 800 subscribers who had found the messages between Lava and Tyson on 4chan (though it’s unclear how they ended up there). Prism felt he needed to get this information out so, he claimed, he contacted 50 creators including Turning Point USA CEO Charlie Kirk, former To Catch a Predator host Chris Hansen, and YouTube documentarian Mike Clum. There was also EDP445, a creator who in 2021 was caught in a YouTube vigilante’s sting operation messaging a fake 13-year-old. (Clum is currently making a documentary about him.) “[Prism] began to message me directly with vague details about an unnamed creator who will be exposed and he wanted to see if I could help him,” Clum tells Rolling Stone. “Given the nature of the accusations, I said I would take a look if he sent them to me. He began to send more information about [Ava] Tyson and what seemed to be generally available screenshots or details that weren’t actionable given the work I do.” When none of those reach-outs gained traction, Prism took another approach. In an interview on the Chud Logic podcast, he said he wanted to emulate the undercover work of disgraced journalist James O’Keefe of Project Veritas who in February settled a suit over false claims of 2020 voter fraud. In June 2023, Prism reached out to Lava in a message seen by Rolling Stone, pretending to want to “interview an anime fan” and that “it would be interesting because you worked on the MrBeast server.” Lava did not answer that message.   For his next attempt, Prism contacted YouTuber Verdius, an 18-year-old with 600 subscribers, and had him reach out to Lava looking to interview him for an editor position. Verdius tells Rolling Stone that he had “no idea” that he was being set up or that Lava had anything to do with Tyson or MrBeast — he was just looking for an editor. During the “interview,” Lava says, the conversation started with editing questions but quickly devolved into a conversation about internet predators. Prism asked Lava to comment on a video from EDP445 talking about Tyson.  On June 13, Verdius and Prism each released their own video about the Tyson messages, though neither included information from Lava’s interview with them. Prism repeatedly misgendered Tyson and included multiple factual inaccuracies, including claiming that “the moment he was able to drive,” Lava drove himself to the Beast compound, and that the “cumming” photo was sent personally to Lava on Snapchat, when Lava claims it was a group message. (When reached out for comment, Prism called Rolling Stone “fake news” and hung up.) Both videos went relatively unnoticed until July 18, when YouTube commentator Adrox released a video aggregating the claims that became algorithmic catnip, currently sitting at over one million views. From there, dozens of creators picked up the story, with the largest being from penguinz0 which is sitting at over seven million views.  “Prism purposely left out context and did not ask me about specific situations,” Lava said. “There was nothing bad that happened at all, if I would have told him that I would have basically invalidated his whole argument which is why he never asked me these questions.”  ON SOCIAL MEDIA, PRISM’S CLAIMS that Tyson talked “inappropriately” to a 13-year-old gained viral traction. Anti-LGBTQ+ activists like Tristan Tate, his brother Andrew, and LibsofTikTok have used this story as an excuse to push anti-trans rhetoric. The comment section under Lava’s original tweet denouncing the claims is full of comments saying he was “groomed” and is a “gay victim.”  In the podcast with Chud Logic, Prism says “I don’t believe men can become women with modern technology but that’s not a point I’m going to make because it is separate from the allegations.” In an interview with Rolling Stone, Verdius said he tried to keep his coverage “unbiased” but posts on Tyson’s private Twitter of her son in heels, and that fact that she “followed the Church of Satan” may have made him “a little bit biased.”   For those with experience with Tyson, these serious claims seem to be getting co-opted. “All of this is just your typical alt-right influencers trying to push something against trans people because they think they have something,” Yates says.   Lava “no longer wishes” to be involved with Tyson though they haven’t worked together in years, but still believes, “I’m not a victim.” “I do not appreciate [the transphobic comments] being attached to my name, I have my own personal beliefs about the situation as everyone should,” Lava says. “I believe attacking someone while using my name is completely uncalled for.”  We want to hear it.

Justin Simien mourns Lando spinoff series shelving: 'I am in grief',"Star Wars Project ‘Lando’ Not Moving Forward, Says Director Justin Simien  By Bruce Haring  Justin Simien says the Donald Glover-starring Solo: A Star Wars Story spinoff series Lando will not be happening. Collider published remarks Friday from Simien indicating that Lando is dead. Simien is out promoting Hollywood Black, an MGM+ docuseries based on the book by scholar Donald Bogle examining race and representation in Hollywood. That’s when the Lando project came up. “It was pretty developed,” he said. “There was a Bible. There was concept art. There were scripts. But it just wasn’t meant to be.”  He added that he grieved for the project.  “For me, it has to be done pretty straight on. Like, ‘I am in grief. I do not feel good.’ I have to let myself feel those feelings,” he said. “There’s so much that I experience that I get to keep forever and take into the next project. I can’t obviously take the storyline or the IP or the characters, but there’s so much more that I got, as a maker, and that’s mine. Sorry, it’s too late, you can’t take that part back.”  Lando was first announced in 2020. Glover’s Lando was the breakout star of Solo, and Simien had three seasons of Dear White People, the series he created, directed, and wrote for Netflix. It all seemed ready to pop. Why Lando fell through the cracks at Disney+ is still unclear. But Simien has plenty on his plate. Simien has a live-action Star Trek comedy series starring Tawny Newsome on the way, announced at San Diego Comic-Con. The logline: “Federation outsiders serving a gleaming resort planet find out their day-to-day exploits are being broadcast to the entire quadrant.” “I literally grew up watching that show and wishing I could go to space,” Simien told Collider about the Star Trek project. I’m living that childhood dream right now.” Hollywood Black will premiere on August 11 on MGM+. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Correction: his VERSION of the project will not be moving forward. We’ll still be getting a Lando project with Donald Glover. Too bad. I would have liked a Lando series, especially if they’d have had Billy Dee Williams involved as a narrator. However, I’m not surprised by the decision. Donald Glover’s plate seems really full right now. Has it been confirmed that Newsome will be “starring” in the Star Trek sitcom? I’ve only read references to her being a writer and executive producer. Let’s be clear, Glover was not the breakout star of “Solo”. Shutting this project down is the best thing that can happen after the disaster of “The Acolyte”. Someone will come along to revive the show. By hook or by crook, it’ll get done. It may take a while, but it’ll happen. Signup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Rob Lowe thinks 9-1-1: Lone Star will conclude with season 5:,"As 9-1-1: Lone Star Enters Possible Final Season, Rob Lowe Admits That ‘It Feels Like the End of an Era’   Though Fox has yet to make a final decision about 9-1-1: Lone Star‘s future beyond its upcoming fifth season, star and executive producer Rob Lowe doesn’t sound too confident about its renewal odds. He is, however, incredibly proud of what the 9-1-1 spinoff has managed to accomplish. “We all went into it pretty much knowing that it was going to be the last season, so that affected everything we did,” Lowe tells our sister publication Variety. “We wanted to really show everybody what is still possible in network television if people have the appetite to do it. It feels like it’s probably the end of an era of a certain type — well, it doesn’t feel like it. It is the end of an era of a certain type of show we once had an opportunity to make, and I think they’re great.”  Lowe’s biggest source of pride is in the “scope and scale” of the stories that Lone Star was able to tell on a weekly basis. “We wanted to go out making our case for the value of shows like that,” he says, “and I think we did a really good job.” When it comes to a potential final season for Lone Star, the rumor mill has been working overtime since June, with several cast and crew members posting cryptic messages to social media, heavily implying that they don’t expect to reconvene for Season 6. Our sister site Deadline reports that the cast was under options until production on Season 5 wrapped in July, adding that Fox was unlikely to extend those options before a decision was finalized. TVLine recently caught up with Brian Michael Smith (aka firefighter Paul Strickland), who had this to say about Season 5 possibly serving as the show’s swan song: “I can’t say much to the rumors. I feel like the network said, ‘Let’s wait and see what the numbers have to say,’ so we’re going to wait and see what the numbers have to say. I hope that means everybody will tune in and show the same amount of love and support they’ve been showing us for the first four seasons.” 9-1-1: Lone Star returns for Season 5 on Monday, Sept. 23 (Fox, 8/7c).

Website    Yes, maybe because Rob Lowe and I are about the same age, regardless of whom would ever be accused of guessing wrong?  Yes I will be very disappointed. I know everything comes to the end. It’s been has good like ER. Please don’t go!  NO PLEASE DO NOT CANCEL THIS SHOW!!! GREAT SHOW & GREAT CAST!!!!!!!  I’ll be disappointed I love this show. Why do producers make seasons start so late it’s very frustrating for fans!  I love 911 Lonestar. The characters are great. I prefer Lonestar over original 911. Rob Lowe, Jim Parrack, Sierra McClain are favorites. I’ll miss her as Grace…she has good chemistry with Judd and Tommy. Gina Torres is a favorite. Please keep 911 Lonestar on !!  My family loves 911 lonestar Would hate to see it end!  I loved the show, but this past seasonwasa disappointing one . I’ll try to watch two or three episodes. If it is like last , I’m though. I love Rob Lowe .  You must have been watching a different version from me !  I love 911 Lone Star!! I’ve been waiting for it to come back on since the strike and it’s been driving me crazy! Not sure what I’ll do if they cancel it. It’s just like Hollywood or whoever decides the fate of these shows. They rip the great shows off and leave the stupid ones on!  It’s not Hollywoods fault, it’s the fault of the audiences. Contrary to what you might believe, networks don’t cancel highly rated shows. They ONLY cancel low rated shows. If people aren’t watching, it’s cancelled. If people are watching, it’s not cancelled. It’s that simple. Don’t blame anyone except the audiences. Maybe the audience doesn’t like it as much as you — and that is fine. But putting the blame on Hollywood is stupid. They don’t cancel things that make them money. lol  Sometimes they do. CBS certainly has.  Fox cancelled it’s top rated scripted show 911. Now 911 LS is likely fox’s top rated scripted drama. So there is a bit more to it… such as cost and ownership.  That’s why I also put at the end “They don’t cancel things that make them money.” Obviously if they cancel something that is top rated, there is an issue somewhere. They aren’t making enough money off it to warrant it being on their schedule. These networks don’t just go “Hey, that’s our most watched show. Let’s cancel it and make everyone mad.” They have their reasons and it’s typically money related.  Yeah it’s cost thinhmg top rayed show in today’s mkt is 6 million or so people how does that translate into revenue fox can cover it up if high rated show is loss leader and makes 9p lower priced show into a hit. The writers strike and other strikes made older shows cost more than projected originally plus audience size has shrunk yr to yr. So yeah it could be better.  Very Disappointed. I enjoyed lone star somewhat more than the original 911! this was a great cast, and they always had great stories.  Yes I will be extremely upset by this show ending!!This show is like a breath of fresh air.We all missed it when the strike was on,kept watching reruns.  With the mother show going to ABC, I sadly don’t see a future with this show at FOX. Great show though! Will miss!  WE WANT MORE, WE NEED MORE…PLEASE AT LEAST A FEW MORE SEASONS OF 9-1-1 IN LONE STAR!  I hope it continues after season 5. 9-1-1 is still going strong so why not  Fox should have ordered episodes after the writers strike and just had them… Perhaps we wouldn’t have lost Grace.  Yes I will be disappointed  I will be disappointed. I enjoy the program very much and it has increased my knowledge of what firefighters and paramedics and volunteers must work through each day. I knew they put their lives on the line for us but I never knew what kind of things they worked through. For this knowledge I will be grateful and I can now pray for our real life workers. They deserve so much more thanks and recognition they they’ll ever receive.  I love this show, truly don’t want it to end!!!  I love this show! I look forward two every episode every week. You must keep it going. 🤗  Love this show. Please renew.  I’ve enjoyed LS up until this past season, so I’m not too surprised at this upcoming season potentially being the last.  I love this show so much that I just binged watched all seasons. Please do not let this be the final season. I feel there is potential for this to go on for years.  Could 9-1-1: Lone Star be the one to give way for the midseason return of Family Guy (and, by extension, that second animated-show night)? I’m also worried about the future of 9-1-1: Lone Star (just like I have been with Family Guy) and whether it’ll end on a cliffhanger after this season. Curse the FOX network’s tight primetime schedule space and Fridays going to sports (which makes the problem worse). Perhaps Lone Star should have gone with 9-1-1 to ABC or be a Hulu exclusive?  As much as I Still Truely LOVE Rob Lowe, I think the showed turned into a show just about him and am a little disappointed in it. I Truely Loved the show in the beginning but now it is a little hard to watch.OG 911 makes it work still today for all cast members why can’t Lone Star? Much LOVE to ALL the CAST  I disagree. Season 4 had lots of plots about lots of the characters. Tommy, Marjan, Judd and his family. Mateo story line. Just off the top of my head. Rob Lowe is the star, always was. The biggest name and probably the biggest draw.  Please don’t cancel. Love this one and 911. Need shows like this to stay on.  I will be extremely disappointed and hurt for 911 lone star if the show does not return! FOX has a history of starting shows but later cancel them! Give the fans what they want and continue the show!

"J.K. Rowling, Elon Musk Criticize Olympics After Algeria’s Imane Khelif Wins Women’s Boxing Match Amid Gender Controversy: ‘A Misogynist Sporting Establishment’","Imane Khelif’s gold medal run shows how sex testing in women’s sports puts regulators in an impossible bind  Professor of Kinesiology, Penn State Jaime Schultz does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.  Penn State provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US. View all partners With the judges unanimously declaring her the victor over China’s Yang Liu, Algeria’s Imane Khelif secured the gold medal in the women’s boxing 66-kilogram (146-pound) weight class, capping an Olympic run beset with controversy and misinformation. The saga began during Khelif’s preliminary match, when she delivered a painful blow to the face of Italy’s Angela Carini, who abandoned the fight after 46 seconds. “I’ve never been hit with such a powerful punch,” Carini told reporters after the match.  The incident might have been relatively uncontroversial were it not for what had happened during the 2023 International Boxing Association (IBA) Women’s World Championships. During that tournament – two days before its conclusion – officials had disqualified Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, who fights at 57 kilograms (126 pounds). The IBA issued an official statement asserting that the women “did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors.” So how, some might wonder, were Khelif and Lin allowed to fight in the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris? What “necessary eligibility criteria” did the IBA use to make the judgment? And do those criteria give Khelif and Lin competitive advantages? In my book “Regulating Bodies,” I explore what I call “protective policies” in elite sports. These are regulations designed to protect the spirit of fair play, safeguard athletes’ health and well-being, and protect the image and interests of sports. They include policies that regulate doping and genetic enhancement, set age limits and weight classes and, in the case of Parasports, establish classes for competition. Protective policies can also regulate whether athletes compete in men’s or women’s events. But history shows that there are no conclusive ways to determine sex – and no consensus over the extent to which the distinction matters. In the 1940s, sports’ governing bodies began requiring women to submit letters from physicians confirming they were, in fact, women. In the 1960s, some athletic organizations briefly required gynecological exams and visual inspections of unclothed women before turning, in 1967, to sex chromatin tests that looked specifically for female-typical XX sex chromosomes. When, in the 1980s, it finally became clear that women could have the male-typical XY sex chromosome pair and receive no athletic benefit, there was a brief dalliance with genetic analysis before the turn toward “suspicion-based testing.” Under this system, if someone challenged an athlete’s sex, the suspected athlete could be asked to submit to a multifaceted gender verification process. Beginning around 2010, the conversation in international sports turned to natural testosterone levels, the ways that women’s bodies responded to that testosterone and specific diagnoses of intersex variations. Yet every version of sex testing collapses under scrutiny. That’s because most sports are organized according to a strict male-female binary. Nature isn’t. Each Olympic sport is governed by its own international federation, and the International Olympic Committee permits each federation to establish its own eligibility criteria when it comes to issues such as age, citizenship and sex. The 2021 “IOC Framework on Fairness, Inclusion and Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity and Sex Variations” offers a series of recommendations for federations to consider, but also recognizes that “it must be within the remit of each sport and its governing body to determine how” to determine eligibility to compete in women’s events. In other words, the IBA can decide how, for the purposes of boxing, it defines “woman.” But there were two big problems with the IBA’s decision to disqualify Khelif and Lin – both of whom have been competing in the sport for years and whose passports confirm that they are women. First, the boxing association was not acting in accordance with its official regulations. The IOC has since stated that the IBA “suddenly” disqualified the women from the 2023 World Championships “without any due process” and that the decision was “contrary to good governance.” Second, the IOC no longer regards the IBA as boxing’s international federation. After a series of concerns about the IBA’s finances, governance and ethics, the IOC stripped the IBA of its official recognition in 2023 and instead appointed the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit to organize the Olympic tournament. The Paris 2024 Boxing Unit relied on the IBA’s established eligibility requirements, drafted after the 2016 Rio Games, which had allowed Khelif and Lin to compete. Those same requirements also allowed the two women to compete in the 2020 Olympic Games, where Khelif finished in fifth place and Lin finished ninth. Khelif’s second-round Olympic victory over Carini sparked predictable if dispiriting outcry from ultra-conservative politicians and anti-transgender influencers. Khelif must be a “a male.” (She’s not.) Or she’s “transgender.” (Again, she’s not. In fact, it’s illegal in Algeria to identify as such.) Others have claimed Khelif’s “biological advantages” are “unfair.” But aren’t the Olympic Games meant to showcase biological advantages? Whether it’s Simone Biles’ ability to leap 12 feet off the ground during her floor routine, or swimmer Katie Ledecky owning all 20 of the fastest women’s 1,500-meter freestyle times in history, no one gets to the top without superlative athletic gifts. Left out of the discussion was the fact that Khelif did what boxers are supposed to do: hit their opponents hard enough that they can’t hit back. Lin’s fights, which ended with decisions in her favor, were less controversial. But they’ve nevertheless spurred further debate about who should be allowed to compete in women’s sports. The Paris Games are the closest the Olympics have come to gender parity: 49% of all Olympic athletes this year are women. Boxing has been among the slowest sports to add opportunities for women. Women first competed in Olympic boxing at the 2012 London Games, under just three weight classes. In comparison, men fought in 10 different weight categories. The 2016 Rio Games saw the same disparity. By the 2020 Games, there were five categories for women and eight for men. This year’s Games include six weight classes for women and seven for men. Sport’s binary organization isn’t perfect, but it is important. Research finds that, on average, elite male athletes outperform elite female athletes by about 10% to 12%. The wonderful strides made in women’s sports would likely be undone by eliminating gender categories. At the same time, the ways sports governing bodies define and police those categories not only disadvantage gender-diverse athletes, but also cast aspersions on any female athlete who may strike someone as “masculine” – in performance, appearance or otherwise. To return to the issue of protection: Who or what do sex-based regulations protect? Do they protect a never-level, level playing field? The indefinable category of “woman?” Or women’s safety in an unsafe sport? Sport itself? We don’t really know what criteria the IBA used to disqualify Khelif and Lin, although there is plenty of speculation. But these are personal, intimate details that, in my view, should be respected and remain private. What we do know is that the furor has far-reaching consequences. Khelif has begged for the hateful discourse to stop: “It can destroy people, it can kill people’s thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people.” It already has. At a Games that has so brilliantly showcased and celebrated female Olympians, I see the debate over Khelif and Lin as distracting as it is heartbreaking. Above all, both boxers are human beings who don’t deserve to be made into political punching bags.

Elizabeth Taylor and Faye Dunaway Made Star Power Into an Art,"Elizabeth Taylor and Faye Dunaway Made Star Power Into an Art — These HBO Docs Prove It   By Daniel D'Addario  There’s something that unites the recent documentaries “Faye” and “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes.” It isn’t just that both played on HBO — “Faye” launched in July, while “Elizabeth Taylor” is to premiere August 3 — or that both center the stories of legendary, Oscar-winning performers. Faye is, of course, Faye Dunaway, of “Network” and “Chinatown,” while Elizabeth Taylor, one of the most decadently media-hounded figures of the 20th Century, practically needs no introduction at all.  What the films share, though, is a poignant and sometimes painful double yearning. In the documentaries, Dunaway — still with us at age 83, and interviewed recently for this film — and Taylor — who died in 2011 but whose “lost tapes” catalogue an extensive 1964 debriefing with journalist Richard Meryman —  both express doubt, anxiety and even shame for career missteps, misbegotten projects and the ways in which their private troubles played out in public view. The viewer feels for them, first because they are human, and then because their manner of expressing their emotions is so extravagantly more than human. That’s the other yearning at the heart of these documentaries: a sense that the culture can no longer produce great actresses who are, too, stars who glitter quite this brightly.  Both films, happily, are stuffed full of film clips, and both give a sense of their respective subjects’ styles. In director Laurent Bouzereau’s curation in “Faye,” Dunaway, at her best, uses a bracing sense of control in order to shock the viewer all the more when she snaps in grand fashion. (The famous photograph of her the morning after winning her Oscar — used as the featured image in this column — in which she’s gazing into the middle distance, is a supreme example of her powers: We’re seeing, through exhaustion and exhilaration, a woman in utter control of the image she wants to present.) In interviews with the press, Dunaway, while seeming to hold her feelings back, has a relentless erudition and quickness that makes clear just how much of herself was in “Network’s” brilliant executive, or “Chinatown’s” tricky femme fatale. Her interview for the documentary feels like a sort of letting-go, an unburdening of thoughts she might have withheld from the press to this point. But the clarity of thought remains intact.   Meanwhile, filmmaker Nanette Burstein shows Taylor, for all the outsizedness of her fame, carrying herself on screen with a funny self-deprecation, a shrewdness that feels decades ahead of her time. We’re told that Taylor was 32 when she played the fiftysomething Martha in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” and while her physical transformation for the role is indeed impressive, it’s the changes to her soul and bearing — her willingness to flaunt her signs of age in a sort of ironic self-deprecation — that feels most remarkable. And both actors are startingly open about career and personal setbacks they faced, including the public’s coming to pigeonhole them. Dunaway speaks about her bipolar diagnosis and her struggles with alcohol, both things that derailed her ability to trust her great gift, her clear and precise thinking. (Both, also, led to her outsized reputation as a difficult colleague — her composure giving way to a great break isn’t just something that happened for Dunaway onscreen.) And we also get an unpacking of why “Mommie Dearest” — the infamous bomb that toppled her career — was such a severe disappointment. Dunaway believed she was really finding something sharp and true in her depiction of Joan Crawford as an abusive mother, and lost herself in the role so deeply that she couldn’t find her way, in the absence of a surer directorial hand, to coherence. Others who speak in “Faye,” including her son, are better-situated than is Dunaway to judge why it is that she takes a particular project’s failure so hard. Publicity-shy even despite her doing a sweeping interview toward the end of her life, Dunaway poured her personal setbacks and challenges into her work. To reject it, perhaps, is to reject her. Meanwhile, Taylor speaks with sharp frankness about, for instance, her dislike of the film “Butterfield 8” (for which she won her first Oscar, which Taylor credits to sympathy for health struggles she was undergoing) and the dramas of filming “Cleopatra,” which she shot with Richard Burton, one of the loves of her life. Taylor and Burton — two stars of exaggerated appetites, talents and passions — strode atop the world. But their notoriety came with its own frustrations for someone who’d wanted, first, to tell stories: “It’s a losing game!,” Taylor tells Meryman. “People already have a set image. They want to believe either the good or the bad. And if you try and explain, then you lose yourself along the way.”  And we see Taylor’s performance of herself as someone increasingly willing to display her frustration with the press. Asked, at a joint press conference with Burton, about her relationship with ex-husband Eddie Fisher, Taylor snaps “Do you read the papers, love? I suggest you do,” then rolls her eyes and tosses her head back. Later, she tells a journalist from “60 Minutes” that “fighting is one of the greatest exercises in marital togetherness”; when the journalist asks if Burton dominates her in their marriage, she widens those famous eyes and blurts “You must be joking!” That it seems almost like an impulse, rather than the ongoing press approach of someone eager to communicate her weariness with the press’ rapaciousness, is a sign of just how gifted an actress Taylor was.  “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes” constructs, methodically, a case for Taylor as a genius both of performing onscreen and at performing for a sort of media that no longer exists. Both Dunaway, an actress who made a point of revealing as little as possible, and Taylor, one who was willing to give it all away — but with a wink that made the consumer aware that she saw herself being consumed — existed in a media climate both rougher and more predictable than today’s.  That media climate was cruel and heartbreaking to those who became its subjects; it also made legends. No one, likely, would trade today’s way of writing about actresses, for all its flaws, for the way Dunaway and Taylor were written about. And yet other aspects of the culture were better-situated to create legends. Dunaway, reflecting, begins to see, in the work she made, an impact on the world; Taylor leveraged her fame not merely for movieland success but for charitable pursuits astounding in their magnitude and timeliness. (In an exceptional clip in the Taylor documentary, Taylor explains why she began fundraising for the fight against AIDS: Few were speaking out or doing anything, and, she says, “it so angered me that I thought, ‘Bitch, do something yourself!’”) We don’t make stars the way we did in Dunaway and Taylor’s era these days. And that’s a good thing. But, for all the ascendant actors who compel in their own ways, watching these women, in two very strong entries in the celebrity-tells-all canon, can convince a viewer, for a moment, that we don’t, anymore, make them at all. “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes” premieres on HBO and Max on Aug. 3; “Faye” is streaming on Max.

Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt's upcoming film 'The Fall Guy' is being severely criticised for featuring a joke about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's marriage.,"Ryan Gosling’s The Fall Guy under fire over inappropriate joke involving Johnny Depp and Amber Heard  Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt’s The Fall Guy is yet to release in the theatres, but it has already come under scanner for all the wrong reasons. The Hollywood film is receiving a lot of backlash for featuring a joke about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's “abusive marriage”. (Also read – The Fall Guy movie review: Ryan Gosling, Emily Blunt rise to the occasion in this breezy, bumpy adventure) In the action comedy film, which has been directed by David Leitch, actor Hannah Waddingham’s character, Gail Meyer, at one point makes a reference to Johnny and Amber‘s turbulent relationship, which has caused a stir among viewers. In the scene, Waddingham, who is essaying the role of an executive producer in the movie, walks into a trailer while looking rumpled and tells director Jody Moreno, essayed by Emily, “It’s like Amber and Johnny were just in here”. The line of dialogue has caused some discourse among viewers who have watched the film at screenings. They are taking to social media to express their dismay. The estranged celebrity couple accused each other of domestic violence and abuse since their split in 2016. “Domestic violence is not a joke,” wrote one X user, with one sharing, “As a survivor I can tell you there is not one thing funny about domestic abuse. I will not support this film. Do better Hollywood”. “Oh wow…domestic violence is now a punchline? Disgusting,” wrote another netizen. One user called the joke as “terrible and tasteless”. “That’s basically a throwaway comment muttered under breath, but it earned absolutely ZERO laughs in my screening,” shared the social media user. Several Hollywood portals reached out to Universal Pictures, The Fall Guy’s distributor, for a comment. However, they have not yet responded to the same. After tying the knot in 2015, Johnny and Amber ended their marital union in 15 months. However, it was not a smooth ending as their split caught the public eye in 2019 when Johnny sued his ex-wife for defamation. In 2018, Amber published a Washington Post op-ed about domestic violence. Though she didn't mention him by name in the article, Johnny claimed it came with hints at him. It led to a court battle, which included both actors making allegations of physical, emotional and mental abuse against each other. In December 2022, the legal battle ended with the Pirates of the Caribbean star winning all three defamation claims and millions in damages. Heard also brought a countersuit against Depp, in which she won one of three defamation claims and was awarded $2 million in damages.

BJP MP Anurag had said, “Those whose caste is not known, talk about the caste census.” without taking anyone’s name. He later stated, “I had said that someone who doesn't know about caste talks about census. I did not name anyone.” Rahul, who had promised a nationwide census if INDIA bloc came into power, replied, “You can insult me as much as you like but we will pass the caste census in Parliament.

However, he will have to relinquish one seat in the coming days.

Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III assumed direct oversight of the case and effectively put the death penalty back on the table.,"Defense Secretary Revokes Plea Deal for Accused Sept. 11 Plotters                                                    Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III assumed direct oversight of the case and effectively put the death penalty back on the table. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Carol Rosenberg Reporting from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III on Friday overruled the overseer of the war court at Guantánamo Bay and revoked a plea agreement reached earlier this week with the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and two alleged accomplices. The Pentagon announced the decision with a memorandum relieving the senior Defense Department official responsible for military commissions of her oversight of the capital case against Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and his alleged accomplices for the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York City, at the Pentagon and in a Pennsylvania field. The overseer, retired Brig. Gen. Susan K. Escallier, signed a pretrial agreement on Wednesday with Mr. Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi that exchanged guilty pleas for sentences of at most life in prison. In taking away the authority, Mr. Austin assumed direct oversight of the case and canceled the agreement, effectively reinstating it as a death-penalty case. He left Ms. Escallier in the role of oversight of Guantánamo’s other cases. ADVERTISEMENT Because of the stakes involved, the “responsibility for such a decision should rest with me,” Mr. Austin said in an order released Friday night by the Pentagon. “Effective immediately, in the exercise of my authority, I hereby withdraw from the three pretrial agreements that you signed on July 31, 2024.” The crime. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, and four other defendants are facing charges in a U.S. military tribunal at Guantánamo Bay of aiding the hijackings that killed nearly 3,000 people. The charges carry the death penalty. The trial. The defendants were arraigned in 2012, but the case has been mired in pretrial proceedings, much of them focused on the C.I.A.’s torture of the defendants. The role of torture. In 2021, a military judge in Guantanamo's other capital case threw out key evidence because that prisoner was tortured. Defense lawyers in the Sept. 11 case are challenging the same type of evidence, and seeking to have either the case or possibility of a death penalty dismissed because of torture. The plea deal. A Pentagon official authorized a plea agreement meant to resolve the case with lifetime sentences for Mohammed and two other defendants. But Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin abruptly canceled the deal, reviving the possibility that they could someday face a death penalty trial. Defense lawyers are now challenging Austin’s rescindment as unlawful, or simply too late. The defendants in the plea deal. Along with Mohammed, Walid bin Attash is accused of training two of the hijackers, researching flights and timetables and testing the ability of a passenger to hide a razor knife on flights. Mustafa al-Hawsawi is accused of helping some of the hijackers with finances and travel arrangements. The other defendants. Ammar al-Baluchi is accused of transferring money from the United Arab Emirates to some of the hijackers in the United States. He chose not to join the plea agreement and could face trial alone. Ramzi bin al-Shibh was accused of helping to organize a cell of hijackers in Germany. In 2023, he was found medically incompetent to stand trial and removed from the case. He could someday face trial if his mental health is restored. Mr. Austin’s decision brought relief to family members of victims who had expressed anger over the deal, but it also left uncertain the next steps of the prosecution over America’s deadliest terrorist attack. Before this week’s developments, jury selection in the 12- to 18-month trial was not envisioned to start before 2026, meaning a verdict was likely to be years away. The case had become mired in more than a decade of pretrial proceedings that focused on whether the detainees’ torture in secret C.I.A. prisons had contaminated the evidence against them. With the plea deal upended, the military judge, Col. Matthew N. McCall, is likely to resume hearing testimony next week. He had been working toward deciding a series of challenges brought by defense lawyers, including whether to exclude confessions that were key to the government’s case. ADVERTISEMENT Ms. Escallier’s approval of the plea agreement, which was reached between prosecutors and the defendants over two years of negotiations, had appeared to resolve the long-running case of the men, who have been in U.S. custody since 2003. The military judge was preparing to question Mr. Mohammed, possibly as soon as Wednesday, about whether he understood and voluntarily agreed with the plea. Mr. Austin was traveling abroad at the time the deal was approved and returned to the United States later that day. By then, prosecutors in the case had told family members of those killed in the attacks about the agreement, and some reacted with disappointment and anger that a death sentence was no longer possible. On Friday, those families expressed appreciation for Mr. Austin’s intervention. “This is a really welcome development,” said Terry Strada, whose husband, Tom Strada, a bond broker, was killed at the World Trade Center. “I’m happy to see the Pentagon getting involved. And glad the death penalty is back on the table. Otherwise, how could we be assured some administration would not commute their sentence or swap them in the future?” “Thank god,” said Kathleen Vigiano, a former police officer whose New York police detective husband, Joseph, and firefighter brother-in-law, John, were both killed at the World Trade Center. She said she had long been eager for a Sept. 11 trial to answer questions about “how this was planned, and who knew what.” ADVERTISEMENT She called the announcement a gift for the family, which was celebrating the 84th birthday of her husband and brother-in-law’s mother, Jeanette Vigiano. “It was a great birthday present for her,” she said. Mr. Austin’s action was met with disbelief by lawyers at Guantánamo Bay, who had negotiated the plea deal across 27 months, even as they were preparing for an eventual trial. “I am respectfully and profoundly disappointed that after all of these years the government still has not learned the lessons of this case, and the mischief that results from disregarding due process and fair play,” said Gary D. Sowards, Mr. Mohammed’s lead lawyer. A senior Pentagon official said that the decision was the secretary’s alone, and that the White House had no involvement. The official said Mr. Austin had never supported a plea deal and wanted the military commission trials to proceed. Republican leaders had been pushing to overturn the deal. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the longtime Republican leader, called the agreement “a revolting abdication of the government’s responsibility to defend America and provide justice.” ADVERTISEMENT Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas called the deal “disgraceful and an insult to the victims of the attacks,” and introduced legislation intended to nullify it. But Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, hailed the plea agreement as a “small measure of justice and finality to the victims and their loved ones.” Ms. Escallier, the official who approved the agreement, had been on the job for less than a year. She had been a career Army lawyer who retired in 2021 after 32 years of service. She provided legal advice on the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and other issues there, and she was the senior lawyer in the subsequent campaign to defeat the Islamic State. Although Mr. Austin relieved her of oversight of the Sept. 11 case, he left her in charge of the other cases at Guantánamo Bay, including the other capital case, against a man who is accused of plotting Al Qaeda’s bombing of the U.S.S. Cole warship. The military judge in that case has set an October 2025 trial date for the defendant, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the attack, which killed 17 U.S. sailors off Yemen.

"In the seven days after President Biden stepped down as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Harris campaign raked in $200 million.","Harris Campaign Says It Raised $310 Million in July, More Than Double Trump’s Haul                                                    In the seven days after President Biden stepped down as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Harris campaign raked in $200 million. By Theodore Schleifer Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign survived a brutal few weeks of fund-raising in July to bounce back so dramatically before the end of the month that she more than doubled the amount of money raised by former President Donald J. Trump, her campaign announced on Friday. The Harris campaign, which for the first 20 days of July was the Biden campaign, said it had raised $310 million during the month, including $200 million in just seven days after President Biden dropped out of the race. The Trump campaign and its own allies said on Thursday that they had collected $139 million in July, an enormous sum but well short of what the Harris campaign said it had brought in amid a huge burst of enthusiasm about her candidacy. The Harris campaign raised almost as much in July as the Biden campaign had raised in March, April, May and June combined. The surge in fund-raising has allowed Democrats, for the first time in months, to have a cash-on-hand advantage over Republicans. The Harris campaign said it now had $377 million in its war chest, in contrast to the $327 million that the Trump campaign has said it has. ADVERTISEMENT Neither campaign disclosed precisely how much of the money was raised or held by the campaigns themselves versus their allied party committees. Democrats’ fund-raising was said to have plummeted in the first three weeks of the month, in the aftermath of Mr. Biden’s disastrous debate, although precise figures were not known or released by the Biden campaign. But after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, the fund-raising spigot was opened wide. The $200 million that the Harris campaign said it had raised in the week after Mr. Biden ended his re-election bid was more than Mr. Biden’s haul in the first three months of the year. The Trump campaign’s own fund-raising was strong — and most likely would have far outstripped the Democrats’ had the party not changed its standard-bearer. The $139 million raised in July amounted to one of the Trump team’s strongest fund-raising months to date, just off the sum raised in May, when Mr. Trump’s supporters responded to his felony conviction with $141 million in donations. After collecting $112 million in June, donations for the Trump team ticked up in July as Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt, was formally nominated at the Republican convention in Milwaukee and picked Senator JD Vance of Ohio to be his running mate — events that surely motivated his donors and supporters. July was the second straight month in which Democrats out-raised the Trump team. In June, when Mr. Biden was still atop the ticket, his campaign raised $127 million and ended the month with $240 million on hand, all before the history-making events that would unfold over the next four weeks.

"The Pennsylvania governor, a top contender to be Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, wrote in his college newspaper that Palestinians were “too battle-minded.”","Palestinians ‘too battle-minded’: Gov. Shapiro’s college article prompts backlash  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s college newspaper article from 1993 resurfaced this week and has caused considerable backlash - with some taking offense to his claim that Palestinians are “too battle-minded” to coexist with Israel, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.  Shapiro has made a number of headlines recently as he is thought to be among Vice President Kamala Harris's picks for a potential running mate in her presidential bid. The article ‘Peace not possible,’ published in the University of Rochester’s Campus Times, is now three decades old. It expressed opinions contradicting the official’s current stance. One key issue is that he now claims to support a two-state solution and, by extension, the establishment of a Palestinian state. At 20 years old, Shapiro claimed, “Using history as precedent, peace between Arabs and Israelis is virtually impossible and will never come.” “Palestinians will not coexist peacefully,” Shapiro wrote. “They do not have the capabilities to establish their own homeland and make it successful even with the aid of Israel and the United States. They are too battle-minded to be able to establish a peaceful homeland of their own.” The article pre-dated Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, which was subsequently taken over by the Hamas terror group. The article also predated the signing of the Abraham Accords. Shapiro’s spokesperson, Manuel Bonder, told the Inquirer that the governor’s stance has changed and confirmed that Shapiro fully backs a two-state solution. “Governor Shapiro has built close, meaningful, informative relationships with many Muslim-American, Arab-American, Palestinian Christian, and Jewish community leaders all across Pennsylvania,” Bonder said. “The governor greatly values their perspectives and the experiences he has learned from over the years — and as a result, as with many issues, his views on the Middle East have evolved into the position he holds today.” “I was 20,” Shapiro said at a conference in Delaware County. “I have said for years, years before October 7, that I favor a two-state solution — Israelis and Palestinians living peacefully side-by-side, being able to determine their own futures and their own destiny.” Store and/or access information on a device.

Proud host of Wikipedia and its sister sites   The International Seabed Authority (ISA) (French: Autorité internationale des fonds marins) is a Kingston, Jamaica-based intergovernmental body of 167 member states and the European Union. It was established under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and its 1994 Agreement on Implementation. The ISA's dual mission is to authorize and control the development of mineral related operations in the international seabed,[3][4] which is considered the ""common heritage of all mankind"",[5][6] and to protect the ecosystem of the seabed, ocean floor and subsoil in ""The Area"" beyond national jurisdiction. The ISA is responsible for safeguarding the international deep sea, defined as waters below 200 meters (656 feet), where photosynthesis is hampered by inadequate light.[7] Governing approximately half of the total area of the world's oceans, the ISA oversees activities that might threaten biological diversity and harm the marine environment.[8] Since its inception in 1994, the ISA has approved over two dozen ocean floor mining exploration contracts in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.[9][10] The majority of these contracts are for exploration in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone between Hawaii and Mexico, where polymetallic nodules contain copper, cobalt and other minerals essential for powering electric batteries. To date, the Authority has not authorized any commercial mining contracts as it continues to deliberate over regulations amid global calls for a moratorium on deep sea mining. Scientists and environmentalists warn that such mining could wreak havoc on the ocean, a crucial carbon sink and home to rare and diverse species.[11][12] Funded by UNCLOS members and mining contractors, the Authority operates as an autonomous international organization with its own Assembly, Council, and Secretariat. The current Secretary-General of the agency is Michael Lodge, who was elected in 2016.[13] On August 2, 2024, the ISA voted 79-34 to remove Lodge from his position because of his ties to private industry.[11] Oceanographer Leticia Carvalho was elected to replace Lodge and will serve as the Secretary-General from 2025 to 2028.[14] The Authority held its inaugural meeting in its host country, Jamaica, on 16 November 1994,[15] the day the Convention came into force. The articles governing the Authority have been made ""noting the political and economic changes, including market-oriented approaches, affecting the implementation"" of the convention.[16] The Authority obtained its observer status to the United Nations in October 1996.[17] The Authority has 167 members and the European Union, composed of all parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.[6] The Authority operates by contracting with private and public corporations and other entities authorizing them to explore, and potentially exploit, specified areas on the deep seabed for mineral resources, such as cobalt, nickel and manganese.[18][12] Under UNCLOS, Part XI, Section 2. ""The Area and its resources are the common heritage of mankind."" As a result, ISA must ensure that activities in the Area are undertaken only for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all humankind, with economic benefits shared equitably and special consideration given to the needs of developing nations.[19] Along with a Secretary-General, two principal organs establish the policies and govern the work of the Authority: the Assembly, in which all UNCLOS parties are represented, and a 36-member Council elected by the Assembly.[20] The Assembly elects a Secretary-General to serve a four-year term as the ISA's chief administrative officer, oversee Authority staff and issue an annual report to the Assembly. The Secretary-General is prohibited from holding a financial interest in any mining operations authorized by the Authority.[20] There have been three Secretary-Generals since ISA's creation in 1996: In August 2024 the ISA Assembly elected the oceanographer Leticia Carvalho of Brazil as Secretary-General for the term 2025−-2028.[23][24] The Assembly, which consists of all members of the Authority, elects the 36-member Council, as well as the Secretary-General from among candidates the Council recommends. The Assembly also has the power to approve or reject the council's recommendations for the following: rules and regulations governing seabed mining, distribution of financial benefits accrued from authorized mining and the Authority's annual budget.[20] The 36-member Council, elected by the Assembly, authorizes contracts with governments and private corporations to explore and mine the international seabed and sets rules and procedures, subject to the Assembly's approval, for ISA governance. The council also nominates a Secretary-General, who then must be elected by the full Assembly to serve a four-year term. The ISA's annual plenary sessions, which usually last two weeks, are held in Kingston.[25] Also established is a 30-member Legal and Technical Commission which advises the Council and a 15-member Finance Committee that deals with budgetary and related matters. All members are experts nominated by governments and elected to serve in their individual capacity.[26][27] The convention also established a body called the Enterprise which is to serve as the Authority's own mining operator, potentially generating ""hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties"" to be shared with developing nations.""[28][11] The environmental organization Greenpeace has expressed concerns over the ISA's alleged conflict of interest as both regulator and business operator, though the ISA denies the conflict of interest charge.[11] The Authority has a Secretariat of 37 authorized posts and a 2022 biennial budget of approximately $10,000,000.[29] UNCLOS defines the international seabed area—the part under ISA jurisdiction—as ""the seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction""[30] UNCLOS outlines the areas of national jurisdiction as a ""12 nautical-mile territorial sea; an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 nautical miles and a continental shelf"",[31] unless a nation can demonstrate that its continental shelf is naturally prolonged beyond that limit, in which case it may claim up to 350 nautical miles (650 km).[32] ISA has no role in determining this boundary. Rather, this task is left to another body established by UNCLOS, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which examines scientific data submitted by coastal states that claim a broader reach.[33] Although the ISA has yet to approve commercial mining contracts, the Authority anticipates commercial mining could begin as early as 2023–2024 with the completion of much-debated ISA regulations.[11][35] In 2021, the Pacific Island nation of Nauru triggered a deadline that requires the ISA to approve final commercial mining regulations by July 2023 or allow contractors to mine under existing draft regulations.[35] Exploratory mining involves ""deep-sea mapping, manned submersibles or remotely-operated vehicles, photographic and video systems, and drilling devices.""[36] Most areas of exploration are in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), in the Equatorial North Pacific Ocean, south and southeast of Hawaii, between Hawaii and Mexico. The quiet CCZ, as wide as the continental U.S., is home to polymetallic nodules or trillions of potato-size lumps of matter formed over millions of years that contain nickel, manganese, copper, zinc and cobalt, as well as deep water coral, sponges and unusual species (""ghost octopus"", crustaceans, worms and sea cucumbers) that in a near light-less environment attach to the rock-like nodules for shelter.[37][34] Contractors want to mine polymetallic nodules for battery storage for electric vehicles, smartphones, and solar and wind energy.[35][38][39] Exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules have also been issued for contractors operating in the Central Indian Ocean Basin and Western Pacific Ocean.[40] The ISA has issued exploration contracts for polymetallic sulphides in the South West Indian Ridge, Central Indian Ridge and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,[40] and contracts for exploration for cobalt-rich crusts in the Western Pacific Ocean.[40] Each contractor is required to develop a contingency plan should something go wrong during exploration, report annually on its activities in its assigned area and propose a training program for developing countries .[40] The ISA has signed 15-year contracts for exploration with 22 contractors seeking polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the deep seabed.[41] In 2001-2002 the ISA signed contracts with Yuzhmorgeologya (Russian Federation); Interoceanmetal Joint Organization (IOM) (Bulgaria, Cuba, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Russian Federation); the Government of the Republic of Korea; China Ocean Minerals Research and Development Association (COMRA) (China); Deep Ocean Resources Development Company (DORD) (Japan); Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer (IFREMER) (France); the Government of India. In 2006, the Authority signed a 15-year contract with the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany.[42][43] In 2008, the Authority received two new applications for authorization to explore for polymetallic nodules, coming for the first time from private firms in developing island nations of the Pacific. Sponsored by their respective governments, they were submitted by Nauru Ocean Resources Inc.[44] and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited.[45] A 15-year exploration contract was granted by the Authority to Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. on 22 July 2011 and to Tonga Offshore Mining Limited on 12 January 2012.[46] Fifteen-year exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules were also granted to G-TECH Sea Mineral Resources NV (Belgium) on 14 January 2013; Marawa Research and Exploration Ltd (Kiribati) on 19 January 2015; Ocean Mineral Singapore Pte Ltd on 22 January 2015; UK Seabed Resources Ltd (two contracts on 8 February 2013 and 29 March 2016 respectively); Cook Islands Investment Corporation on 15 July 2016 and more recently China Minmetals Corporation on 12 May 2017.[42] The Authority has signed seven contracts for the exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the South West Indian Ridge, Central Indian Ridge and Mid-Atlantic Ridge with China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (18 November 2011); the Government of Russia (29 October 2012); Government of the Republic of Korea (24 June 2014); Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer (Ifremer, France, 18 November 2014); the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany (6 May 2015); and the Government of India (26 September 2016) and the Government of the Republic of Poland (12 February 2018).[47] The Authority holds five contracts for the exploration of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the Western Pacific Ocean with China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (29 April 2014); Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC, 27 January 2014); Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (10 March 2015), Companhia De Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais (9 November 2015) and the Government of the Republic of Korea (27 March 2018).[48][49] Environmentalists, scientists from 44 countries, Google, BMW and Volvo, World Wildlife Fund and several Pacific nations, including Fiji and Papua New Guinea, have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until more scientific research is conducted on its impact on the marine environment.[50][9][51] Advocates for deep sea mining argue extraction of rare metals is critical for electric car batteries necessary to develop a fossil-free economy.[50] Opponents argue seabed mining could wreak havoc on the world's oceans, which act as a carbon sink absorbing a quarter of the world's carbon emissions each year.[52] The environmental organization Greenpeace has raised objections about deep seabed mining disrupting the habitats of newly reported species, from crabs to whales to snails that survive without eating and congregate near bioluminescent thermal vents.[53] Greenpeace has urged the ISA to further develop UNCLOS' foundational Article 136 principle ""of common heritage to all mankind"" to revise regulations and set conservation targets. In a 2018 Greenpeace Research Laboratories report the organization stressed the importance of protecting marine biodiversity from toxins released during seabed mining for natural gas and rare metals for photovoltaic cells.[54] Greenpeace maintains the ""pro-exploitation"" ISA is not the appropriate authority to regulate deep sea mining (DSM). In 2019 Greenpeace activists protested outside the annual meeting of the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica, calling for a global ocean treaty to ban deep sea mining in ocean sanctuaries.[55] Some of the activists had sailed to Jamaica aboard Greenpeace's ship, the Esperanza, which travelled from the ""Lost City in the mid-Atlantic"", an area Greenpeace says is threatened by exploratory mining the ISA authorized.[56] ISA Secretary-General Michael Lodge said Greenpeace's support for a global ocean treaty, not the ISA, to control deep sea mining did not make sense.[57] In 2022, The Guardian reported the ISA failed to renew the contract for Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB), a division of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), which covered past proceedings to maintain an independent record of the ISA. The decision came amid warnings from scientists that commercial ocean floor mining ""would be “dangerous”, “reckless” and “irreversible” in its harm to the ecosystem. In its defense, the ISA said ENB's non-renewal was triggered by budget cuts. The Guardian also reported that Germany and environmentalists had raised questions about the lack of transparency by the ISA's Legal and Technical Commission (LTC), which conducts closed meetings to set standards and issue guidelines for seabed mining.[51] In response to criticism, ISA Secretary-General Michael Lodge defended ISA as a ""transparent public forum of consensus-building.""[57] In 2022, the Los Angeles Times reported that the International Seabed Authority faced criticisms over conflicts of interest.[11] The LA Times reported that the ISA was scheduled to approve seabed mining, despite concerns by scientists and environmentalists about the environmental impact.[11] ISA head Michael Lodge had criticized these groups, saying there was ""a growing environmental absolutism and dogmatism bordering on fanaticism"" and arguing that seabed mining was ""predictable and manageable"".[11] Scientists and members of Lodge's staff objected to Lodge's appearance in a mining company video seeking investments in robotic exploration for minerals to manufacture electric vehicles. In the video, Lodge said his agency supported a 15-year exploration contract because ""land-based resources are becoming increasingly difficult to access.""[11] The exact nature of the ISA's mission and authority has been questioned by opponents of the Law of the Sea Treaty who are generally skeptical of multilateral engagement by the United States.[58] In 2007, although the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted in favor of treaty ratification, the full Senate failed to ratify the treaty, with some Republicans arguing UNCLOS might threaten national security by interfering with ocean military operations and hinder seabed mining corporations by imposing environmental regulations.[59][60] One of the main anti-ratification arguments being a charge that the ISA is flawed or unnecessary. In its original form, the Convention included certain provisions that some found objectionable, such as: Because of these concerns, the United States pushed for modification of the Convention, obtaining a 1994 Agreement on Implementation that somewhat mitigates them and thus modifies the ISA's authority.[63] Despite this change the United States has not ratified the Convention and so is not a member of ISA, although it sends sizable delegations to participate in meetings as an observer.[64] As an observer, not an UNCLOS signatory, the U.S. will not be allowed to vote on approval of final commercial mining regulations and will be unable to sponsor companies to apply for contracts in international waters. This is because the ISA requires contractors be sponsored by a state that is a signatory to UNCLOS. U.S.-based military contractor Lockheed Martin, however, is participating in two British deep sea mining projects.[35] Palau was the first country to call for a moratorium, or precautionary pause, on deep-sea mining until the impact of such a practice is better understood.[65] By July 10, 2023, 17 countries had called for a deep-sea mining moratorium or pause, including Germany, New Zealand, Spain, France, Sweden, Fiji, and the Federated States of Micronesia.[66] On July 29, 2024, President Surangel S. Whipps Jr. of Palau delivered an address titled ""Upholding the Common Heritage of Humankind"" to the 29th General Assembly of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in Kingston, Jamaica. In his speech, President Whipps emphasized the importance of safeguarding the deep ocean from exploitation and modern-day colonialism. He highlighted Palau’s deep cultural and economic ties to the ocean and reiterated the call for an immediate moratorium on deep-sea mining, citing the associated environmental risks and uncertainties. In his speech he referred to the ocean as ""Our greatest ally in our fight against climate change,"" highlighting its role as the largest carbon sink on the planet. He underscored the critical role deep ocean ecosystems play in global environmental health and advocated for prioritizing long-term sustainability over short-term economic gains. He urged the assembly to act responsibly on behalf of future generations, reinforcing the deep seabed’s status as the ""common heritage of (hu)mankind.""[67][68][69] The number of countries against the imminent start of mining for metallic nodules on the seafloor increased to 32 during the 29th ISA annual assembly, with Austria, Guatemala, Honduras, Malta, and Tuvalu joining the list.[70] The Authority's main legislative accomplishment has been the adoption, in the year 2000, of regulations governing exploration for polymetallic nodules.[71][72] These resources, also called manganese nodules, contain varying amounts of manganese, cobalt, copper and nickel. They occur as potato-sized lumps scattered about on the surface of the ocean floor, mainly in the central Pacific Ocean in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone but with some deposits in the Indian Ocean. In 2013, the ISA approved amendments to its Mining Code on deep sea exploration, stating a prospector should take a precautionary approach to avoid polluting the ocean and should immediately inform the Secretary-General of any prospect-related incidents that threaten the marine environment. The amended regulations also said a contractor can recover ""a reasonable amount of material"" for testing but not for sale.[73] In July 2019, the ISA's Legal and Trade Commission prepared ""Draft regulations on exploitation of mineral resources in the Area.""[74] In 2010, the ISA adopted Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Sulphides.[75][73] In 2012, the Authority adopted Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Cobalt-Rich Ferromanganese Crusts.[75][73] The Council of the Authority began work in August 2002 on another set of regulations, covering polymetallic sulfides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, which are rich sources of such minerals as copper, iron, zinc, silver and gold, as well as cobalt. The sulphides are found around volcanic hot springs, especially in the western Pacific Ocean, while the crusts occur on oceanic ridges and elsewhere at several locations around the world. The Council decided in 2006 to prepare separate sets of regulations for sulphides and for crusts, with priority given to sulphides. It devoted most of its sessions in 2007 and 2008 to this task, but several issues remained unresolved. Chief among these were the definition and configuration of the area to be allocated to contractors for exploration, the fees to be paid to the Authority and the question of how to deal with any overlapping claims that might arise.[76] Meanwhile, the Legal and Technical Commission reported progress on ferromanganese crusts.[77] In addition to its legislative work, the Authority organizes annual workshops on various aspects of seabed exploration, with emphasis on measures to protect the marine environment from any harmful consequences. It disseminates the results of these meetings through publications.[78] Studies over several years covering the key mineral area of the Central Pacific resulted in a technical study on biodiversity, species ranges and gene flow in the abyssal Pacific nodule province, with emphasis on predicting and managing the impacts of deep seabed mining[79] A workshop at Manoa, Hawaii, in October 2007[80] produced a rationale and recommendations for the establishment of ""preservation reference areas"" in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where nodule mining would be prohibited in order to leave the natural environment intact. In recent years, the ISA hosted workshops on enhancing the role of women in conducting deep-sea scientific studies, sustainable management of deep seabed resources, a series for Africa on resources and technologies for DSM and a session on sharing the economic benefits of DSM.[81][82] In recent years, however, interest in deep sea mining, especially with regard to ferromanganese crusts and polymetallic sulphides, has picked up among several firms now operating in waters within the national zones of Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga. Papua New Guinea was the first country in the world to grant commercial exploration licenses for seafloor massive sulphide deposits when it granted the initial license to Nautilus Minerals in 1997. Japan's new ocean policy emphasizes the need to develop methane hydrate and hydrothermal deposits within Japan's exclusive economic zone and calls for the commercialization of these resources within the next 10 years. Reporting on these developments in his annual report to the Authority in April 2008, Secretary-General Nandan referred also to the upward trend in demand and prices for cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese, the main metals that would be derived from seabed mining, and he noted that technologies being developed for offshore extraction could be adapted for deep sea mining.[83] Recently, there has been much interest in the possibility of exploiting seabed resources in the Arctic Ocean, bordered by Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Russia and the United States (see Territorial claims in the Arctic). In 2020, an international coalition of environmental groups urged the government of Norway to not only abandon plans for deep sea mining under national jurisdiction, but to also speak out against DSM Arctic mining before the International Seaboard Authority.[84][85] In 2006 the Authority established an Endowment Fund to Support Collaborative Marine Scientific Research on the International Seabed Area. The Fund will aid experienced scientists and technicians from developing countries to participate in deep-sea research organized by international and national institutions. A campaign was launched in February 2008 to identify participants, establish a network of cooperating bodies and seek outside funds to augment the initial $3 million endowment from the Authority.[86] In 2017, the Authority registered seven voluntary commitments[87] with the UN Oceans Conference for Sustainable Development Goal 14.

Hunter Biden won’t be sentenced on gun charges until after presidential election,"Timeline: Hunter Biden under legal, political scrutiny  Prosecutors have been investigating the president's son since 2018. Six years into a federal probe into his personal and professional life, President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden has been convicted on three felony counts related to his purchase of a firearm in 2018 while allegedly addicted to drugs. U.S. Attorney David Weiss, a Trump-era appointee who has since been elevated to special counsel, indicted the younger Biden on felony gun charges as well as tax-related charges after a plea deal fell apart in a Delaware courtroom in July.  Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill have been investigating the Biden family as part of their impeachment inquiry into the president. Here's a timeline of Hunter Biden's legal and political scrutiny. A month after Joe Biden wins the 2020 presidential election, Hunter Biden announces that federal prosecutors in Delaware are investigating his ""tax affairs."" A source with knowledge of the investigation tells ABC News that the tax probe began in 2018, but that the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware waited to notify Hunter Biden's legal team due to sensitivities around the election. Investigators are looking into Hunter's business dealings in China and elsewhere, including scrutinizing whether he may have committed tax crimes stemming from those overseas business dealings, sources tell ABC News. Outgoing Attorney General William Barr says he doesn't intend to appoint a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden, as President Donald Trump and others have suggested. In a new memoir, Hunter Biden addresses many of the topics that emerged as fodder for his father's political foes during the presidential campaign, including his struggles with substance addiction, his dealings in China, and his seat on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas firm during his father's tenure as vice president -- a role that later led to then-President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial on charges that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden's position on the board. Trump was subsequently acquitted. The memoir, titled ""Beautiful Things,"" also offers lurid details as it chronicles the younger Biden's repeated relapses into drug and alcohol abuse. ABC News reports that the federal investigation into Hunter Biden over his tax affairs has intensified, according to sources. Sources say a number of witnesses have appeared before a grand jury Wilmington, Delaware, in recent months, and have been asked about payments Hunter Biden received while serving on the board of directors of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, as well as about how he paid off tax obligations in recent years. Fresh off the GOP regaining control of the Senate in the midterm elections, congressional Republicans say they're poised to push ahead with an investigation into President Joe Biden's family, including Hunter Biden, in the coming session. Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and James Comer of Kentucky, two high-ranking members expected to helm powerful committees when Republicans take control of Congress in January, pledge to ""pursue all avenues"" of wrongdoing, calling investigations into the president's family a ""top priority."" Ahead of an expected deluge of Republican probes, Hunter Biden retains high-powered defense lawyer Abbe Lowell to help navigate congressional oversight. Testifying in his annual oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Merrick Garland says that U.S. Attorney David Weiss has been told he has ""full authority"" to make any charging decisions stemming from the Hunter Biden investigation, even if that would involve bringing a case in a district outside of Delaware. Garland also says he has pledged to Weiss any resources necessary to conduct his investigation, and has received no reports thus far of the his investigation being stymied in any way by personnel at the main Justice Department. Attorneys for Hunter Biden file counterclaims alleging invasion of privacy in response to a defamation lawsuit brought by Delaware-based computer repairman John Paul Mac Isaac, who they say triggered the infamous laptop controversy in the weeks leading up to the 2020 presidential election. The counterclaim is in response to an ongoing defamation lawsuit against Hunter Biden and others that was filed in October 2019 by Mac Isaac, who Hunter Biden's attorney say obtained and later disseminated data from a laptop allegedly belonging to the younger Biden. ABC News reports that a supervisor at the IRS has told lawmakers that he has information that suggests the Biden administration could be mishandling the investigation into Hunter Biden, according to sources. In a letter to lawmakers obtained by ABC News, the lawyer for the IRS whistleblower says his client is an IRS criminal supervisory special agent ""who has been overseeing the ongoing and sensitive investigation of a high-profile, controversial subject since early 2020 and would like to make protected whistleblower disclosures to Congress."" The letter says that ""The protected disclosures: (1) contradict sworn testimony to Congress by a senior political appointee, (2) involve failure to mitigate clear conflicts of interest in the ultimate disposition of the case, and (3) detail examples of preferential treatment and politics improperly infecting decisions and protocols that would normally be followed by career law enforcement professionals in similar circumstances if the subject were not politically connected."" ABC News reports that the GOP-led House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena demanding the FBI produce a record related to an alleged ""criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Joe Biden and a foreign national."" The subpoena seeks an unclassified FD-1023 document, which is generally defined as a report from an informant. The White House denounces the contents of the document as ""anonymous innuendo."" Attorneys for the IRS whistleblower inform key members of Congress that their client -- along with his ""entire investigative team"" -- has been removed from the probe into the president's son. The Justice Department defers comment to U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who does not comment on the claim. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer announces his intention to initiate contempt of Congress hearings over FBI Director Chris Wray's refusal to physically turn over the FD-1023 document that Republicans believe is related to President Joe Biden. Hunter Biden agrees to plead guilty to a pair of tax-related misdemeanors and enter into a pretrial diversion agreement that would enable him to avoid prosecution on one felony gun charge, potentially ending the yearslong probe. According to the agreement, the younger Biden will acknowledge his failure to pay taxes on income he received in 2017 and 2018, until they were paid in 2020 by a third party, identified by ABC News as attorney and confidant Kevin Morris. In exchange, prosecutors will recommend probation, meaning Hunter Biden will likely avoid prison time. For the gun charge, he will agree to pretrial diversion, with the charge being dropped if he adheres to certain terms. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika sets a court date of July 26 for Hunter Biden to make his initial court appearance related to the plea deal he has agreed to. The GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee releases transcripts of their interviews with two IRS whistleblowers that they say show that senior Biden administration officials stymied U.S. Attorney David Weiss' investigation into Hunter Biden. In their testimony, the whistleblowers claim that senior Justice Department officials blocked prosecutors' attempts to bring charges against Hunter Biden in Washington and California, and refused to grant Weiss special counsel status. Justice Department officials dispute the claim, saying, ""As both the Attorney General and U.S. Attorney David Weiss have said, U.S. Attorney Weiss has full authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when, and whether to file charges as he deems appropriate. He needs no further approval to do so.""  ABC News reports that House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has been given access the redacted FD-1023 document that allegedly contains claims about what Comer calls a ""criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Biden and a foreign national relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions."" But Comer tells reporters that reading the document was ""a total waste of my time,"" as more than half of the document was redacted. Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight panel, says the Trump-era Justice Department investigated the claims and, ""in August 2020, Attorney General [William] Barr and his hand-picked U.S. Attorney signed off on closing the assessment."" Congressional Republicans have also seized on a July 2017 WhatsApp message in which the younger Biden purportedly threatened a Chinese business associate by invoking his father's political connections, allegedly writing, ""I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled. Tell the director that I would like to resolve this now before it gets out of hand, and now means tonight."" ""And, Z, if I get a call or text from anyone involved in this other than you, Zhang, or the chairman, I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge that you will regret not following my direction,"" the message continues. ""I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father."" At the time of the message, Joe Biden's term as vice president had already ended and he held no political office. But Republicans say the message undercuts President Biden's claim that he never discussed overseas business endeavors with his son. Ian Sams, a White House spokesperson, reiterates that ""the president was not in business with his son."" Meanwhile, Attorney General Merrick Garland disputes outright the IRS' whistleblowers' claim that Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney David Weiss had requested to be named a special counsel but was turned down, saying, ""Mr. Weiss never made that request to me."" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, regarding the IRS whistleblowers' claim that Garland turned down Weiss' request to be named a special counsel in the Hunter Biden probe, tells Fox News, ""If it comes true what the IRS whistleblower is saying, we're going to start impeachment inquiries on the attorney general.""  ABC News reports that Weiss has pushed back on the IRS whistleblowers' allegations, writing in a letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham of the Senate Judiciary Committee: ""To clarify an apparent misperception and to avoid future confusion, I wish to make one point clear: in this case, I have not requested Special Counsel designation."" Separately, in an appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray is asked by Rep. Matt Gaetz, ""Are you protecting the Bidens?"" ""Absolutely not,"" Wray answers. Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell sends a cease-and-desist letter to Trump's legal team claiming that Trump's rhetoric on social media and elsewhere ""could lead to [Hunter Biden's] or his family's injury."" ""This is not a false alarm,"" Lowell writes. ""You should make clear to Mr. Trump -- if you have not done so already -- that Mr. Trump's words have caused harm in the past and threaten to do so again if he does not stop."" In congressional testimony, the two IRS whistleblowers -- 14-year IRS veteran Gary Shapley and IRS investigator Joseph Ziegler, who has previously been unidentified -- reiterate their claims that Justice Department officials stymied Weiss' probe of Hunter Biden. ""It appeared to me, based on what I experienced, that the U.S. Attorney in Delaware in our investigation was constantly hamstrung, limited and marginalized by DOJ officials,"" Ziegler says. ""I still think that a special counsel is necessary for this investigation."" In an unusual move, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, releases the FD-1023 document containing a confidential FBI informant's unverified claim that, years ago, the Biden family ""pushed"" a Ukrainian oligarch to pay them millions of dollars. The document cites an unnamed source who says that in 2015, Mykola Zlochevsky, the chief executive of Burisma -- the Ukrainian energy firm that hired Hunter Biden as a board member in 2013 -- claimed that he was ""forced"" to pay Joe and Hunter Biden $5 million each, apparently in exchange for orchestrating the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor named Viktor Shokin who was purportedly investigating Burisma at the time. The assertion that the elder Biden, who was then vice president, acted to have Shokin removed in an effort to protect Burisma has been undercut by widespread criticism of the former Ukrainian prosecutor that led the U.S. State Department itself to seek Shokin's ouster. A White House spokesperson, responding to the document's release, says ""congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.""  Under questioning from reporters, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre reiterates that President Biden ""was never in business with his son."" Hunter Biden appears before U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika to formally agree to the plea deal negotiated in June -- but during a contentious hearing, Judge Noreika defers the deal after taking issue with the structure of the arrangement. Noreika requests additional briefings from the parties before she'll determine next steps. In the meantime, Hunter Biden enters a plea of not guilty. Former Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer testifies before the House Oversight panel, telling legislators that Burisma, through Hunter Biden, benefitted by its association with the so-called ""Biden brand"" -- but that Hunter Biden only provided the ""illusion of access"" to his father and did not discuss his business dealings with him, according to committee members who participated in the closed-door hearing. House Republicans release the complete transcript of Devon Archer's testimony before the Oversight panel, which include his recollection that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone or referenced his father being on the phone in front of business associates ""maybe 20 times"" in the 10 years that Archer and Hunter Biden were business associates -- which included a period when Biden was vice president -- but that Joe Biden's interactions with Hunter Biden's associates were ""not related to commercial business"" and that Joe Biden had no involvement with Burisma or took any actions to benefit Burisma or Hunter Biden, according to the fully transcribed interview with the committee. Archer confirms that he was not aware of any wrongdoing by President Biden, according to the transcription. Attorney General Merrick Garland appoints Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss as special counsel in his investigation of Hunter Biden, after the Trump appointee asked Garland to be appointed special counsel in the case. Weiss says in court documents filed within minutes of his appointment that plea negotiations have reached ""an impasse"" and that he intends to drop the misdemeanor tax charges against Hunter Biden in Delaware and instead bring them in California and Washington, D.C., where prosecutors say the alleged misconduct occurred.  Attorneys for Hunter Biden say in a court filing that federal prosecutors reneged on the plea deal that would have resolved tax and gun charges against Hunter Biden. Despite their acknowledgement that the plea agreement on tax charges is ""moot,"" attorneys for Hunter Biden argue that the second part of the deal -- a diversion agreement on a separate gun charge -- remains in effect, since it is a separate contract negotiated and entered into by the parties outside the judge's purview. In court filings, prosecutors for Weiss push back on Hunter Biden's assertion that they ""reneged"" on the ill-fated plea deal, and dispute defense counsel's claim that the diversion agreement on a gun possession charge remains ""valid and binding."" Court documents filed by special counsel David Weiss say that Weiss intends to bring an indictment against Hunter Biden by the end of the month, pertaining to the felony gun charge that was previously brought under the pretrial diversion agreement brokered by the two parties. Hunter Biden's legal team argues that the pretrial diversion agreement remains in effect. ""We believe the signed and filed diversion agreement remains valid and prevents any additional charges from being filed against Mr. Biden,"" says Abbe Lowell, an attorney for Hunter Biden. ""We expect a fair resolution of the sprawling, 5-year investigation into Mr. Biden that was based on the evidence and the law, not outside political pressure."" Hunter Biden is indicted by special counsel David Weiss on felony charges that he lied on a federal form when he said he was drug-free at the time that he purchased a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver in October 2018. His legal team maintains that the pretrial diversion agreement from July remains in effect, though Weiss' team says it's null and void. ""As expected, prosecutors filed charges today that they deemed were not warranted just six weeks ago following a five-year investigation into this case,"" Hunter Biden attorney Abbe Lowell says in a statement. ""We believe these charges are barred by the agreement the prosecutors made with Mr. Biden, the recent rulings by several federal courts that this statute is unconstitutional, and the facts that he did not violate that law, and we plan to demonstrate all of that in court."" Hunter Biden files a lawsuit against the IRS over alleged ""unlawful disclosures"" made by the pair of whistleblowers who accused government prosecutors of mishandling their investigation into him. Hunter Biden's attorney files court papers seeking to have his client's arraignment, scheduled for Oct. 3 in a Delaware court, take place via video conference instead of in person. A judge denies Hunter Biden's effort to avoid appearing in person at his arraignment on federal gun charges, ordering him to appear at a hearing scheduled for Oct. 3. The same day, Attorney General Merrick Garland, testifying for five hours before the House Judiciary Committee, is grilled by GOP lawmakers about his department's handling of criminal probes into Hunter Biden and others. Garland pushes back on GOP claims that he's taken any directives from the White House, saying, ""I am not the president's lawyer. I am not Congress' prosecutor. The Justice Department works for the American people. Our job is to follow the facts and the law, and that is what we do."" Hunter Biden files a lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, accusing the former Trump attorney of computer fraud over his role in obtaining and sharing the alleged contents of the infamous laptop. In a statement responding to the suit, Giuliani adviser Ted Goodman says, ""I'm not surprised he's now falsely claiming his laptop hard drive was manipulated by Mayor Giuliani, considering the sordid material and potential evidence of crimes on that thing."" Hunter Biden, appearing in the same Delaware courthouse where his federal plea deal with prosecutors fell apart over the summer, formally enters a plea of not guilty to the three felony gun charges that were part of the original plea agreement. ABC News reports that Hunter Biden is urging the Justice Department to investigate his former business associate Tony Bobulinski over claims that Bobulinski lied to federal investigators during an interview in the weeks leading up to the 2020 presidential election when he alleged that the Bidens had lied to the public about the nature of then-candidate Joe Biden's involvement in Hunter Biden's proposed overseas business ventures. Hunter Biden is subpoenaed by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer to appear before the committee, along with his former business associate Rob Walker, President Biden's brother James Biden, and other members of the Biden family. Hunter Biden's attorneys file a motion seeking court approval to issue subpoenas to former President Donald Trump, former Attorney General William Barr, and two ex-Justice Department officials for documents they say could shed light on whether the federal gun charges Hunter Biden is facing were the result of ""a vindictive or selective prosecution arising from an unrelenting pressure campaign beginning in the last administration."" ABC News reports that special counsel David Weiss is using a Los Angeles-based federal grand jury to pursue the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs, according to sources. The grand jury has issued a subpoena to James Biden, the brother of President Joe Biden, as part of the probe, a source says. Responding to his subpoena to appear before the House Oversight Committee, Hunter Biden, in a letter from his attorney to Republican lawmakers, says he is willing to testify before the panel -- but only in a public forum. Special counsel David Weiss files nine tax-related charges against Hunter Biden, accusing him of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes from 2016 to 2020. The indictment alleges that the younger Biden earned millions of dollars from foreign entities and ""spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle at the same time he chose not to pay his taxes."" Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, claims the 56-page indictment includes ""no new evidence"" and says, ""Based on the facts and the law, if Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought."" Attorneys representing Hunter Biden ask a federal judge to dismiss three felony gun charges he faces in Delaware. The president's son pleaded not guilty to all three charges in October, after Weiss indicted him on the charges in September. As GOP lawmakers convene to depose Hunter Biden in a closed-door session that he has informed them he won't attend, he addresses members of the media outside the U.S. Capitol and slams House Republicans for refusing to allow him to answer questions in a public forum, saying, ""I am here to testify at a public hearing today, to answer any of the committees' legitimate questions."" Hunter Biden makes a surprise appearance at a hearing of the GOP-led House Oversight Committee on whether to hold him in contempt of Congress for refusing a subpoena to testify before the committee behind closed doors. The committee approves a resolution recommending he be held in contempt for his refusal of provide closed-door testimony. Hunter Biden, appearing in federal court in Los Angeles, enters a plea of not guilty to the nine felony and misdemeanor tax charges in special counsel David Weiss' December indictment. Special counsel David Weiss' office issues a biting rebuttal to Hunter Biden's attempt to have the three felony gun charges against him thrown out, calling his selective prosecution claim ""a fiction designed for a Hollywood script."" The filing comes on the same day that the Justice Department files a motion seeking to dismiss a civil lawsuit filed by Hunter Biden against the Internal Revenue Service over its alleged failure to protect his tax information from disclosure by the two whistleblowers who accused the Biden administration of mishandling the probe into the president's son. Hunter Biden, after weeks of back-and-forth with the House Oversight and Judiciary committees, agrees to sit for a closed-door deposition on Feb. 28, avoiding the threat of contempt of Congress charges. A longtime business partner of Hunter Biden, Eric Schwerin, tells the House Oversight Committee in a closed-door interview that he is ""not aware of any financial transactions or compensation"" that then-Vice President Joe Biden received related to business conducted by this family members. Tony Bobulinski, the onetime business associate of Hunter Biden who has become a critic of the Biden family, testifies before the House Oversight Committee, reiterating claims he made during the 2020 election that Joe Biden was ""an enabler"" of several of his family's overseas business schemes that ""sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to Joe Biden and the United States government."" Special counsel David Weiss indicts Alexander Smirnov, an FBI confidential source who provided derogatory information about President Biden and his son Hunter Biden, on felony false statement and obstruction charges. Smirnov is the same person that Republicans have called ""a highly credible FBI source"" and have used to claim Joe Biden is corrupt, multiple senior congressional sources tell ABC News. Attorneys for Hunter Biden move to dismiss the tax-related charges brought by special counsel David Weiss in California, accusing prosecutors of selectively targeting the younger Biden, violating a statute of limitations, and filing duplicative charges on three counts of failure to pay and tax evasion. In a court filing, special counsel David Weiss says that one-time FBI informant Alexander Smirnov had high-level Russian contacts and that, following his arrest the week before, Smirnov told the FBI that ""officials with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story"" about Hunter Biden. A measured and defiant Hunter Biden addresses a litany of allegations during six hours of closed-door testimony before the GOP-led House Oversight and Judiciary committees. The deposition appears to include no major bombshells as he repeatedly invokes his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction -- telling the committee he is ""embarrassed"" by some of his conduct at the time -- while vehemently and repeatedly denying that his father had any involvement in his business life. A week after Hunter Biden's closed-door testimony on Capitol Hill, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer invites him to appear for a public hearing on March 20. Special counsel David Weiss files his rebuttal to efforts by Hunter Biden to have his nine tax-related charges in California dismissed, slamming his arguments in court filings as a ""conspiracy theory,"" a ""house of cards,"" and ""shapeshifting claims."" A week after his closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee as part of their impeachment inquiry, Hunter Biden, through his attorney, declines an invitation by congressional Republicans to testify in public -- but suggests he would attend a hearing on foreign influence peddling if lawmakers also invited members of former President Donald Trump's family. The development comes on the same day that the judge overseeing Hunter Biden's felony gun case in Delaware tentatively schedules his trial for June 3 -- just weeks before his Los Angeles-based tax trial is scheduled to begin on June 20. Judge Mark Scarsi, the federal judge overseeing Hunter Biden's tax case in California, hears several defense motions to dismiss the charges and says afterward that he will issue a ruling by April 17. Judge Scarsi denies all eight of Hunter Biden's motions to dismiss his nine-count tax indictment in California, paving the way for a June 20 trial. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika denies attempts by Hunter Biden to dismiss the three federal gun charges he faces, all but ensuring he will stand trial in June. Attorneys representing Hunter Biden threaten to sue Fox News for violating ""revenge porn"" laws and publishing since-discredited bribery allegations as part of a scheme to ""paint him in a false light,"" according to a letter obtained by ABC News. Special counsel David Weiss' office suggests in court papers that they will call multiple women who had relationships with Hunter Biden to testify in his upcoming felony gun trial, including his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and the widow of his late brother Beau Biden, Hallie Biden. Prosecutors say in a court filing that they plan to use Hunter Biden's infamous laptop as evidence in his upcoming felony gun trial to help them prove that he unlawfully obtained a firearm in 2018. The development comes on the same day that U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi grants Hunter Biden's request to postpone his Los Angeles trial on tax charges until Sept. 5 -- raising the likelihood that a jury could be deliberating whether to convict the president's son on several felony counts in the waning weeks of the 2024 election. A jury of six woman and six men is sworn in on Day 1 of Hunter Biden's federal gun trial in Delaware, where the president's son is accused of lying on an ATF form when he said he was not using drugs at the time of his gun purchase in 2018. Prosecutors enter Hunter Biden's infamous laptop as evidence on Day 2 of the trial, with an FBI special agent testifying that investigators were able confirm the laptop was his by matching its serial number to his iCloud account. Prosecutors cite messages found on the laptop to argue that Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs at the time of his 2018 gun purchase, and also play audiobook excerpts from his 2021 memoir in which he discusses his past drug use. But the FBI witness acknowledges under cross-examination that she cannot verify that his drug use was continuous during that period. Prosecution witnesses Kathleen Buhle and Zoe Kestan, Hunter Biden's ex-wife and ex-girlfriend, testify on Day 3 of the trial about Hunter Biden's drug use to bolster the government's argument that he was using drugs at the time he purchased the gun in Delaware in October 2018. Kestan, however, concedes on cross-examination that she had ""no idea"" what Hunter Biden was up to from Sept. 23, when he left California for Delaware, until November, when the two reconnected. Hallie Biden, the widow of President Joe Biden's late son Beau Biden who was romantically involved with Hunter Biden at the time he purchased the gun at the center of the case, testifies on Day 4 of the trial about how she discovered the firearm in Hunter Biden's vehicle on Oct. 23, 2018, and, in a panic, disposed of it in a trash receptacle outside a local supermarket. She tells jurors that she also found ""remnants"" of crack in Hunter Biden's vehicle at the time she discovered the gun -- but acknowledges under cross-examination that she did not see Hunter Biden abusing drugs or alcohol for most of the month of October, potentially undercutting the prosecution's contention that he was using drugs at the time he purchased the gun on Oct. 12. After the government rests it case, Hunter Biden's daughter Naomi Biden, testifying for the defense, tells jurors on Day 5 of the trial that her dad ""seemed great"" just days after he purchased the Colt revolver at the center of the case -- but her testimony under cross-examination suggests that drug remnants found in his truck by his then-girlfriend Hallie Biden 11 days after the gun purchase likely came from him. The defense rests its case without Hunter Biden taking the stand on Day 6 of the trial. Prosecutors tell the jury in closing arguments that Hunter Biden ""knew he was using drugs"" when he said otherwise on the gun-purchase form, while the defense argues that prosecutors failed to ""fill in the gaps"" about Hunter Biden's drug use around the time of the gun purchase ""because they don't have the proof."" Hunter Biden is found guilty on all three counts in his federal gun case: two counts of making false statements for saying on a federal form that he was not addicted to drugs at the time he purchased the firearm at the center of the case, and a third count of illegally obtaining the firearm while addicted to drugs. President Joe Biden says he will accept the outcome of his son's case and that he will ""continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal."" President Biden tells reporters that he would not commute any sentence handed down to his son Hunter Biden following the younger Biden's federal gun conviction. Attorneys for Hunter Biden request a new trial in his federal gun case, arguing that his ""convictions should be vacated"" because the trial commenced before a circuit court formally issued a mandate denying his appeal. Hunter Biden sues Fox News and its parent company over their production of the fictional miniseries ""The Trial of Hunter Biden,"" which his attorneys call ""an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation."" Attorneys for Hunter Biden withdraw their bid for a new trial in his federal gun case, conceding in court papers that a motion they filed last month misunderstood a technicality in the district court's capacity to carry out a trial. Attorneys for Hunter Biden, citing a decision by a federal judge in Florida to dismiss the classified documents case against Donald Trump, file a pair of motions in California and Delaware seeking to dismiss both federal criminal cases against him. Hunter Biden drops his lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company over the fictional miniseries ""The Trial of Hunter Biden,"" with the intention of refiling it against new defendants. In a court filing in Hunter Biden's federal tax case, special counsel David Weiss accuses him of accepting payments from a Romanian businessman who was attempting to ""influence U.S. government agencies,"" while his father Joe Biden was vice president. Hunter Biden's attorneys call the claim an ""inflammatory and incomplete, and therefore misleading, characterization."" Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell confirms reports that Hunter Biden, while his father was vice president in 2016, attempted to enlist the support of the U.S. ambassador to Italy for a prospective business deal in what Lowell says was a ""normal and proper practice."" The judge overseeing Hunter Biden's federal tax case rejects Hunter Biden's latest attempt to dismiss several of the charges against him, all but ensuring that the case will go to trial in September as scheduled. The judge overseeing the case of the former FBI informant charged with lying about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden's overseas business ties rejects an effort to challenge the legitimacy of special counsel David Weiss' appointment on the same grounds that a federal judge dismissed Donald Trump's classified documents case.","""Is Hunter Biden's sentencing on gun charges postponed until after the presidential election?""",True,False,True

"Secret Service should have watched roof used by Trump rally shooter, acting director says","Secret Service under pressure over security lapses at Trump rally  The US Secret Service has one primary job - to protect current and former US presidents – and in that they failed spectacularly when an attempt was made on Donald Trump’s life on Saturday. It has been 43 years since the last assassination attempt on a former or present US president, when Ronald Reagan was shot in the lung but survived. Today, American politicians and the public want to know how a would-be assassin was able to crawl onto a rooftop vantage point, armed with a rifle, and let off four shots towards the podium - all in an area that was supposed to have been cleared. Why were warnings from the public apparently ignored or not acted upon? And why, when a highly charged presidential election is just four months away, did the Secret Service not do a better job of protecting the man many believe will be America’s next president? The investigation that is already under way involves the FBI as well as the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security. The Secret Service director, Kimberly Cheatle, has been summoned to testify before a committee of the US House of Representatives on 22 July. Those who attended the rally itself were asked to pass through metal detectors to ensure they were not bringing any weapons, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. But the gunman believed to have fired the shots could clearly be seen crawling around with a rifle on top of a nearby building for several minutes, one eyewitness told the BBC. The witness, who called himself Greg, said warnings that he and others gave were not acted upon by police, who he suggested did not know “what was going on” and had poor visibility of the rooftop. The suspected gunman - who has been named by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks - also appears to have been caught on camera lining up his shot, in footage obtained by TMZ. One spectator was killed and two others critically injured before the gunman was himself shot dead. Trump was also injured in the ear. State police have said it is “too early” to determine exactly what happened. Trump’s life might have been saved by the fact he ducked after the first shots were fired, said David Dunn, a professor of international politics from the University of Birmingham. In that respect, he “clearly had been well trained by the Secret Service”, Prof Dunn told BBC Radio 5 Live. Before being whisked away in a car by agents, Trump rose again to pump his fist before the crowd. Greg said he was left wondering why agents were not deployed on all the nearby rooftops, and did not intervene to take Trump off stage after he raised the alarm. Former Secret Service agent Charles Marino agreed that there were questions to answer. He told the BBC it would have been among the agents’ tasks to survey the surroundings and note “concerning areas”. Experts who spoke to NBC said events such as political rallies always brought challenges in securing a wide expanse of land. One of them, former Secret Service agent Evy Poumpouras, said there would always be lingering questions: “How do you secure that outer perimeter? How far do you go? And can you cover everything? That’s a problem.” Analysis from BBC Verify suggests that Crooks was able to get a little more than 130m (430ft) from Trump’s position behind the lectern. It was announced late on Saturday that the FBI had assumed the role of lead investigator into the incident, which it describes as an assassination attempt. One of its special agents said at a news conference it was “surprising” that the gunman had been able to open fire before the Secret Service killed him. But when asked if there was a failure of security, he said his team was ""not gonna make that assessment"" while the investigation continued. The Secret Service was not represented at the briefing. An earlier statement confirming the start of the investigation promised more information would be released when available. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said maintaining the security of presidential candidates was one of the departments “most vital priorities”. It is not clear what the attack will mean for the former president's future security arrangements, though an adviser to the Trump campaign said it was clear he needed more protection. A Secret Service spokesman has denied an ""untrue assertion"" that it was asked by Trump's team for extra resources, but rebuffed this request. In any case, Trump was now likely to receive a security detail comparable to that of a sitting president, former Secret Service agent Joseph LaSorsa told the Reuters news agency. “There will be an intensive review… there's going to be a massive realignment,"" he said. ""This cannot happen."" The Republican National Convention will go ahead as planned on Monday, with a speech from Trump on Thursday, as confirmed by a statement from the party. During the event, Trump will be officially nominated as the Republican candidate for president ahead of November’s election. The Channel Island's attorney general says the money will be given back to Thailand. Local schools were asked to monitor the 14-year-old after online threats about a school shooting in 2023, the FBI says. Colt Gray arrested after deaths of two pupils and two teachers at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia.

"Kamala Harris has earned enough votes to win the Democratic presidential nomination, party chair announces","How did Kamala Harris wrap up the Democratic nomination in 32 hours?  COMMENTARY  September 3, 2024     It was a remarkable display of unity for a political party famous for its tendency to form a circular firing squad. In between 2:00 PM EST on July 21, when it became known that President Joe Biden would not run again, and 9:48 PM EST on July 22, when the Associated Press announced that Vice President Kamala Harris had the support of enough convention delegates to win the nomination—the oldest political party in the world replaced the nominee chosen in the primaries. How did that happen? The story unfolds on two levels. During the approximately three weeks between President Biden’s fatal debate and his decision to drop out of the race, the Biden campaign attempted a reset. In a much-anticipated press conference following the NATO Summit in Washington, Biden failed to erase the impression that he was simply too old for the job even though he spoke intelligently about complex foreign policy issues. During this period, people familiar with the Democratic Party rules pointed out that Rule 13J of the delegate selection rules contained a loophole that would allow convention delegates to vote for whoever they wanted to vote for; just because Biden had won the vast majority of delegates didn’t mean the delegates were stuck with him. And during this period, congressional leaders, worried about how the collapse of support for Biden would affect their own candidates, engaged in nonstop, intense conversations about how to get Biden out of the race. On July 2, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), dean of the black congressional delegation, announced that he would support Harris if Biden stepped aside. It was a not-so-subtle warning to anyone thinking of challenging Harris that Black elected officials would not take kindly to challenges to a Black Vice President from white elected officials, but it also acknowledged the reality that Biden should consider stepping aside. On July 10, Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) was the first United States Senator to call for Biden to drop out. He did it in an article in the Washington Post, which was respectful of the President but also argued out loud what almost everyone else was thinking—for the good of the country, Biden had to go. On that same day, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi gave an interview on MSNBC where she said “It’s up to Biden to decide if he’s going to run. Whatever he decides we go with.” Following firm statements from the White House that Biden would in fact run, this was widely interpreted as Pelosi saying Biden should not run. During those three weeks, pundits came up with ways to hold a “mini primary” or some process by which the party could replace Biden. While interesting and creative, these plans all had the same flaws; the party already had a process for replacing Biden—it was called the Democratic National Convention. There was simply no time to organize any pre-convention activities, and no one else seemed interested in running for the Democratic nomination. And so…on to the untold portion of the story. By the time of Biden’s debate fiasco, all 50 states plus territories had finished electing their delegates to the convention. The delegates had all been elected, either in open meetings in their congressional districts, at a state convention, or, in some states, on the ballot. They too had been having the same conversations as every other Democrat in the country—should Biden run, and if not, who should? The views of these 3,770 pledged delegates were largely ignored by the press even though they vastly outnumbered the 749 automatic delegates (representatives, senators, governors, DNC members, etc.) who were getting the most attention. The press was so focused on the congressional party that no one tried polling the very group that would control the decision. In all but 11 states, the state delegation chair was the chair of the Democratic Party. The state chairs are a close bunch, organized under the rubric of the Association of State Democratic Parties (ASDC) and headed by the Minnesota State Chair, Ken Martin. According to Martin, during the three weeks between the debate and Biden’s decision, the state party chairs, like their congressional counterparts, stuck by Biden publicly but they kept their ears to the ground and picked up the fact that “folks were getting restless.” On Friday, July 19, Martin pulled together a virtual meeting of the ASDC’s Executive committee, consisting of about 50 state chairs, vice chairs, and executive directors. This group, unlike those floating alternative systems, are the people who actually put together the nomination system. They send out the notices, set the filing deadlines, choose the school gyms and union halls where meetings will be held, adjudicate the disputes, and do the million other tasks needed to constitute a democratically elected convention. They knew better than most that it was simply too late to run a mini primary. They agreed that if Biden didn’t run, they would reconvene the entire ASDC and whip their delegates to endorse Harris. As Martin put it, “There was no time for a family food fight.” On the night of July 21, hours after Biden’s decision to drop out became public, Martin called a virtual meeting of all 180 state chairs, vice chairs, and executive directors where they decided to poll their delegations with the expectation that Harris would receive all the support. At 4:00 PM Central Time, Tennessee became the first state to pledge delegates to Harris. Seventy delegates joined a Zoom call and voted unanimously to endorse Harris. While two delegates did not attend the call (former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Steve Cohen), they had already publicly expressed their support for the vice president. Metro Nashville School Board member and delegate Freda Player spoke in favor of Harris. Later that evening, South Carolina became the second state to pledge its 55 delegates to Harris. That same evening, North Carolina’s 116 delegates joined a virtual “emergency meeting” led by Anderson Clayton, the chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party and unanimously endorsed Harris, thus becoming the third state to pledge delegates to Harris. Delegates also expressed support for Gov. Roy Cooper as the vice-presidential nominee. By the end of the night, New Hampshire, Florida, Louisiana, Guam, and Alaska had also endorsed Harris. By the end of the next day, July 22, 25 states had endorsed Harris, and the Associated Press announced that she had enough votes to secure the nomination on a first ballot. By 9:00 PM on July 24, the elected officials followed and 100% of the Democratic governors, 96% of Democratic senators, and 94% of Democratic representatives endorsed Harris. Why was the consensus around Harris so fast? Certainly, lack of time played a role, as did the absence of any serious challenger. But one other factor was at play. As I know from personal experience, having worked for Vice President Al Gore, vice presidents have a heck of a time getting press coverage. They do the hard and unglamorous work for their president and their party, attending the state party conventions and the Jefferson-Jackson Day dinners and speaking to reporters in secondary or tertiary markets. But the party activists who regularly turn out for their events are the same people who run for delegate slots at the convention and get out the vote in elections. For much of the public, Kamala Harris was the 2020 candidate who dropped out before the first primary, but for many of the people in Ken Martin’s world, she was a more mature candidate and a familiar and welcome presence. That is how Harris achieved a modern political miracle. RELATED CONTENT Linda Peek Schacht August 29, 2024 Elaine Kamarck, William A.

Trump’s political operation says it raised nearly $139 million in July,"Trump’s latest 2024 campaign fundraising report shows him lagging behind Biden in cash   FILE - Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally, March 9, 2024, in Rome Ga. An attorney for Donald Trump says he’s optimistic an appellate review will lead to the Georgia 2020 election interference case against him being dismissed and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis being disqualified. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s fundraising picked up last month, but his political operation is still struggling to catch up to President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party in money coming in. Trump’s campaign and his Save America political action committee, two key committees in his political operation, reported raising a combined $15.9 million in February and ended the month with more than $37 million on hand, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission Wednesday night. That’s up from January, when the committees raised only $13.8 million. As Trump in February handily won primary contests in Nevada and New Hampshire, the prospects of any Republican challenger overtaking him in the presidential race dimmed significantly. “Americans know that they were better off with President Trump four years ago than with Crooked Joe Biden and his disastrous policies. We need a return to America First policies that successfully kept our country safe and supercharged the economy for all Americans,” Trump’s campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a statement. Unimpressed, Biden campaign Communications Director Michael Tyler said in a statement, “If Donald Trump put up these kinds of numbers on The Apprentice, he’d fire himself,.” “But here’s why he ain’t got it: his extreme, toxic agenda of banning abortion, slashing Social Security, and promoting political violence is repelling donors and doing exactly (asterisk)nothing(asterisk) to earn support from the voters who will decide this election.”  Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, said his political operation raised $53 million last month and ended February with $155 million on hand. That includes Biden’s joint fundraising with the Democratic National Committee. The full picture will not be available until April when some of the committees in his political operation are due to file reports. His main campaign account raised $21 million in February, according to its latest filing with the FEC, and ended the month with $71 million on hand. The monthly numbers reported by the two Trump committees are key to his fundraising operation but only a portion of the full picture, with other committees scheduled to report their latest numbers in April. The Save America committee has been paying the bulk of Trump’s legal fees in his various court cases. Legal spending made up 85% of its total operating expenses during the first two months of this year, roughly the same as 2023, when such expenses were about 89%. It has spent $8.5 million on legal fees so far this year. Trump’s February numbers did not include any fundraising with the Republican National Committee. Earlier this month, days after his last major opponent Nikki Haley dropped out of the GOP primary, Trump’s political team took over the cash-strapped RNC and installed a new leadership team. The campaign this week set up joint fundraising operations with the RNC. Kessler reported from Washington. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

"Tears, hugs and a salute as three freed Americans back on US soil after historic prisoner swap with Russia","Americans released in Russian prisoner swap are back in the U.S.  By  Ayana Archie 1 OF 4 Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva landed in the U.S. late Thursday after being included in a historic prisoner swap with Russia.  Whelan exited the plane first at Joint Base Andrew in Maryland, followed by Gershkovich then Kurmasheva, who works for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe. The trio exchanged handshakes and hugs with President Biden and Vice President Harris, and embraced their family members as onlookers cheered. ""My job is to make sure, number one, they don't get there, and if they do, we get them back,"" Biden told reporters at the base as the released prisoners were mingled with family and greeted friends looking on. ""I don't buy this idea that you're going to let these people rot in jail because other people may be captured."" They were among more than a dozen prisoners released by Russia in exchange for Russian prisoners held by the United States and countries throughout Europe, U.S. officials said Thursday. In all, 16 political prisoners, journalists and others, including five Germans, were exchanged for eight Russians jailed in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Slovenia and Poland. Among the Russians is Vadim Krasikov, a convicted Russian state assassin in German custody, as well as three other Russians in U.S. custody. ""The toughest call on this one was for other countries,"" Biden said. ""I asked them to do some things that were against their immediate self interests, and really very difficult for them to do, particularly Germany and Slovenia."" Vice President Harris said, ""This is just an extraordinary testament to the importance of having a president who understands the power of diplomacy, and understands the strength that rests in understanding the significance of diplomacy and strengthening alliances. This is an incredible day."" The prisoner exchange was one of the largest between the United States, its allies and Russia since the end of the Cold War. “Not since the Cold War has there been a similar number of individuals exchanged in this way,” said U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan, adding the exchange was the “culmination of many rounds of complex painstaking negotiations over many, many months.” Earlier, Biden said the deal was “a feat of diplomacy” and thanked allies who worked with the United States on it. “This is a powerful example of why it’s vital to have friends in this world whom you can trust and depend on,” he said in a statement. Sullivan said Biden would seek to build on the success to try to free Marc Fogel, a U.S. citizen still held in Russia, and other Americans held in Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Gershkovich was arrested in Moscow in March 2023 and became the first U.S. journalist since the Cold War to be charged with espionage. Last month, a Russian court sentenced him to 16 years in prison, after he was accused by the Russian prosecutor of working with the CIA to collect information on a Russian arms company. Gershkovich, his employer and the U.S. government strenuously denied the allegations, and the U.S. considered Gershkovich wrongfully detained. Whelan, a Marine Corps veteran who holds U.S., British, Irish and Canadian citizenship, was arrested in Russia in December 2018 on charges of espionage he strongly denied. A Moscow court sentenced him to 16 years in prison in June 2020. Whelan’s case began receiving widespread attention as part of a failed proposal by the U.S. to bring him home, along with WNBA player Brittney Griner, who served 293 days in a Russian penal colony for having cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner returned to the U.S. in December 2022, but continued to advocate for Whelan’s release. “We are overwhelmed with joy and relief for the four U.S. citizens who returned safely to America today,” Griner and her wife, Cherelle, said in a statement. “The Biden-Harris Adminstration showed true leadership once again by doing whatever it took to bring Americans home. Every American returned is a win.” The three freed prisoners later landed in San Antonio, Texas, where they are to be transported to Brooke Army Medical Center for Post Isolation Support Activities, a U.S government official said. Several family members and State Department personnel accompanied them on the flight. NPR’s Rob Schmitz, Nick Spicer and Michele Keleman contributed to this report.

In addition, the new state government is considering removing former Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s photographs from the land boundary marker stones, which were fixed during land surveys during the previous tenure. Also, the new government is considering removing Reddy's photo from lakhs of land ownership passbooks issued under the Land Titling Act. Chandrababu Naidu, speaking this week in the Assembly, mentioned that his government would reissue the pattadar passbooks with only the official state seal. “The Jagan government wasted ₹15 crore for printing his photos on the passbooks. The state government, as promised during the electioneering and as per the demand of the people, has decided to issue passbooks with the official seal. Officers have already submitted a copy of the passbook carrying the official seal,” IE quoted CM Naidu as saying.

"Mamata, movies, politics: How Bengal CM again displayed her hold over Tollywood","Has politics hijacked Kolkata people's protest?  Listen to Story It's been 18 days since the rape-murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, and the protests show no signs of subsiding. It was a natural outpouring of angst and anger which found an immediate trigger in the RG Kar case. People concerned over their safety and fearing that the accused would be shielded, flooded the streets. Much has changed since then. The protests began a fortnight ago. Since then, Kolkata has seen regular protests. Are the protesters common people who are just demanding justice, and who exactly are they protesting against? Have the protests in recent days been hijacked by political parties? The question is of the utmost importance as a newly formed, unregistered students' body -- Paschimbanga Chhatra Samaj -- marches towards Nabanna, the West Bengal secretariat, demanding Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's resignation.  While the protesting people sought justice for the trainee doctor and a better law and order situation in the state, there was no call for Mamata Banerjee's ouster by them. This is a new demand, which also shows that the protest has taken a political turn. Some of the people who have been protesting for justice told IndiaToday.In, that political parties have played a role in providing momentum to the organic protests. They also said that as days progressed, the opposition parties, like the BJP and the CPI(M), have positioned themselves at the forefront of the protests. Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress has claimed the protests to be political.  ""There's an organised campaign being run by BJP by trending 'Mamata Must Resign'. Genuine protestors have now been replaced by BJYM & BJP workers on the streets of Kolkata. In their own words: the ONLY agenda is toppling the Govt,"" TMC MP Saket Gokhale said. There's ""a sinister toolkit"" was at play, the Rajya Sabha MP alleged.   This isn't completely true. However, it would also be incorrect to rule out a role of the Opposition in the recent agitation in West Bengal. To assess the validity of the TMC's claims and for a nuanced understanding of the Kolkata protests, IndiaToday.In spoke to various Kolkata-based people involved in the protests, including a Tollywood actor, an internet celebrity, an academic, and a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha leader. The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) is the youth wing of the BJP.  ""People of Bengal are protesting, demanding quick and fair justice for the RG Kar rape victim. But the protest is not about just one incident. Probably, the long-due anger in people is coming out. And this is the outburst that you are seeing,"" popular content creator and author Indrajit Lahiri tells IndiaToday.In. Tollywood actor Anuradha Mukherjee has beren protesting vigorously since August 14, when women poured out to 'Reclaim the Night'. ""As a working woman I was affected by the RG Kar incident. It was not a call by any organisation or any party, it was my call that I have to join as a citizen of the city,"" Anuradha Mukherjee tells IndiaToday.In. ""Even when I have to shoot at night, there's always uncertainty. You never know what might happen to anyone,"" she adds, revealing the fear of working women in Bengal. What is interesting is that the protesters earlier had been demanding speedy justice in the RG Kar case and women's safety in the state. ""I had never witnessed an incident like this before, and perhaps that's why thousands took to the streets in protest,"" Mukherjee says, pointing to how the protests were organic in the initial days. ""The protest is undoubtedly organic because it has brought together school and college students, university students, the general public, and even people from Tollywood. This level of participation can't happen unless it comes from a deep sense of conviction,"" she adds. Bengal BJYM Vice President Aroon Shah too says the protests have been organic, citing the participation of people from across professions and strata in them. ""Men and women from all walks of life took to the streets across West Bengal. In fact, the state administration is busy sending show cause letters to school principals who have allowed their students and teachers to take out protests seeking justice for ‘Abhaya’,"" Shah tells IndiaToday.In. ""East Bengal and Mohun Bagan supporters who are arch rivals on the field came together and protested against this incident. The police lathicharged them but the protests continued. Such a display of unity among the people remains unseen heretofore,"" says Shah.  None of the protesters have any doubt about the role of political parties or the mileage they have tried to gain from the popular anger against the Mamata Banerjee government. ""It's inevitable that in such a large movement, there will be some political involvement. We can't deny that,"" says actor Mukherjee. ""When a movement rises against a government, political parties are bound to play a role, whether positive or negative — that only time will tell. There's definitely a political side to it."" Garga Chatterjee, a faculty member at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, and general secretary of pro-Bengali advocacy group Bangla Pokkho, makes it clear that several political parties and civil society organisations are playing a key role in the protests now. ""The protests have been both organic and organised. Some of it is organic, and it peaked on the night of August 14. Since then, the proportion of protests tied to political parties has been increasing and the organic proportion has been decreasing,"" Chatterjee tells IndiaToday.In. People have realised this and tried to keep their movement apolitical as far as possible. ""Political parties probably have tried joining. But this time, common people are trying to stop them from doing so. This is purely a people’s movement,"" says influencer Indrajit Lahiri, aka Foodka.  An example would be how the West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front, an outfit of medicos from across West Bengal, stayed clear of Tuesday's 'Nabanna March'. Instead, the doctors are planning a massive rally from Shyambazar to Dharmatala in central Kolkata, on Wednesday. People participating in the rallies have their doubts about the newly floated Paschimbanga Chhatra Samaj being apolitical. ""The protests are almost fully hijacked by political parties or quasi-political organisations as of 26 August,"" Garga Chatterjee tells IndiaToday.In. He cites three telltale signs to prove his point. ""The CPM and the BJP are trying to push the protests towards Mamata Banerjee's resignation. Left groups are trying to call for systemic changes to ensure women's rights and security. Bengali nationalist organisations, like Bangla Pokkho, are trying to push a 'Bengali victim vs Bihari perpetrator' narrative, and pointing to an ethnic pattern in many such recent incidents in West Bengal,"" says Chatterjee. Another South Kolkata resident who didn't want to be named quantified the people-political participation in the protests. ""If the people to political ratio was 70:30 in the beginning, it has reversed to 30:70 now,"" he told IndiaToday, explaining the diminishing participation of people in the protests now.  Following the rape and murder of the trainee doctor, protests erupted at the RG Kar hospital, organised by doctors, after irregularities were found in the response of the college and administration's response. Soon medicos and women's right bodies across West Bengal joined in amplifying the voice of justice. As the protests spread to other cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, a diverse range of voices and people joined the cause. Last week, members of the LGBTQ+ community in Kolkata joined hands to protest over the rape and murder at RG Kar. Days back, a massive group of some 300 drivers from app-based cab services in Kolkata held a rally against the incident. Social media influencers also played a crucial role in amplifying the protests. Protestors from various walks of life organised candle marches, rallies, and sit-ins. However, with each passing day, it might have been difficult to sustain an organic person's movement as the initial shock subsided, and people got busy with their daily lives. Also, there is a growing frustration with the hardship these protests are brining to daily commuters with Kolkata's narrow roads being jammed. ""It's been from August 9 to 27, and still, how much longer? When will our legal system address these issues swiftly? Why is it taking so long? Why can't it be resolved? We are peacefully marching, but for how much longer? How long will we have to wait? I put this question to the government, to the Supreme Court, to everyone,"" says actor Anuradha Mukherjee, expressing the popular frustration over the ""slow probe"". Indrahit Lahiri says the ""single-point demand"" of the people is a solution to the state's law and order situation and the guilty in the RG Kar case to be punished. Mamata Banerjee looks electorally safe for now with the Assembly election far off in 2026. ""This case would have had a big impact closer to the elections,"" says the South Kolkata-based resident, who chose anonymity. With Durga Puja, celebrated with great fanfare in West Bengal, weeks away, whatever remains of the organic protests might fizzle out. ""It is very hard to say where the protests are headed but the absence of an election in the near future as well as Durga Pujo are factors against the long-term sustainability of the present fervour,"" says Garga Chatterjee. Though the protests have taken a different hue and turn now, it must be clear to Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress that people of West Bengal are not going to be mute spectators when it comes to law-and-order issues of the state or justice for women. The initial protests have also revealed how popular anger can spill over to the streets and an authoritarian administration can be pushed on the back foot.","""What are the recent political actions of Mamata Banerjee in Tollywood that demonstrate her influence?""",True,False,True

"Dalit leader who fought for SC sub-classification: ‘Verdict will benefit a hundred generations of Madigas, other downtrodden castes’","Opposition to Sub-classification — Negation of Reality, Equality and Unity   The August 1 judgement by the seven-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court upholding the constitutional validity of the sub-classification of the Scheduled Castes reservations was historic and should have set aside all the legal and constitutional apprehensions about the issue. But the unsolicited “opinions” of some of the judges on the bench about introducing the “creamy layer” condition to the SC reservations predominated the response resulting in overwhelming negative reaction about the main aspect of the judgement — the need and power of the state assemblies to further sub-classify the castes within the SCs to facilitate more marginalised within the category to get their share of the diminishing cake. The confusion among the semi-informed was compounded further by the reluctance of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main Opposition Congress  in welcoming the judgement. On the other hand, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and the Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)) of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) of the INDIA bloc openly opposed the judgement.  All these confusions, apprehensions, genuine concerns, and prejudices against the sub-classification of SC reservations manifested in the nationwide protest against the judgement on August 21. Although it did not have any reverberations in South India, it made an impact in North India. While opportunist political parties from both spectrums extended support to the bandh, notwithstanding their earlier commitment to sub-classification, there were some genuine voices expressing concerns about the possible polarisation it could cause, resulting in the breaking of Dalit unity, which the BJP has been trying to induce for a long time. Even Chandrashekhar Ravan, the young MP from Uttar Pradesh who has emerged as a ray of hope for Dalits, has announced that he will intensify the anti-sub-classification movement from September 11 and defeat the designs of the governments to divide Dalits.  Moreover, some of the country’s leading progressive scholars, who are concerned about the oppressed, are also raising serious questions and apprehensions. Their concerns stem from the fact that the current neoliberal economic context is rendering reservations irrelevant. Furthermore, there is a limit to reservations as a tool of social justice. While intended to ensure ‘adequate representation’ in state services, reservations have an inherent limitation — they only achieve the upliftment of a small stratum within the community, rather than the overall progress of the community. In such a situation, when the oppressed need to fight for their existence and identities with even greater unity, these pro-Dalit intellectuals wonder if sub-classification creates a cleavage between Dalits and assists Brahminical and capitalist forces. Although these cautious concerns cannot be dismissed, some opinions from these quarters are also fraught with incorrect diagnoses, and therefore, wrong prognoses. The questions – misconceptions emanating against the subclassification broadly fall into the following categories:  While acknowledging the caution and concern that these questions raise, let’s take a look at some historical and political issues that these questions have failed to consider. Scheduled Castes — Homogenous externally, heterogenous internally The root of all the above questions depends on how well we understand the breadth and depth of the Brahminical caste system in this country. Caste cannot exist without the hierarchy of superior and inferior. Thus, B.R. Ambedkar described it also as “graded inequality”. And explained it as “a ladder-less multi-storied structure wherein those above never come down, those below can never climb up”. Is there no such stratification among the castes clubbed together as Scheduled Castes?  Untouchability is generally considered a prime criterion for being classified as a Scheduled Caste and untouchability itself is perceived as homogenous in its social operation.  In 2004, a five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court, which denied internal reservation in the E.V. Chinnaiah case, also put forward the same argument. But the seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court, which has interpreted this perception as wrong, provides several historical and contemporary evidence for its conclusion. Neither Article 341 nor Article 366 (24), which pertains to the identification of  Scheduled Castes in the Constitution, provides for definitive criteria as to who is a Scheduled Caste. After the Constitution came into force, the list of Scheduled Castes promulgated by the President in 1950 as per Article 341 was based on the ‘Government of India (Schedule Castes) Order-1936’ promulgated by the British in 1936 in accordance with the provisions of the Government of India Act 1935. The Scheduled Caste criteria framed by the British in 1936 has a history.  Although the debate on reservation in British Indian territories started in 1916, Shahu Maharaj in Kolhapur and Wodeyar in Mysore province began an effort to identify the exploited castes and provide reservation in government jobs long before that.  Although their emphasis was mainly on providing reservation to other non-Brahmin savarna castes, there were primary attempts to give reservation to predominantly untouchable castes that did not fall within the Hindu savarna caste framework. Untouchable castes were then known as Depressed Classes. In 1916, for the first time in the British Indian territories, the debate on who should be called the Depressed Class began. An opinion that Adivasis, nomadic-criminal tribes and untouchables will be considered depressed classes took shape. In furtherance of this discussion, the then British Educational Commissioner, Henry Sharp, included a list of Adivasi, tribal, and criminal tribes — and also  those who were  not completely outside the savarna caste framework but extremely backward educationally,  were considered part of the depressed class classification. In 1919, the Southborough Commission used untouchability as a standard criteria for identifying the Depressed Class. In 1931, census commissioner J.H. Hutton established the criteria for untouchability, defining untouchables as those whose touch was considered polluting by members of the savarna society. He identified nine social practices that could help determine untouchability, setting the standard for inclusion in the list of Scheduled Castes. For example, does the savarna society use the water provided by that community? Do Brahmins provide religious services to that community? Do other communities in society, such as barbers and washermen, extend their services to that community? It also included in its list those groups who are considered untouchables not strictly based on their birth, but because of the profession they pursue. The British “Indian Franchise Committee”, formed in 1932 as part of the Round Table conferences to grant Indians self-government, also had the responsibility of demarking  separate constituencies for Scheduled Castes. For that purpose the  Committee had to first identify who constitute Scheduled Castes in different provinces. The different reports the Committee got from different provinces showed how the concept of untouchability and its practice vary from region to region and also community to community among the potential Scheduled Castes.   For example, in some parts of North India, the report recognised that there may be a variance in the degree of restrictions based on the degree of untouchability. For example, a few castes may have been denied entry to a temple as compared to castes which were denied entry to the inner sanctuary of the temple. Also read: Sub-Categorisation Debate: Unanswered Questions The report issued by the then commissioner of undivided Assam recorded the difference between the absolute untouchability experienced by the Jal-Chal castes, in comparison to  untouchable Mahars, who were allowed to serve Hukka to savarnas. Similarly, Bihar and Orissa provinces also recorded that untouchability in their territories was not as severe as the untouchability practised in Madras province or entire South India.  Some of the Franchise Committee members like S.B. Rambe, C.Y. Chintamani and R.R. Bakhale go a step further and argue that untouchability exists only in Madras, Mumbai and Central Provinces, while untouchability in the rest of India exists not because of  birth but because of profession. So they advocated that they should not be considered untouchables. It was then that Ambedkar intervened in the argument and explained the principles of untouchability, arguing that it was wrong to impose the rigidity of untouchability as a uniform standard for determining who is a Scheduled Caste. Ambedkar explained that all forms of untouchability, rigid or not so rigid, stemmed from the same Brahminical notion of pollution and purity.  Not only that, when the First Scheduled List was announced by the President in 1950, out of the 25 castes in (present-day) Madhya Pradesh which were classified as Scheduled Castes, only nine castes were classified as SCs across the state.  Thus, although untouchability is the criterion for SC classification, it makes it clear that there is a difference in the severity and impact of untouchability. Thus, the Supreme Court order makes it clear that castes within SCs cannot be treated as uniformly affected. In addition to that, the Usha Mehra Commission constituted by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) in 2007, through its empirical study especially with regard to the differential backwardness of  castes in the Scheduled Castes list in the then undivided Andhra Pradesh, provides ample evidence that there is persistence of relative social discrimination between the Malas and the Madigas and also glaring difference in the educational status and representation. The Sadashiva commission constituted in 2006 to study the comparative backwardness of the SC communities in Karnataka  has also provided sufficient empirical data to prove the same.  Thus, while the castes classified as Scheduled Castes are most exploited compared to the rest of the society, among them there is a differential impact.   Thus the Scheduled Caste category does not  constitute castes with homogenous social, economic and educational level, since some castes within them are relatively more affected than the others and hence ill-equipped to avail the opportunity of reservation being grouped in the same class.  Therefore, internal reservation is the deepening extension of the principle of reservation, and the reclassification within the Scheduled Castes is complementary and not contrary to the constitutional goal of  social justice. Saga of the people’s movement for sub-classification  It appears from some statements made by the forces that organised the August 21 bandh against sub-classification that many of them are unaware of the decades-long people’s movement for sub-classification within the SC communities, particularly in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. As a result, some of them believe that sub-classification is a ploy to divide the Dalits, assuming that no one had demanded it. However, since the 1990s, the Madiga and Madiga-related communities, as well as the Arundhatiyar communities, have been fighting for internal reservation on the streets for decades in the south Indian states of undivided Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. It is because of these struggles that the then Andhra Pradesh government constituted Justice Ramachandra Raju Commission in 1996 and the Karnataka government formed the Justice Sadashiva Commission to gather empirical data to understand the relative backwardness of the castes within the Scheduled Caste category. Both the commissions had undertaken surveys and came out with verifiable, empirical and scientific data to prove the need for sub-classification among the Scheduled Castes.  The E.V. Chinnaiah’s judgement posed legal hurdles that prevented governments from implementing sub-classification. However, the chief ministers of Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu welcomed the judgement and expressed eagerness to implement it. As a result, none of the political parties or organisations in these states could openly oppose the judgement, even for appearances’ sake. Consequently, the August 21 bandh did not have any impact in these states. But it is another matter that the apex body of the Congress party which is ruling Telangana and Karnataka has postponed any action on the judgement by declaring that the party would take a final stand on the matter after the Mallikarjun Kharge-lead committee give its opinions on the judgement.The national leadership of the BJP remains silent on the judgement although the BJP government in Haryana, that is facing assembly elections in September  has declared its decision to implement subclassification, violating the Model Code of Conduct. The decision is not taken seriously because all the indicators suggest that the chances of BJP forming government in the state is very remote and hence this bold declaration. This analysis sounds logical because none of the other BJP lead states have made any statements about its implementation in their respective states.  Identity politics and the unity of the oppressed Doesn’t internal reservation break the hard-earned unity  of the oppressed as the  Dalits into sub-castes?  Some Dalit friends and intellectuals are raising these apprehensions and are also justified in their worry if this sub-classification precipitates and consolidates differences and hatred among the subcastes instead of the unity.  Still this apprehension refuses to consider the reality of  discrimination based on sub-castes, which is the root cause of the movement based on the identity of sub-castes. Hence their arguments do not reflect the complete reality.    In fact, Ambedkar described pitfalls of such grand standings about grand unity which do not consider the reality of identity-based exclusion in the context of the debate around the unity of Mumbai mill workers. Although the suffering of all the Mumbai mill workers were relatively the same, workers belonging to the untouchable castes faced additional discrimination in the workplace due to their caste identity. Most of the workers belonging to the savarna castes also did not want to allow Dalits to do work which required them to put their saliva on the yarn, etc for reasons of purity and pollution. The communist labour leaders who were then organising mill workers tried to rule out this question to maintain workers’ unity. Ambedkar had warned that labour unity will not be possible as long as this specific injustice within the broader injustice caused by this casteist Brahminism within the workers is not addressed.  Even in post-independence India, efforts to ignore caste-based discrimination within the existing system, or blindly build a nation, build class-based united struggles continued. But since caste identity-based discrimination was a reality, exploited castes-based struggles against caste-based exploitation arose as a parallel stream.  If the relatively advanced castes understood this discrimination and came forward to share the benefits equitably, there would not have been sub-caste based movements, neither it would have been possible for the BJP or the Congress to break the Dalit identity itself. The lesson is just this — when exploitation is a reality, unity cannot be forged just by its denial. Unity is possible only by eliminating all forms of exploitation, particularly internal exploitation. There is a democratic intent to ask for a fair share in the identity struggles of the oppressed.  And it arises when existing identities neglect them. Social justice can only be achieved when emancipatory movements include the identity of the oppressed. It is only through such inclusion  the ‘divide-and-rule’ trickery of the ruling class could be defeated.  Limitation of reservation and internal reservations Beyond all this there is a limit to reservation and internal reservation.  Reservation brings economic and educational upliftment to only one stratum of the exploited communities. And some representation in the state services.  But social justice and economic justice, which are the aspirations of the constitution, are not intended only for liberation of just a strata of the oppressed community. It aspires for liberation of oppressed communities and all-pervading equality. Hence demanding internal reservation will not be very effective without questioning — changing the unscientific Brahminical upper limit of 50% over reservation , and raising  the demand to fulfil backlogs.  Especially in this present neoliberal era of liberalisation, privatisation, and globalisation, when the state is increasingly constricting and becoming an instrument for maximising corporate interests, either seeking representation within such a state without questioning its nature or demanding a fair share of the cake without questioning the diminishing size of the cake would be detrimental to the larger interests of the community and the country. In today’s economy, where inequality has reached its peak, the richest 1% of India’s population holds 32% of the wealth, while the exploi ted community, comprising 50% of the population, possesses only 3%. Social justice and economic justice is impossible without a complete overhaul of this unequal system. If the system is to change, awareness among the oppressed about both the need and limitations of reservation, including internal reservation and unity and united struggle is essential. Therefore, it is vital to maintain this political awareness in the struggle for equality.

Photo Credit: The Hindu The story so far: A seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court has ruled that States have the power to sub-divide Scheduled Castes (SC) into groups so that it can give sub-quotas within the quota for Dalits. In the process, the Bench overruled a 2004 judgment by a five-member Constitution Bench that said such sub-classification was impermissible as Parliament alone was empowered to modify the list of SCs notified by the President under Article 341 of the Constitution. The Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservation) Ordinance, 1999, and the Act that replaced it created four groups — A, B, C and D — of Scheduled Castes and earmarked varying percentages of reservation for each group. The rationale was that there were differences in the level of advancement among communities under the SC list and that such sub-classification will ensure representation for the weaker castes. The Andhra Pradesh High Court rejected the challenge against the Act.                  Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Chirag Paswan says his party will appeal against SC verdict on Dalit sub-groups,"Sub-classification verdict through Ambedkar’s ideals PREMIUM Your choices regarding cookies on this site     Updated - September 05, 2024 11:27 am IST ‘The judgment is a reflection of years of grass-root activism and demands for sub-categorisation’   Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphoto The Supreme Court of India judgment, on August 1, 2024, in The State of Punjab and Ors. vs Davinder Singh and Ors., on the sub-classification of reservations, embodies the vision of social jurisprudence. It is a noteworthy development in Indian jurisprudence, especially in social justice. The judgment provides social jurisprudence using constitutional methods and ensures that social justice reaches the most neglected and deprived sections (which includes a majority of Dalit castes) among Dalits. The idea of sub-classification also aligns with B.R. Ambedkar’s principles of fraternity and Maitri, emphasising the need for cooperation and mutual respect among Scheduled Castes (SC). However, the overreaching exercise of the judgment, reflected in the comments on the varna system and creamy layer, is uncalled for. B.R. Ambedkar struggled all his life to ensure social and civil justice for the most oppressed sections. He also sought to secure separate cultural rights for former untouchables. Yet, these were often met with inadequate responses and resistance from the prevailing Hindu caste order. While reflecting on the Indian social structure, Ambedkar highlights how every jati occupies a distinct position on the social ladder. It draws attention to the nuances of internal divisions within the caste order. A newspaper of his times reported Ambedkar’s response to “the welcome addresses by three scheduled castes’ organisations after the resolutions were disposed of at the Scheduled Castes’ Conference, held at Cawnpore on January 31[,] 1944… He (Ambedkar) urged that they (Scheduled Castes) must realise their responsibility to wipe out internal divisions among the Scheduled Castes when they demanded of other’s removal of Untouchability”.

defense secretary lloyd austin withdraws plea deal for accused 9/11 terrorists,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin withdraws plea deal for accused 9/11 terrorists          WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday withdrew the controversial plea deal for the three men accused of planning the 9/11 attacks. ""Today, Secretary Austin signed a memo reserving for himself the specific authority to enter into pre-trial agreements with the accused in the 9/11 military commission cases,"" the Defense Department said in a press release. ""In addition, as the superior convening authority, the Secretary has also withdrawn from the pre-trial agreements that were signed in those cases."" Austin announced the move in a memo addressed to Susan Escallier, the convening authority for military commissions, who had worked to negotiate the deal. “Effective immediately, I hereby withdraw your authority in the above-referenced case to enter into a pre-trial agreement and reserve such authority to myself,” Austin said in the letter, which removes Escallier from the case. The defense secretary, who designated Escalier to serve as convening authority for military commissions in 2023, said that he made the determination ""in light of the significance"" of the decision to make a plea deal, adding that ""responsibility for such a decision should rest with me."" Officials said on Wednesday that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin ‘Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi had reached plea agreements. The three men were expected to plead guilty to lesser charges that would prevent them from receiving the death penalty, but the terms of the revoked deal remain unknown. The plea deal had been negotiated among the accused men, their attorneys and Escallier. Officials previously said that the accused had been scheduled to appear at a hearing at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba next week. Mohammed is accused of being a mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, which killed 2,977 people. A White House National Security Council spokesperson declined to comment, referring NBC News to the Defense Department. The Defense Department declined to comment beyond the press release. Congressional Republicans celebrated Austin’s decision to revoke the deal.  Rep. Michael McCaul, who chairs the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was “glad to see” Austin’s move. “As I said previously, if any case warrants the death penalty, it’s this one,” said the Texas Republican in a post to X. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that Austin ""did the right thing."" ""The previous plea deal would have sent absolutely the wrong signal to terrorists throughout the world,"" Graham said. ""I know the families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks will appreciate this — as do I."" The head of 9/11 Justice, a self-described grassroots movement of 9/11 victims' families, expressed frustration over families being left out of the discussions regarding the proceedings against the suspects. “We are astounded and deeply frustrated that our families were not consulted or even notified in advance of the plea deal or its subsequent revocation,” said the group's president Brett Eagleson. ""These monsters need to be forced to share every piece of information they have about the attacks and be held fully accountable for the murder of our loved ones."" The plea deal had originally been met with criticism from families of victims and members of Congress. The Republican-led House Oversight Committee said on Friday before Austin announced his decision that it would open an investigation into the White House's role in the plea deal. Similarly, Rep. Mike Rogers, the Alabama Republican who serves as the chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a letter to Austin that he was ""deeply shocked and angered by news"" of a plea deal. Speaker Mike Johnson linked the two GOP-led committees with Austin's decision, saying in a Friday night post to X that ""the Biden-Harris Administration is correct to reverse course after receiving letters from @GOPoversight and @HASCRepublicans launching investigations into this terrible plea deal."" Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who served in the Obama administration, slammed the deal in a Thursday statement. ""The people responsible for structuring this awful deal did the best they could. They were dealt a bad hand by the political hacks and those who lost faith in our justice system,” Holder told NBC News. Holder had said in 2009 that the accused men would be brought to trial in federal court in Manhattan, where they could face the death penalty. While that plan did not come to fruition after members of Congress blocked the transfer of all inmates from Guantánamo Bay in Cuba to the U.S., the slow pace of the defendants' progress through the military commissions system — a form of military tribunal administered by the Defense Department — resulted in some unlikely support for a federal trial.

U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich freed from Russian prison as part of major exchange,"U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich freed from Russian prison as part of major exchange          Four U.S. residents wrongly imprisoned in Russia — including journalist Evan Gershkovich and Marine veteran Paul Whelan — were released Thursday, part of a major multinational prisoner exchange the likes of which has not been seen since the Cold War. The massive deal, cut among seven nations, involves 24 people, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens held in Russia, and eight Russians imprisoned in the U.S., Germany, Slovenia, Norway and Poland. President Joe Biden called the deal that had led to the release of the four U.S. detainees a “feat of diplomacy and friendship.” The exchange took place in Turkey, and a plane carrying U.S. citizens Gershkovich, Whelan and Alsu Kurmasheva touched down at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland at 11:38 p.m. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris greeted all three Americans on the tarmac, and each then hugged friends and family to applause. Biden said he told each, ""welcome home,"" and more. ""There's nothing beyond our capacity when we act together,"" Biden told reporters when asked if he had a message for America. ""We're the United States of America."" Vladimir Kara-Murza, a legal permanent U.S. resident, had planned to go Germany, where his family was set to meet him, but is expected to return to the U.S. soon, the administration said. Follow the latest updates here. “Now, their brutal ordeal is over and they’re free,” Biden said in a televised address from the White House earlier Thursday as he stood alongside family members of those freed. “This is an incredible relief for all the family members gathered here. It’s relief to the friends and colleagues all across the country who have been praying for this day for a long time.” Gershkovich, a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, was arrested in March 2023 while reporting in Yekaterinburg, an industrial city east of Moscow. In July, he was convicted of espionage in a Russian court in a trial widely condemned as a sham as his publication vociferously advocated for his release across its front pages. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Whelan, a businessman who has been detained since visiting Russia for a friend’s wedding in 2018, was also convicted of espionage and had been serving a 16-year sentence in a penal colony. The U.S. has denied those charges. Whelan was excluded from two previous exchanges, and in an interview from prison in December, Whelan told the BBC that he considered the United States’ decision to leave him behind a “serious betrayal.” Kurmasheva is a journalist with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. is a Pulitzer Prize-winning Russian dissident, and dual Russian British national and U.S. permanent resident. He was jailed on treason charges for 25 years in April 2023. Biden noted that Kara-Murza was a pallbearer during the funeral of Sen. John McCain. At one point during his national address, Biden took Kurmasheva’s daughter’s hand and sang a few lines of “Happy Birthday” to her. In a statement, Emma Tucker, The Wall Street Journal’s editor-in-chief, said, “Today is a joyous day for the safe return of our colleague Evan Gershkovich.” “All those who spoke up for Evan and worked for his release ... can know that their support made a huge difference and is greatly, greatly appreciated,” Tucker added. The complex prisoner swap is a rare example of cooperation amid heightened political tensions between the U.S. and Russia, including sanctions imposed on Russia and Russian officials over the invasion of Ukraine starting in 2022. Relations between the two countries had been strained before the war, following Russian interference in the 2016 election and its annexation of Crimea. The most notable Russian prisoner released as part of the swap is Vadim Krasikov, who was jailed for life in Germany for the 2019 murder in Berlin of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former Chechen separatist, in what prosecutors believed was a Russian state-sanctioned assassination. Russian authorities said they believed Khangoshvili was involved in multiple attacks on Russian soil, including the 2010 suicide bombings on the Moscow Metro. The U.S. released three Russian prisoners, including an intelligence operative facing charges of smuggling U.S. technology and ammunition to the Russian military. Slovenia released two Russian prisoners; Norway and Poland each released one. Russia released five German prisoners, as well as seven Russian citizens who were political prisoners held in their own country, according to a statement from the White House. Later, Biden said four of them were connected to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in prison in February following a yearslong struggle against official corruption and President Vladimir Putin’s government that included several poisoning attempts. Former Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev responded to the swap by saying that he would like “the traitors of Russia to rot in prison or die in jail, as has often happened. But it is more useful to get out our own, who worked for the country, for the Fatherland, for all of us.” “And let the traitors now feverishly select new names and actively disguise themselves under a witness protection program,” he added. The Biden administration has been working on Thursday’s swap since December 2022 after WNBA star Brittney Griner was exchanged for notorious Russian arms dealer Victor Bout, known as the “Merchant of Death.” Griner was arrested at an airport near Moscow after two vape cartridges containing hashish oil were found in her luggage. The swap raised a debate about the risks of exchanging wrongfully detained Americans for Russian prisoners, with critics pointing out that there was no equivalence between the crimes Griner and Bout were convicted of, and that it may encourage foreign adversaries to kidnap Americans abroad and use them as bargaining chips. National security adviser Jake Sullivan called the exchange “historic” and said that not since the Cold War has there been one involving such a large number of people, “and there has never, so far as we know, been an exchange involving so many countries, so many close U.S. partners and allies working together.” The deal was “the culmination of many rounds of complex, painstaking negotiations over many, many months,” he added. Biden said on the tarmac of Joint Base Andrews that other countries made difficult decisions in making the exchange happen. He singled out Germany, which agreed to release a convicted hitman who killed someone in Berlin, and the chancellor of Slovenia. ""The toughest call on this one was for other countries, because I asked them to do some things that were against their immediate self-interests,"" Biden said. ""And it was very difficult for them to do."" Carol E. Lee is the Washington managing editor. Aurora Almendral is a London-based editor with NBC News Digital.

Middle East on knife-edge after alleged Israeli killing of Hamas leader in Iran,"Briefing Security Council in Wake of Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh's Killing in Tehran, Under-Secretary-General Calls for Regional De-escalation  Alarmed by this morning’s killing of Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which comes on the heels of several recent escalatory events in the Middle East, the UN top political affairs official called today for diplomatic efforts to change the region’s trajectory towards peace and stability. “The international community must work together to prevent any actions that could make the conflict much bigger and wider very quickly,” said Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, as she briefed the Security Council. Earlier today, Mr. Haniyeh was killed in Tehran where he had been at the invitation of Iran’s Government, to attend the inauguration ceremony of the president-elect, Masoud Pezeshkian.  In a letter to the Council President, Iran accused Israel of carrying out the attack, citing it as a “serious infringement” of its sovereignty and territory integrity. Urging regional de-escalation, she said that “while violence continues unabated in Gaza after months of relentless diplomatic efforts, the situation across the Blue Line and inside Lebanon is on an increasingly worrying path”.  In a tragic incident on 27 July, 12 children were killed, and dozens injured in an apparent strike on a soccer field in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan. On 30 July, the Israel Defense Forces claimed a “targeted strike” in Beirut that killed a Hizbullah commander, Fuad Shukr, allegedly responsible for the deaths in Majdal Shams, she said, noting that at least five people were killed, including two children, and many more injured. In the ensuing discussion, numerous Council members sounded the alarm over the escalations during the past 48 hours in the Middle East, warning that developments in Iran and Lebanon could plunge the region into even greater despair. Among them was Algeria’s delegate who condemned the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh by Israel as “not merely an attack on one man”, but “a vicious assault on the very foundations of diplomatic relations, the sanctity of State sovereignty and the principles that underpin our global order”.  He called on Israel to completely and irrevocably end its occupation of Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese territories. Underscoring the need to respect international law, Sierra Leone’s delegate also condemned the killing on Iranian territory as violating that country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Recalling the International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan’s filing of applications for arrest warrants against Mr. Haniyeh, he stated: “If there was ever a quest for justice, that is the justice and accountability our multilateral system based on the rule of law allows for, and not by unlawful killing.” Israel’s delegate said that Tehran — “the very engine driving the machinery of death and destruction that threatens us all” — has used its proxies to target his country and its citizens from every direction. “Where were the condemnations of Hizbullah and their Iranian supplier for the butchery of the innocent children” playing in the Druze town of Majdal Shams, he asked.  On Israel’s precise strike against Hizbullah commander Fu’ad Shukr, he said this operation sends a clear message:  “We will defend ourselves and respond with great force against those who harm us.” The speaker for the United States reiterated Israel’s right to defend itself against attacks from terrorists, stating:  “That is precisely what it did” on 30 July when it independently responded to Hizbullah’s 28 July attack, which killed 12 children.  He emphasized that Washington, D.C., was not involved with Israel’s response on 30 July in Lebanon and in the apparent death of the Hamas leader. Also expressing support for Israel’s right to self-defence, his counterpart from the United Kingdom rejected the attempts of Tehran and its proxies — including Hizbullah and the Houthis — to use the suffering of those in Gaza as justification for further violence.  Calling for diplomatic negotiations, she asserted that “long-term peace will not be secured by bombs and bullets”. Rejecting this narrative, the representative of the Russian Federation, Council President for July, spoke in his national capacity to warn against the dangerous consequences of the assassination of Hamas’ political leader, including dragging Iran into regional confrontation.  This is “a serious blow to mediation negotiations between Hamas and Israel towards a ceasefire in Gaza”, he stated, underscoring that “the key to de-escalation is an end to the bloodshed in [the Strip]”. The representative of Syria said that, a few days ago, the Israeli occupying entity perpetrated a horrific crime in Majdal Shams, which belongs to her country.  The territory’s Arab Syrians reject Israeli occupation.  Despite its attempts to cover up this crime, Israel is responsible, he said, adding that — under Article 51 of the UN Charter — an occupying entity cannot claim self-defence. The Deputy Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine condemned the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh — former Palestinian Prime Minister and head of the Political Bureau of Hamas — as “the criminal breach” of Iran’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Israel openly declares its intentions to carry on with its scorched-earth killing and destruction spree in Gaza, she said, calling for full accountability for all the crimes perpetrated, and support for the Palestinian people to end the illegal occupation and apartheid regime. Israel’s aggression reached “our capital, Beirut”, said Lebanon’s delegate, warning against its objective to drag its allies into a regional war with disastrous consequences.  “Lebanon and its people do not want war,” he declared, urging Israel to withdraw from lands that it continues to occupy and stop violating his country’s sovereignty by ground, sea and air.  He described Tuesday’s aggression by Israel targeting the southern suburb of Beirut as “the most dangerous chapter of the conflict so far”. Iran’s delegate said Israel’s assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is yet another manifestation of that country’s decades-long pattern of terrorism targeting Palestinians and their supporters.  “Palestinian resistance groups like Hamas and other resistance groups in the region are not terrorists”, but legitimate groups under international law, established to fight against occupation, he said. He further underscored that Washington, D.C. — Israel’s strategic ally — has a responsibility, and this act could not have happened without its authorization and support.  For nearly 10 months, certain countries — particularly the United States — have shielded Israel from any responsibility for the massacre in Gaza and other malicious activities in the region, shamelessly justifying the Israeli genocide under the pretext of self-defence.  Urging the Council to hold Israel accountable, he asserted that Iran “reserves its inherent right to self-defence, in accordance with international law to respond decisively to this terrorist and criminal act when it deems necessary and appropriate”. THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST Briefing ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, briefing the Council on alarming developments in the Middle East, said that, earlier today, Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas’ political bureau, was killed, together with a bodyguard in Tehran.  Mr. Haniyeh had been in Tehran, at the invitation of Iran’s Government, to attend the inauguration ceremony of the new President, Masoud Pezeshkian.  In a letter to the Council President today, Iran accused Israel of carrying out an attack that killed Mr. Haniyeh and claimed it was a “serious infringement” of Iran’s sovereignty and territory integrity and constituted a “blatant violation” of international law.  Iran’s Supreme Leader and other senior officials have vowed to avenge Mr. Haniyeh’s death, warning Israel of “harsh punishment […] intended to instil deep regret in the perpetrator.”  Various non-State armed groups aligned with Iran across the region have also threatened to retaliate against Israel, she added. In a live broadcast to the nation a few hours ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had launched strikes against three fronts, including Hamas, Hizbullah and the Houthis.  He emphasized that Israel was fighting an existential war with Iran.  Today’s strike in Tehran follows in the wake of several recent escalatory events in the region.  “While violence continues unabated in Gaza after months of relentless diplomatic efforts, the situation across the Blue Line and inside Lebanon is on an increasingly worrying path,” she said.  In a tragic incident on 27 July, 12 children were killed, and dozens injured in an apparent strike on a soccer field in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan. She said that, according to Israel Defense Forces, an Iranian-made Falaq-1 rocket was fired by Hizbullah from north of Shebaa village in southern Lebanon.  The strike — for which Hizbullah denied responsibility — followed months of increasingly intense exchanges across the Blue Line with Lebanon and hundreds of aerial attacks toward Israel from various locations across the region that Israel has attributed to Iran-backed forces.  On 30 July, the Israel Defense Forces issued a statement claiming a “targeted strike” in Beirut on a Hizbullah commander allegedly responsible for the deaths in Majdal Shams.  Hizbullah confirmed that a senior commander, Fuad Shukr — also known as Hajj Mohsin — was killed.  According to Lebanon’s Ministry of Health, at least five people were killed, including two children, in the attack and many more injured. She observed that the various attacks over the past few days have taken place amidst the ongoing war and a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, where Hamas continues to hold hostages abducted from Israel on 7 October 2023.  Most recently, on 27 July, an Israeli strike, killing dozens, including children, took place on a school in Deir al Balah where thousands of displaced Palestinians were sheltering.  “This was yet another reminder of the terrible toll of the war on civilians,” she stated.  Earlier today, an Al-Jazeera journalist and his cameraman were killed reportedly by an Israeli air strike in Gaza while they were reporting from Mr. Haniyeh’s home. Echoing the words of the UN Secretary-General who has “consistently called for maximum restraint by all”, she said that “it is increasingly clear, however, that restraint alone is insufficient at this extremely sensitive time”.  Diplomatic efforts to change the trajectory and seek a path towards regional peace and stability are urgently needed, she said, stressing that “communication by means of missiles, armed drones and other deadly attacks must end”.  Instead, she called for regional de-escalation and underscored that “the international community must work together to prevent any actions that could make the conflict much bigger and wider very quickly”. Statements The representative of China, condemning the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, said it is “a blatant attempt to sabotage peace efforts” and a violation of State sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Expressing concern about the exacerbation of the upheaval in the region, he added that, despite the adoption of Council resolution 2735 (2024), ceasefire negotiations have not yet yielded results.  Highlighting the tensions between Israel and Lebanon, as well as Syria and the situation in the Red Sea, he expressed objections to Israel’s attack on southern Beirut, and stressed that the continued deterioration is directly attributable to the inability to implement a ceasefire.  Israel must stop its collective punishment of Gaza, and countries with influence must do their part “to put out the flames of war”, he added. The representative of Algeria condemned the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh by Israel as “not merely an attack on one man”, but “a vicious assault on the very foundations of diplomatic relations, the sanctity of State sovereignty and the principles that underpin our global order”.  Israel has embraced a blood-shedding, scorched-earth policy, leaving destruction in its wake — a relentless tide of violence flooding Gaza, the West Bank, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and now Iran.  “These are not acts of self-defence,” he said, calling for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire in Gaza and the lifting of the inhumane blockade of the Strip. Israel must completely and irrevocably end its occupation of Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese territories, he demanded, also urging full accountability for the occupying Power’s heinous war crimes and egregious human rights violations and unwavering compliance with all Security Council resolutions. The representative of Guyana warned that “the situation in the Middle East is approaching a boiling point”.  It appears that some regional actors are intent on returning to the days where scores — real or imagined — were settled by the most brutal means, she said, adding that “we cannot afford to resort to primitive approaches to settling disputes”.  Accordingly, she condemned the constant disregard for international law in the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, including the recent violations of both Iran’s and Lebanon’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.  However, she pointed out, “it will be a grave mistake to view the recent incidents in isolation to what is taking place in the Gaza Strip”.  All the illegalities that have stemmed from various fronts in the Middle East since 7 October 2023 must be seen through the prism of the ongoing war in Gaza — “a war that continues to mutilate and annihilate innocent civilians, the majority of whom are women and children, [and] continues to kill journalists and aid workers at unprecedented levels”, she stated. The representative of the Republic of Korea, recalling his delegation’s concerns about the escalation of conflict in the region, said:  “Such anxieties have now become a reality.”  While the ceasefire deal in Gaza remains unrealized, there have been attacks in the occupied Golan Heights and subsequent Israeli attacks on southern Beirut.  Such incidents may result in an irreversible spiral of hostilities, he said, adding that these escalations have also affected the efforts to bring about a ceasefire and enable humanitarian aid access in Gaza.  Stressing the need for an urgent ceasefire, he said the choices that major players make next can “fundamentally alter the political and security landscape in the Middle East”.  Appealing for de-escalation, he called on the major actors to act with utmost restraint.  The representative of the United States underscored Israel’s right to defend itself against attacks from Hizbullah and other terrorists.  “That is precisely what it did” on 30 July when it independently responded to Hizbullah’s 28 July attack, which killed 12 children.  Washington, D.C., was not involved with Israel’s response on 30 July in Lebanon.  Hizbullah is not the only Iranian-backed group in the region taking advantage of the situation in Gaza to undermine regional peace and security.  The Houthis are brazenly violating international law with their attacks on commercial and merchant vessels in the Red Sea.  The United States was not involved in the apparent death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and has no independent confirmation as to Hamas’ claims regarding his death, he said.  For its part, the United States will continue to lead the way in diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza and reduce regional tensions.  Preventing a broader regional war starts with finalizing an agreement for an immediate ceasefire with the release of hostages in Gaza, he said, pledging that his country will continue to work in partnership with Egypt, Qatar and other regional partners to seek to deliver an agreement.  He then urged Council members with direct influence over Iran to increase pressure on it to stop escalating its proxy conflict against Israel and other actors. The representative of Mozambique condemned today’s air strike in Iran, which resulted in the death of Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh, voicing concern that “this tragic event can potentially inflame the tensions between Israel and its neighbours and trigger conflicts with far-reaching negative impacts on regional and international peace and security”.  He urged both parties to exercise maximum restraint and approach the situation with high caution to prevent further escalation of the conflict.  The current events can compromise diplomatic efforts aimed at reaching an agreement leading to a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages still under Hamas captivity, he warned.  He emphasized that Israel must comply with international legal standards and agreements, including the International Court of Justice rulings.  Furthermore, the Council must continue to closely monitor the situation and take all possible measures to prevent any further escalation that may result from this attack. The representative of France, expressing alarm about the possibility of a conflagration in the Middle East, said Iran must stop supporting destabilizing actors.  Her country is committed to regional stability and the security of its regional partners, she said, adding that everything must be done to avoid a war with devastating consequences.  Her Government has conveyed this to the actors concerned, she said, also expressing condolences to the civilian victims of the attacks that took place in the Syrian Golan.  Reaffirming support for the mandate of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), she said this is crucial for de-escalation in Lebanon.  Calling for an immediate ceasefire, and the release of all hostages, she stressed that only a two-State solution is viable.  The representative of the United Kingdom urged calm and called for immediate restraint, stating that her country’s Foreign Secretary is in the region reiterating this call and encouraging de-escalation.  “The path to peace must be through diplomatic negotiations,” she said, adding:  “Long-term peace will not be secured by bombs and bullets.”  She noted Iran’s role in destabilizing the region through its use of proxies including Lebanese Hizbullah and the Houthis, citing reckless attacks launched by the Houthis against Tel Aviv and Hizbullah rockets fired on innocent children in Majdal Shams.  “These attacks are enabled by the continued supply of advanced weaponry by Iran, especially missiles, to proxy groups,” she said, adding:  “This must cease.”  Expressing support for Israel’s right to defend itself, she rejected Iran’s and their proxies’ attempts to use the suffering of those in Gaza as justification for further violence. The representative of Japan expressed concern that “the region is closer than ever to a large-scale conflict that would be difficult to contain”.  The events of the past few days have shown how fragile the situation is, she observed, condemning the reported rocket attack on 27 July that killed 12 children and youth and wounded many others in the Golan Heights.  Noting Israel’s air strike in Beirut on 30 July, as well as the news of the killing of Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh last night, she stated:  “Let us not forget that the conflict began with the heinous 7 October 2023 attack on Israel and the taking of hostages by Hamas and other groups.”  The ensuing hostilities in Gaza have caused unimaginable suffering for Palestinians and the fighting has reverberated across the region, from the West Bank to Lebanon to Yemen to Syria to Iran, she said, underscoring the need to prevent a wider conflict that “would only inflict more bloodshed and devastation in the Middle East”. The representative of Switzerland, rejecting the spiral of violence and urging a return to diplomacy, said all actors and those who have influence over them must show utmost restraint.  All channels of communication must be used, he said, adding that there is no military solution to the conflict.  International law, including the United Nations Charter, and the sovereignty of all nations in the region must be respected, he added.  Stressing that civilians must never be targeted, he reiterated the call for an immediate ceasefire and release of all hostages, and said negotiations must continue in good faith. The representative of Slovenia, pointing to the death of children in armed conflict, said that “the life of a Druze child is equal to that of a Gazan child, is equal to that of a Lebanese child, an Israeli child, any child across the world”.  Calling for maximum restraint by all actors, he said that “there is no military solution to the crisis that is unfolding before our eyes”.  The positions expressed by Israel, Lebanon and Iran in letters to the Security Council share a common thread — a concern for regional stability.  The Council should pronounce itself on this situation if only to call for de-escalation and the pursuit of dialogue and diplomacy.  While the crisis in the Middle East has a long history and a variety of root causes, the latest spiral is being exacerbated by what is happening in Gaza, he said, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the full implementation of resolution 2735 (2024). The representative of Malta expressed deep concern about the escalations during the past 48 hours in the Middle East, warning that “developments in Iran and Lebanon have the potential to spark further conflict and plunge the region into even greater despair”.  Calling on all parties to exercise restraint, prioritize de-escalation and pursue peaceful solutions to all disputes, she stressed that all remaining hostages must be unconditionally released, and all parties must understand that extrajudicial executions are illegal under international law.  “The prospect of a full-blown regional conflict remains worryingly present,” she observed, adding that “it would lead to a crisis of untold proportions in the region, hitting the most vulnerable, women and children in particular”.  Underscoring that efforts towards an immediate and permanent ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza must not cease, she said that “it is only through the prevention of a regional conflict that we can restore a credible political horizon to address the situation in the Middle East”. The representative of Ecuador, reiterating calls for restraint and caution, said any actions that can lead to regional destabilization must be avoided.  Stressing the urgent need for negotiations towards a ceasefire and the release of hostages, he said the immediate implementation of Council resolution 2735 (2024) is the fastest way to end the violence.  Further, all parties must work towards a just solution, he said, reaffirming that the two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living in peace, within 1967 borders, is the only way to definitively end this conflict. The representative of Sierra Leone condemned the killing by Israel of Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian territory as violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iran, citing Article 2, Paragraph 4, of the UN Charter, which provides that “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner, inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations”.  As a State party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Sierra Leone has followed Court proceedings after Prosecutor Karim Khan’s filing of applications for arrest warrants against Mr. Haniyeh.  “If there was ever a quest for justice, that is the justice and accountability our multilateral system based on the rule of law allows for, and not by unlawful killing,” he insisted. The representative of the Russian Federation, Council President for July, spoke in his national capacity to voice concern over the extremely dangerous escalation in the Middle East and condemn the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh.  This provocation attack was carried out at a time when he was in Iran, officially invited to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the new President, Masoud Pezeshkian.  “Those who are behind this political assassination must know how dangerous the consequences could be for the entire region,” he cautioned, noting that this is “a serious blow to mediation negotiations between Hamas and Israel towards a ceasefire in Gaza”.  He warned against efforts to drag Iran into a regional confrontation, noting that it will destabilize a region that is already at a boiling point, stressing that “the key to de-escalation is an end to the bloodshed in Gaza”. The representative of Iran condemned Israel’s assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the great leader of the Palestinian people’s legitimate struggle for self-determination.  Mr. Haniyeh was in Teheran on official invitation from his Government to attend the inauguration of the country’s new President, he recalled, adding that he was targeted, alongside his companion, in his residence in Tehran at around 2 a.m. local time on 31 July.  This is yet another manifestation of Israel’s decades-long pattern of terrorism targeting Palestinians and their supporters, he said.  But, in addition to its terrorist objective, Israel was “also pursuing a political goal with this act”, aiming to disrupt the first day of his country’s new Government, he added.  “This crime is not isolated,” he said, adding that it is part of a broader pattern of aggression against countries of the region.  Hours before this heinous crime, Israel’s regime carried out cowardly terrorist attacks in the southern suburbs of Beirut, targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, he noted. The United States has a responsibility, he stressed, as a strategic ally of Israel.  This act could not have happened without its authorization and support.  Despite the tragic loss of life and the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the Council has not taken any action, thus emboldening this callous regime, and encouraging it to commit attacks against other countries in the region.  His country has exercised maximum restraint, he said, recalling Israel’s terrorist attack on Iran’s diplomatic premises in Damascus on 1 April.  Despite notifications to the Council and the Secretary-General, there were no consequences, he noted.  A draft press statement proposed by the Russian Federation condemning Israel was blocked by the United States, he pointed out. For nearly 10 months, he said, certain countries, particularly the United States, have shielded Israel from any responsibility for the massacre in Gaza and other malicious activities in the region.  These countries have not only denied the right of Palestinian resistance groups to self-defence against Israeli atrocities, but have also shamelessly justified the Israeli genocide under the pretext of self-defence.  “Palestinian resistance groups like Hamas and other resistance groups in the region are not terrorists,” he stressed, adding that they are legitimate groups under international law, established to fight against occupation.  The Council must hold Israel accountable, including by considering the imposition of sanctions, and other measures.  Iran, he added, “reserves its inherent right to self-defence, in accordance with international law to respond decisively to this terrorist and criminal act when it deems necessary and appropriate”. The Deputy Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine condemned the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, former Palestinian Prime Minister and head of the Political Bureau of Hamas, in Tehran on 31 July, as “the criminal breach” of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iran.  A national day of mourning has been declared in Palestine.  She also condemned the repeated breaches by Israel of the territorial integrity of Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, including Tuesday’s brazen attack on Beirut.  Israel openly declares its intentions to carry on with its scorched-earth killing and destruction spree in Gaza, mocking the Security Council, General Assembly and the international community as a whole.  The international community must confront this reality and act immediately to stop these crimes and aggressions, she said, declaring:  “There is no right that Israel can claim to justify these illegal actions.  The right to peace and security is the right of all States […]; it is not an exclusive right for Israel.” The Council and all States should uphold their responsibilities and obligations to end Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people, she asserted, urging them to prevent the former’s continued violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States in the region and avert a regional war. She also called for desperately needed humanitarian relief for Palestinians, full accountability for all the crimes perpetrated, and support for the Palestinian people to end the illegal occupation and apartheid regime.  “Only this will fulfil our shared yearning and duty to achieve peace in the Middle East where all peoples can live in security and dignity,” she emphasized. The representative of Israel, citing the hypocrisy displayed by the Council, said this meeting has been called for by “the number one sponsor of terrorism”, responsible for the most horrifying barbarism across the region — Iran.  Tehran has used its proxies — Hamas and Hizbullah — to target Israel and its citizens from every direction.  Just last week, children were innocently playing soccer in the Druze town of Majdal Shams when an Iranian-supplied Hizbullah rocket murdered 12 of them.  “Where were the condemnations of Hizbullah and their Iranian supplier for the butchery of these innocent children?”, he asked. Yesterday, Israel carried out a precise strike against Hizbullah commander Fu’ad Shukr — a senior terrorist with the blood of Israelis and many others on his hands.  This operation sends a clear message:  “We will defend ourselves and respond with great force against those who harm us.”  He emphasized that the world must support Israel at this time.  Detailing Iran’s arms supplies to Hizbullah and Hamas, he underscored that the country uses its proxies to the detriment of Israel.  Underscoring the need to address the roots of this escalation, he cited Tehran as “the very engine driving the machinery of death and destruction that threatens us all”. The representative of Syria said that a few days ago, the Israeli occupying entity perpetrated a horrific crime in Majdal Shams, which is Syrian and not Israeli.  Stressing that it has been part of the occupied Syrian Golan since 1967, he said this resulted in the death of 12 Syrian children.  The occupying authorities have tried to shirk responsibility and cover up this crime, he said, rejecting all such lies, and reaffirming that the occupied Syrian Golan has and always will be his country’s territory.  The occupied citizens in that territory are Arab Syrians and they reject Israeli occupation, he said.  Reiterating that Israel is responsible for this crime, he added that, under Article 51 of the UN Charter, an occupying entity cannot claim that they are defending themselves.  Rejecting the United States delegate’s statement justifying the occupation of the Syrian Golan because it is essential for Israeli security, he said that the maintenance of international peace and security demands that United States Administrations must renounce their destructive policies. The Zionist entity has perpetrated yet another crime in Tehran this morning, he said, noting that before that, Israel targeted a residential building in southern Beirut, leading to the martyrdom of several people in this densely populated neighbourhood.  Expressing solidarity with other States facing Israeli aggression, he said that such actions could lead to a conflagration in the region.  The genocide perpetrated by Israel in Gaza in the last 10 months has targeted hospitals, journalists and hundreds of United Nations workers.  The war criminals from Israel would not have been able to continue their war crimes without the double standards of Western States, he added.  However, he underscored, such aggressions will not weaken the determination of the people of the region to liberate occupied territories. The representative of Lebanon said that Israel’s aggression reached “our capital, Beirut”.  The culprit is the Government of Israel and its Prime Minister.  The victim is “your ceasefire resolution”.  The objective is to drag Israel’s allies into a regional war with disastrous consequences on peoples and countries, and on the present and the future.  “Lebanon and its people do not want war,” he said, voicing his country’s commitment to Council resolution 1701 (2006). Lebanon put forth a road map and a vision to reach a solution that would preserve its rights and maintain stability throughout its southern borders.  This was a courageous initiative to break the cycle of violence and create an environment of dignified living for its people.  However, his Government has not received any serious response to its proposal. To implement resolution 1701 (2006), Israel must withdraw from lands that it continues to occupy and stop violating Lebanon’s sovereignty by ground, sea and air, he asserted, warning that Tuesday’s aggression by Israel targeting the southern suburb of Beirut is “the most dangerous chapter of the conflict so far”.  He also condemned Israel’s assassination operation in Tehran “only hours” after the attack on the Beirut suburb.  Citing the orders issued by the International Court of Justice, he urged Israel to end its occupation of Arab territories.  “No one believes that the confrontation will end as long as occupation exists,” he said.  In light of the Council’s continued paralysis and inability to implement its resolutions on Israel, “our faith has been shaken”, he lamented, observing that international legitimacy is no longer enough to maintain peace and security.  Therefore, “the Council must amend its approach and take a firm stand before it is too late”. The representative of Iraq underscored that the 7 October 2023 attacks could not be seen separately from Israel’s occupation, noting that — after years of conflict, bloodshed and building settlements — the Council has been unable to find a comprehensive end to it.  For decades, the international community has used every track to end the Israeli occupation and its aggressive policies against the Palestinian people.  Warning against the escalation of the war and its repercussions for regional peace and security, he said that Israel’s aggression against Palestine, Lebanon and Syria “is no longer self-defence” — as claimed by that country — but a reprisal and genocide.  Against that backdrop, he urged the Council to assume responsibility, end the war in Gaza, save lives, open border crossings, deliver humanitarian aid and protect the Palestinian people. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that another wave of deadly attacks struck Ukraine today. In Lviv — a regional centre in western Ukraine and home to many displaced people — that city suffered one of the deadliest attacks since the escalation of the war.

IDF targets Beirut suburb in retaliation for attack that killed 12 in the Golan Heights,"Israel says it killed Hezbollah leader in Beirut strike after attack on Golan Heights          Israel’s military says it has killed a Hezbollah official who it blamed for a deadly attack last week on the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 young people. The Israel Defense Forces said it killed Fuad Shukr on Tuesday in an airstrike in the area of Beirut in Lebanon. The IDF said that Shukr “was the commander responsible for the murder of the 12 children in Majdal Shams in northern Israel on Saturday evening, as well as the killing of numerous Israelis and foreign nationals over the years.” Israel was targeting Shukr, better known by his nickname, Hajj Mohsen, in the strike in a suburb of southern Beirut, an Israeli official told NBC News. Mohsen is a senior adviser to Hezbollah’s supreme leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a member of the group’s military council, according to a U.S. government profile. Shukr “has the blood of many Israelis on his hands. Tonight, we have shown that the blood of our people has a price, and that there is no place out of reach for our forces to this end,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the rocket attack Saturday, which struck a soccer field in the Golan Heights. Militants in Lebanon and Israel have been trading fire since Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel and the start of the war in Gaza, raising fears that the fighting will spiral into a regional conflict. Al Manar, a satellite television station run by Hezbollah, reported that Israel had ""launched an aerial aggression that targeted the southern suburb of Beirut."" ""Local sources reported that the raid in the Haret Hreik area was carried out by a drone and 3 missiles were fired,"" the report added. The television station also said a building Israel targeted in the Haret Hreik area, a Hezbollah stronghold, had collapsed. Al Manar reported that two people were killed and at least 10 were wounded in the strike. Personnel from the emergency room at Bahman Hospital in Beirut told NBC News that a woman was killed and 17 other people were wounded, including six children and two who were in critical condition. In a statement, the Lebanese Red Cross said more than one person had been killed and over 20 had been injured. The Lebanese Health Ministry said a woman was killed and up to 68 other people were injured, five of them critically. Photographs from the area also showed cars crushed and covered with rubble. Saturday's strike on Majdal Shams killed at least 12 people, most of them children and teenagers belonging to the minority Druze community. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack. In a series of statements Saturday, it did say it had struck nearby military targets in the Golan Heights. In one statement, it claimed to have used a Falaq-1 rocket, the same munition Israel says hit the soccer field. However, the timings in the Hezbollah statements do not neatly align with the strike. Hezbollah said the Falaq-1 rocket was fired at 5:20 p.m., while the IDF says Majdal Shams was hit at 6:18 p.m. The Israeli military said the attack on Majdal Shams, which is on the border with Lebanon, was the deadliest strike on civilians in Israeli territory since Oct. 7. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed back to Tel Aviv from the U.S. as outrage built in Israel. “Israel is approaching the moment of an all-out war against Hezbollah,” the Israeli military said at the time. “The IDF is prepared and ready to protect Israel’s security.” In January, an Israeli airstrike on Beirut killed Saleh Arouri, a top Hamas official. It was the first time Israel had hit Beirut since the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Asked for comment Tuesday's strike, a White House National Security Council spokesperson told NBC News that the agency defers to Israel ""to speak to its own military operations"" but supports its right to defend itself. ""Our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad and unwavering against all Iran-backed threats, including Hezbollah, and we are working on a diplomatic solution that will allow citizens to safely return to their homes,"" the spokesperson said. Israel’s military said that Shukr joined Hezbollah in 1985 and that he was the head of Hezbollah’s Strategic Unit and had responsibility for weaponry that included missiles, rockets and drones.

Elon Musk attends Netanyahu’s speech to Congress as his guest; dozens of members skip,"Elon Musk attends Netanyahu’s speech to Congress as his guest, but dozens of lawmakers skip it                                                                                                                      Elon Musk made a surprise appearance in Washington Wednesday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress, attending the event as Netanyahu’s guest. Musk sat in Netanyahu’s private box in the visitors gallery above the House floor, alongside Netanyahu’s wife Sara, several Israeli soldiers and at least one former hostage of Hamas. The Tesla Motors CEO’s visit to Capitol Hill came a day after he announced on X that his satellite internet company Starlink had been activated in a Gaza hospital, with the support of Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Nine months into the Israel-Hamas war and the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Netanyahu’s speech has become a lightning rod of controversy, triggering an eruption of protests in Washington. Shortly before Netanyahu was scheduled to begin speaking, U.S. Capitol Police announced they were “deploying pepper spray” against protesters who had “started to become violent” close to the Capitol. Netanyahu scolded the protesters in his speech, calling them “Iran’s useful idiots.” “These protesters chant from river to the sea, but many don’t have a clue what river and what sea they’re talking about.” Netanyahu said. More than 30 members of Congress did not attend Netanyahu’s address, many of them skipping the event in protest of the Israeli prime minister’s approach to the Israel-Hamas war. One of Netanyahu’s most vocal opponents in Congress, however, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., did attend the speech. At several points, Tlaib held up a sign that read “War Criminal.” The clear breach of House decorum reflects the deep and painful divisions in Congress over the prime minister’s leadership. Despite the absences, the prime minister entered a crowded House floor to loud applause and cheering, shaking hands with various lawmakers on his way to the podium. “America and Israel must stand together because when we stand together something very simple happens. We win, they lose,” Netanyahu said at the opening of his remarks. The Prime Minister expressed gratitude to President Joe Biden “for his heartfelt support for Israel.” “President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years,” Netanyahu said. “I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel.” Biden and Netanyahu are scheduled to meet at the White House on Thursday. Vice President Kamala Harris did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, a conspicuous departure from tradition. The White House attributed her absence to the demands of travel. Harris will have a separate meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday. Typically, the vice president presides over joint congressional sessions, but Harris is traveling Wednesday, as the newly minted Democratic front-runner for the party’s presidential nomination. Former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also skipped the speech due to his “duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for Vice President,” a Trump campaign official told NBC News. In the vice president’s absence, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., would usually take her place as the president pro tempore of the Senate, but she did not attend Netanyahu’s address for ideological reasons, according to NBC News. Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Md., presided over Netanyahu’s joint address. “The United States relationship with the State of Israel transcends politics and partisanship,” Cardin said in a statement to NBC News. “It transcends any one Israeli government or any one U.S. administration.” Though Harris attributed her Wednesday absence to travel, many of the at least 30 lawmakers said they skipped the speech to boycott Netanyahu. Several, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said they would instead meet with families of hostages held by Hamas or attend a panel on Middle East peace and security. “Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress. On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., among the loudest critics of Netanyahu as the war carries on. Wednesday’s speech was Netanyahu’s fourth address to Congress, the last of which took place in March 2015. While the Prime Minister is on Capitol Hill, he will meet with the top four congressional lawmakers: House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

"Biden announces new NATO aid for Ukraine, as his reelection campaign teeters ","Biden announces new NATO aid for Ukraine, as his reelection campaign teeters                                                                                                                      President Joe Biden announced new commitments to help Ukraine bolster its air defense against Russia in a speech Tuesday commemorating NATO’s 75th anniversary. “Putin wants nothing less — nothing less — than Ukraine’s total subjugation, to end Ukraine’s democracy,” Biden said. “We know Putin won’t stop at Ukraine. But make no mistake: Ukraine can and will stop Putin, especially with our full collective support.” The aid will include new batteries and components for Patriot missile systems, donated by the U.S., Germany, Romania, the Netherlands and other partners. Italy will donate an additional SAMP-T missile system. Speaking from a teleprompter, Biden said that more air defense supplies will be distributed to Ukraine in the coming months. The announcement comes over two years into brutal invasion of Ukraine led by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a war that has become a point of contention on Capitol Hill as lawmakers remain divided on whether to keep providing funds for Ukraine’s defense. Biden’s speech also served as the latest example of the split screen looming over the 2024 NATO summit this week: As the president holds high-stakes meetings with foreign allies, his political future in the U.S. Democratic Party is on the line. The president’s Tuesday remarks were another opportunity for him to assuage Democratic fears about his 2024 candidacy, following his disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump in June. Since then, cracks have emerged within the Democratic Party as some lawmakers, donors and strategists publicly urge Biden to bow out of the race and allow a new nominee to step forward. Earlier Tuesday, House Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., joined the growing tally of Democratic lawmakers officially calling on Biden to drop out. Others have expressed continued support for the president in public statements, while voicing their reservations behind closed doors. Even as some Democrats remain tight-lipped about their concern about the president’s electability, many have openly noted that this week’s NATO summit comes with added pressure given the looming reelection doubts. The summit presents a timely example of Democrats’ heightened anxieties about losing to Trump in November. The former president has said he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the 32-member military alliance if he won a second term. “Americans, they know we’re stronger with our friends and we understand this is a sacred obligation,” Biden said during his NATO speech. Since his June 27 debate fumble, Biden has held several public appearances to try and restore confidence in his candidacy, including a 22-minute interview with ABC News last Friday. So far, his public showings have not put Democrats’ worries to rest. “The president needs to engage in the kind of interaction with voters that will prove to those that are skeptical out there that he can do the job,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a Sunday broadcast interview about the week ahead. “If he can’t do that, then he has a decision to make.” Biden is scheduled to hold a solo press conference on Thursday evening, a highly anticipated opportunity for him to prove that he can carry on an exchange with reporters in an unscripted environment.

Iran has voted in a reformist president — but change remains distant,"Iran just elected its first reformist president in two decades. What’s next?        Ali Rogin Harry Zahn Leave your feedback Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian will ascend to the Iranian presidency in a delicate moment for the Islamic Republic, both on the world stage and within its borders. He faces a government still largely controlled by hard-line clerics, tension with the West over Iran’s nuclear program and domestic frustrations with the regime. Ali Rogin speaks with Suzanne Maloney at the Brookings Institution for more. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Lisa Desjardins: Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian will ascend to the Iranian presidency in a delicate moment for the Islamic Republic, both on the world stage and within its borders. He faces a government still largely controlled by hardline clerics tension with the West over Iran's nuclear program and domestic frustrations with the regime. Ali Rogin has more. Ali Rogin: To discuss what this means for Iran, the U.S. and other stakeholders. I'm joined by Suzanne Maloney. She's the Vice President and Director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. Suzanne, thank you so much for being here. Tell us a little bit more about Masoud Pezeshkian? What did he campaign on? Suzanne Maloney, Brookings Institute: Masoud Pezeshkian is a 70-year-old longtime member of the parliament who served also as the health minister during the second administration of President Mohammad Khatami, who was Iran's first reformist president. He has kept a relatively low profile. Up until this campaign, he did register previous rounds of Iranian elections back in 2013. And then again in 2021, when he was in fact prohibited from running by the Guardians Council, which vets all the candidates. This time around, it was a little bit of a surprise that he made it through in part because he wasn't terribly well known. But of course, all of the elements about this election were very improvisational, because it came in the wake of the unexpected death of the prior president, Ebrahim Raisi. Ali Rogin: And Pezeshkian had fashioned himself a reformer, what sort of campaign did he run? What kind of message was he putting out there? Suzanne Maloney: Well Pezeshkian is a longtime member of the Reformist Party that has largely fallen out of favor due to the fact that President Khatami its standard bearer, and others were really unable to affect meaningful change for the Iranian people. And yet it has remained a part of the Iranian political system and Pezeshkian when he was selected to run title his came, Baraye Iran or For Iran, it was really meant, I think, to talk about the theme of Pezeshkian's campaign, one of being pro Iran, very much nondisruptive very much in favor of the current clerical lead system, but one in which he wanted to see Iran, more engaged with the world and less confrontational and hostile to the world. Ali Rogin: Iranian officials have long pointed to relatively high turnout levels in Iranian elections as a sign of legitimacy behind the regime. But this time around, there were two rounds of voting, and both of them had relatively low turnout numbers compared to previous years. What does this year's turnout say about the feelings among the Iranian voting public? Suzanne Maloney: I think it's been clear for many years that much of the population is incredibly disenchanted with the Islamic Republic and the clerical theocratic regime that runs Iran, but they haven't really had a way to demonstrate that dissatisfaction. The fact that only 40 percent turned out in the first round of this election was really a startling number. In past elections, it's run as high as 70 and 80 percent of the voting population that has in fact voted, in part because there are requirements for individuals to vote. And so there's so many risks that requirement to stay at home was a real concern for the regime. And I think it was part of the reason why the election went to a runoff and in fact, why the clerical establishment is quite happy to have someone like Pezeshkian in this position now. Ali Rogin: Where does this deep frustration with Iran's ruling class come from? And how might the presidency of Pezeshkian impact that? Suzanne Maloney: Well, Iran has an incredibly young population, most of the population has been born not just since the revolution, but since the end of the Iran Iraq war in 1988. And they have seen various attempts to try to normalize the regime, varied efforts to try to promote some real liberalization of both politics and society, as well as some expansion of Iran's ties with the world. But none have really succeeded in part because of the very hardline stance of Iran's ultimate authority, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. And so they become very disgruntled, very much disillusioned with even the modest efforts of the system to try to give them some kind of political participation. They've also been very dissatisfied with the state of the economy, which has been subject to both very heavy American sanctions, but also to considerable mismanagement by the clerical system. It's really unclear that Pezeshkian's presidency will make a meaningful difference. He is someone who's quite loyal to the system itself. But he will bring about a kinder, gentler Islamic Republic to some extent, and that at a time of considerable tensions on the regional scene, and considerable dissatisfaction at home might just be a benefit for both the population and for the leadership. Ali Rogin: There is, of course, the Iranian nuclear program, which is the source of so much tension between Iran and the West and of course, rising tensions with Israel that we've seen play out since the October 7 attack. How do you think this election may affect Iran's approach to all of those issues? Suzanne Maloney: I expect the Pezeshkian election will have very little impact on Iran's foreign or regional policies, he will have limited bandwidth, or engagement with the nucleophile. The same is true for Iran's relationships with its proxies across the region. It is possible though that Pezeshkian can inject a note of caution a note of prudence, which seems to have been both his style and his message on the campaign trail. Ali Rogin: Suzanne Maloney with the Brookings Institution thank you so much for joining us. Suzanne Maloney: Thank you.

French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to tender resignation,"French president accepts prime minister's resignation but keeps him as head of caretaker government          PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron accepted the prime minister’s resignation Tuesday but kept him on as head of a caretaker government, as France prepares to host the Paris Olympics at the end of the month. The president’s office said in a statement that Macron “accepted” the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and other ministers on Tuesday. Attal and other government members are “to handle current affairs until a new government is being appointed,” the statement said. There is no firm timeline for when Macron must name a new prime minister, following parliamentary elections this month that left the National Assembly with no dominant political bloc in power for the first time in France’s modern Republic. The caretaker government led by Attal will focus only on handling day-to-day affairs. “For this period to end as quickly as possible, it is up to all Republican forces to work together” around “projects and actions that serve the French people,” the president’s statement said. The opening session of the National Assembly, France’s powerful lower house of parliament, is scheduled for Thursday. Normally, members of government are barred from being lawmakers, but Tuesday’s move allows Attal to take up his seat as a lawmaker and lead the group of Macron’s centrist allies in the National Assembly. It also insulates him from a no-confidence vote, because he already has resigned and a caretaker government cannot be subject to such a vote. France has been on the brink of government paralysis since elections for the National Assembly earlier this month resulted in a split among three major political groupings: the New Popular Front leftist coalition, Macron’s centrist allies and the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. The New Popular Front won the most seats but fell well short of the outright majority needed to govern on its own. The leftist coalition’s three main parties, the hard-left France Unbowed, the Socialists and the Greens, have urged the president to turn to them to form the new government, yet their internal talks have turned into a harsh dispute over whom to choose as prime minister. France Unbowed suspended the talks on Monday, accusing the Socialists of sabotaging candidacies they have put forward to replace Attal. Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure said Tuesday the leftist coalition needs “to think, talk and resume discussions” if it wants to meet “the expectation of the public” and fulfill its promise that it “is ready to govern.” Faure acknowledged that lengthy discussions, public bickering and occasional angry verbal exchanges among the coalition’s party leaders are “not a good look.” But “the stakes are so high that it’s not unusual for us to talk for a long time and that sometimes, we yell,” Faure said on France Inter radio. National Rally vice president Sebastien Chenu said the quarreling on the left is a sign that the New Popular Front “is not ready to govern.” He also lashed out at Macron on Tuesday, saying the retention of Attal at the helm of government following two recent elections — for the European Parliament and the National Assembly -- was “a denial of democracy.” Keeping him on to manage “current affairs” amounts to “failing” the French people, Chenu said in an interview with Europe 1 and CNews broadcasters. “We cannot make something new out of something old,” Chenu said. “Attal must pack his bags, he and all his ministers.” Politicians from the three main groups are also waging a battle over the presidency and key committees in the National Assembly, France’s influential lower house of parliament. Manuel Bompard, a lawmaker of the France Unbowed said he supported the idea of blocking lawmakers from Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally from holding leading positions in the parliament’s committees, such as finance, defense and others. Despite Le Pen’s party finishing third in the elections, behind Macron’s group of centrists and the leftist alliance, Bompard said in an interview with France 2 TV that there is “no reason for us to help them access positions of responsibility.” Le Pen, a leading figure in the French far right and a National Rally lawmaker, insisted that “all political forces must participate in the functioning” of the parliament. “The people have spoken. There are 577 lawmakers who represent them,” Le Pen said in a post on X. “Even if I am the last one to defend democracy, I insist that the Macronists, the New Popular Front, the National Rally and Eric Ciotti (a National Rally ally) must be represented in the legislative body,” she added.

‘A kind of civil war’: Divided France on alert for unrest amid political earthquake,"‘A kind of civil war’: Divided France on alert for unrest amid political earthquake                                                                                                                      “We’re scared of what might happen,” Amel, 34, told CNBC ahead of the final round of voting in France’s snap election this weekend. The vote is being closely watched by all quarters of French society to see if the nationalist, anti-immigration National Rally (RN) builds on its initial win in the first round of voting, or whether centrist and leftwing parties have been able to thwart the party’s chances of entering government. “It’s a very, very tense time. And it’s the first time that the far right is winning at the first turn [the first round of the ballot]. So it’s a very big deal,” Amel, a therapist who said she will vote for the leftwing New Popular Front, added. “We are very anxious and we are trying to get everyone to vote, trying to tell people who don’t vote to go and vote, and to try to convince people who vote for the extreme right that they are not a good answer [to France’s problems].” France’s far-right RN rejects the “extremist” label, saying it stands up for French values, culture and citizens at a time when many are fed up with France’s political establishment that’s been led by President Emmanuel Macron since 2017. But RN’s opponents and critics warn France is on the brink of a political catastrophe if an overtly anti-immigration, nationalist and euroskeptic party wins a majority in this snap election called by Macron after his party lost heavily against the hard-right in European Parliament elections in June. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has said French voters now have a “moral duty” to halt the party’s advance. For young, left-leaning voters like Amel, RN’s surge in voter polls, and the fact it won the most votes in the first round of the election last weekend, are worrying developments that make them fear for France’s societal cohesion. “I am worried about the country’s future. I think it’s getting worse and worse,” Amel, who preferred to only give her first name due to the sensitive nature of the situation, said. “It’s going be like a kind of civil war. I hope it will not reach that, but people will just not mix anymore and will be scared of each other. And this is very scary.” The snap election has thrown the country’s political polarization into sharp relief as polls ahead of the final round of voting on Sunday imply a deeply divided nation. The first round of the election resulted in the far-right RN winning 33% of the vote, with the leftwing New Popular Front (NFP) garnering 28% and the coalition of parties supporting Macron (Ensemble, or Together) winning 20% of the vote. Since the results of the first ballot, parties on the center-right and left have gone all-out to prevent RN’s advance in the second ballot, aiming to prevent a parliamentary majority for the party at all costs. Joining forces in a so-called “Republican Front,” centrists and leftwing parties have withdrawn candidates in many constituencies where one of their candidates was better placed to beat the RN. By offering voters a starker choice and fewer options, the anti far-right front hopes that the electorate will vote for the non-RN candidate. Whether it will work remains to be seen and analysts point out that French voters might not take kindly to being directed how to vote, or who to vote for. The final result on Sunday evening — the outcome of a snap election Macron did not need to call — will show just how hard it could be to find a consensus in national politics and government going forward. How the nation will react to the result is also uncertain. France is no stranger to civil unrest given the widespread “Yellow Vest” anti-government movement of recent years, and street protests since the first round of voting on June 30. France’s Interior Ministry appears to be preparing for more trouble after Sunday’s poll, reportedly ready to deploy around 30,000 officers across France on Sunday night amid fears of violence after polls close. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin is reported to have said 5,000 police would be on duty in Paris and its surrounding areas to “ensure that the radical right and radical left do not take advantage of the situation to cause mayhem.” France’s police force has, at times, been accused of being heavy-handed with demonstrators during previous periods of unrest, firing water cannon and tear gas at “yellow vest” demonstrators in 2019.  A member of the gendarmerie, France’s military force in charge of law enforcement and public order, told CNBC that the “French elections are a mess” and that the “public divide has rarely been so flagrant in France.” “People’s opinions are becoming more and more divided and this is felt in everyday life,” the gendarme, who asked to remain anonymous due to the nature of his job, told CNBC. The officer — a father of three who’s in his 40s, and a right-leaning voter — said the polarization in French society was “very worrying, but unfortunately normal with the ‘diversity’ of our society.” “More and more people with different values and educations are being forced to co-exist, and this clearly doesn’t work,” the officer, who works in Bordeaux in southwestern France, said. “I am worried about the country’s future, because we are too generous to people who aren’t willing to integrate and contribute to our society, this can not last.” The police officer said he expected civil unrest after the vote, whichever party gained the most votes. “There will be civil unrest whoever is elected, this is France and the people speak their mind.” Political experts agree that the current febrile atmosphere of French politics, and antagonism between the main bodies of voters, are the ingredients for further civil unrest. “You’ve got here all the recipe for a super-polarized political scene and that, of course, translates into civil society as a whole,” Philippe Marlière, professor of French and European politics at University College London, told CNBC. “If you’ve got only 33-34% of people voting for the far-right it means the rest is wary of that, or completely opposed to it, so that will translate on every level of politics — institutional politics, party politics, the National Assembly, but also in society. You will have a very polarized society in which younger people, ethnic minorities, women, and in particular feminists, would be very worried,” he said. Marlière did not discount the possibility of violence on the streets if a far-right party was elected to government. “We’re not there yet. But if there are very unpopular, very antagonizing and very hostile policies to some groups, there will be demonstrations on a scale that you have unrest in the street,” he said. Like other hard-right parties in Europe, the National Rally has tapped into voter insecurities regarding crime, immigration, national identity and economic insecurity. RN’s 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella has told voters he will “restore order,” curb immigration and tackle delinquency but he and party figurehead Marine Le Pen have rowed back on some of their more strident promises and rhetoric, back-pedaling over taking France out of NATO, for example, and moderating the party’s traditionally pro-Russian stance. Bardella said he would still support the sending of arms to Ukraine but not the deployment of ground troops, as Macron suggested was a possibility. It’s uncertain how many of National Rally’s policies would be enacted even if the party made it into government. The “Republican Front” also appears confident ahead of the second round of voting that its strategy to hurt the RN’s vote share is working. An opinion poll published by Ifop on July 3 suggested voters might tend toward a centrist pro-Macron or leftwing candidate rather than the RN candidate if that is the choice they are presented with on the ballot paper on Sunday. If the choice was between a far-left and far-right candidate, however, the picture was more nuanced, showing a split vote. Analysts predict that RN is less likely to be able to achieve an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, but is still likely to gather the most votes, creating a hung parliament scenario and headache for Macron and uncertainty for France’s political and economic outlook. “The political landscape is in turmoil and can’t really work any longer, at least not by the old rules,” Ipsos analyst Mathieu Doiret told CNBC Thursday. “We are in a situation so far from our traditions and political habitus that it’s very difficult to adapt to this new situation for every stakeholder.” Got a confidential news tip?

Iran elects reformist Masoud Pezeshkian in presidential runoff vote,"2017 Iranian presidential election   Hassan Rouhani MDP Hassan Rouhani MDP Presidential elections were held in Iran on 19 May 2017, the twelfth of such elections. Local elections were held simultaneously. Candidate registration took place from 11 to 15 April 2017. Incumbent president Hassan Rouhani was eligible to run for re-election. His rivals were the conservatives' top candidate Ebrahim Raisi, the Islamic Coalition Party's Mostafa Mir-Salim and Mostafa Hashemitaba who ran with no partisan support.[1] Rouhani was re-elected for a second term. According to results announced by the Interior Ministry, Rouhani received 59% of the vote, while his closest rival Ebrahim Raisi received 39%. Rouhani was re-inaugurated on 5 August 2017 taking the oath of office for the second time at the Parliament of Iran. The president of Iran is elected using the two-round system. To win in the first round, a candidate must receive more than 50% of all votes cast (both valid and invalid).[2] Any Iranian citizen above 18 years of age was able to register as a presidential candidate. An institution called the Election Monitoring Agency (EMA) and managed by the Guardian Council vets registered candidates and approves a handful to run in the election. The Guardian Council does not publicly announce the reason a particular candidate is rejected, although those reasons are explained to each candidate. Women who register as candidates have invariably been excluded from standing for election by the Council.[3][4] According to the official dates announced on 1 April 2017 by the Ministry of Interior:[5] During the five days period, a total of 1,636 individuals put their name to run for president, an increase over the 686 candidates in the previous election in 2013. Among the candidates was a record number of 137 women.[6] Hundreds of the applicants were ordinary people with no political background[7] and clearly lacked the criteria cited in the article 115 of the constitution, which is being considered among ""religious and political rejal"" (""men"" or ""personalities"", according to different interpretations).[8] Many criticized the law, which allows almost anyone to register to run.[6] Some intended to gain public attention, including political prisoners Mehdi Khazali and former MP Ghasem Sholeh-Saadi,a millionaire property developer applied from Australia Alireza Ahmadian[9] and some women tried to challenge the judicial interpretation of word rejal as ""men"", most notably Azam Taleghani.[6][9] On 20 April 2017 the Guardian Council announced a list of 6 approved candidates. The list contains incumbent president Hassan Rouhani, incumbent vice president Eshaq Jahangiri, Astan Quds Razavi custodian Ebrahim Raisi, Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Mostafa Mir-Salim and Mostafa Hashemitaba.[citation needed] Former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his vice president Hamid Baghaei were disqualified.[10] Ahmadinejad, who was advised by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei not to run for the election,[11] wrote a letter in September 2016 to him, pledging that he would not run.[12] On 11 February 2017, he officially declared that he would not back any candidate, however, in a video released on 19 March 2017 he announced his support for Hamid Baghaei[13] and surprised observers by himself registering to run.[14] Mohammad Gharazi was also among those disqualified, despite being approved as a candidate in 2013.[15] In his statement, Ghalibaf accused current president Hassan Rouhani of financial mismanagement and asserted that he and his supporters were ""revolutionary opportunists.""[17] The statement read: The fight against pseudo-revolutionary opportunists has become highly costly, because this current is gnawing at the roots of the Revolution like a termite...[They] are not only at odds with the intellectual fundaments of original revolutionaries, but also represent a current whose material interests are at risk.[18] Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) provides each candidate with 210 minutes for campaign talks on TV,[20] and there would be three debate sessions on politics, economics, and social pressing issues aired on Channel 1.[21] On 20 April 2017, Election Campaign Monitoring Commission announced that there would be no live debates and it will broadcast prerecorded,[22] however, after vast criticism from candidates and Iranian people the commission revoked its decision two days later.[23] Candidates are scheduled to air dedicated programmes on IRIB TV channels and radio stations, 555 minutes for each per candidate, and a sum of 1,470 minutes including the debates.[24] The election was characterised for usage of populist practices[25][26] and mudslinging.[27] The conservatives launched smear campaigns against the reformist-backed candidate Hassan Rouhani,[1][25] while he initially refrained from campaigning in this way. Rouhani later changed strategy by simply attacking his rivals[28] and the incumbent administration used fearmongering tactics to encourage people to vote.[29] Social media was traditionally a tool for the reformists to campaign, but the presence of conservatives during the election was unprecedented in Iranian political history.[30] Telegram instant messaging service, the most widely used messaging application in Iran, reportedly has more than 45 million users in a country of nearly 80 million as of April 2016.[31] It serves as a platform for Iranians to express their political opinions[32] and played an important role in the campaigns for the elections held in 2016 for Parliament and Assembly of Experts.[33] Twitter is blocked in Iran, however, Iranians use proxies to tweet and those that create a buzz, then travel to Telegram channels, where ""they can potentially reach a much wider audience"" according to BBC.[34] Two months before election, Iranian Judiciary arrested some pro-Hassan Rouhani Telegram channel administrators for “crimes against public morals and publishing obscenity”.[31] The campaigners also heavily used Instagram[34] and its feature of airing live videos to stream real-time campaign developments.[35] Rouhani and I are side-by-side. President Rouhani's ally and first vice president Eshaq Jahangiri stood in the election to support him during the campaign and in TV debates,[37] being called as a ‘fender’ or ‘cover candidate’ by Iranian media,[38] who will possibly withdraw in support of the incumbent president.[39] The idea was allegedly recommended by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani,[38] who was a key backer of Rouhani before his death in January 2017.[37] Another reason cited for the nomination was to have an 'alternative candidate' in case the Guardian Council disqualified Rouhani[40] or raise his profile for a bid in 2021 election.[36] Jahangiri withdrew in favor of Rouhani on 16 May 2017.[citation needed] Candidate Mostafa Hashemitaba released a statement on 15 May 2017 and endorsed Rouhani, but refused to quit the race. He said he “will vote for the current president to help extension of this government's constructive approach.”[41] Among the approved candidates, Ebrahim Raisi, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and Mostafa Mir-Salim were regarded as figures of the conservative camp, which intended to bring one single candidate for the election.[42] Popular Front of Islamic Revolution Forces (JAMNA), the umbrella organization established to introduce one single consensus candidate for the conservatives finally endorsed both Raisi and Ghalibaf,[1] and it was unclear if any of them would drop out in favor of a fellow conservative.[43] On 15 May 2017, Ghalibaf gave up his bid in favor of Raisi.[16] Islamic Coalition Party released a statement on 18 May 2017, announcing it supports Raisi's bid for presidency following the withdrawal of Mostafa Mir-Salim,[44] despite the fact that Mir-Salim denied that he is withdrawing from the race.[45] Voting started at 08:00 on Friday, 29 May 2017 and took place at 63,429 polling stations across Iran, as well as around 14,000 mobile ballot boxes. It involved around 1.5 million executive forces and monitors, 350,000 security forces, 70,000 inspectors, and around 100,000 representatives of local governors.[84] After a ""huge rush"" of citizens to vote,[85] the polling time was extended for several extra hours until midnight which is the latest possible time allowed by the law.[86] Among the citizens eligible to vote in the election, about 2.5 million lived abroad and the elections were held in 103 countries, including the United States.[87] Canada, which hosts at least 400,000 Iranians,[87] does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, a situation which hindered participation of Iranian citizens.[88] However, some traveled to the United States in order to vote.[89] During the elections, several Iranian analysts and officials warned of a possible foreign electoral intervention. The head of Iran's judicial system, Sadeq Larijani, warned that Iran's enemies made a ""huge investment"" to undermine and exploit the elections: ""The enemies may want to deal a blow to the Iranian political system during the elections"".[90] On 20 April 2017 Rustam Minnikhanov - President of Tatarstan and Vladimir Putin's envoy, met with candidate Ebrahim Raisi in Mashhad in Raisi's capacity as Head of Astan Quds Razavi. MP Alireza Rahimi questioned the meeting and asked for explanations about the reasons for it, citing alleged Russian interference in 2016 U.S. election. “The recent meeting raises the suspicion of interference in the elections, which is not appropriate”, he said.[91][92] According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, Minnikhanov also met vice president Eshaq Jahangiri in Tehran one day earlier, discussing bilateral relations.[93] According to final results, 41,366,085 voted from a registered electorate of 56,410,234. Turnout was 73.33%. The Ministry of Interior announced results gradually after midnight (local time), after polls closed. Final results were announced on 8 June 2017.[94] The table below displays the official vote tallies by province: The table below displays the official vote tallies by country:  Tens of thousands of supporters of President Hassan Rouhani poured into the streets of Tehran to celebrate the incumbent's re-election.[95] The Tehran Stock Exchange rallied after the election results came out, extending a recent winning streak to close almost 1% higher at its highest level in three months.[96] On 21 May 2017, Ebrahim Raisi wrote a letter to the Guardian Council, objecting to the results.[97] Media related to Iranian presidential election, 2017 at Wikimedia Commons","""What is the name of the candidate who won the Iranian presidential runoff vote in 2017?""",True,False,True

"""Psilocybin permanently strengthens brain networks""","Psilocybin desynchronizes brain networks  An official website of the United States government   Preview improvements coming to the PMC website in October 2024. Learn More or Try it out now. The relationship between the acute effects of psychedelics and their persisting neurobiological and psychological effects is poorly understood. Here, we tracked brain changes with longitudinal precision functional mapping in healthy adults before, during, and for up to 3 weeks after oral psilocybin and methylphenidate (17 MRI visits per participant) and again 6+ months later. Psilocybin disrupted connectivity across cortical networks and subcortical structures, producing more than 3-fold greater acute changes in functional networks than methylphenidate. These changes were driven by desynchronization of brain activity across spatial scales (area, network, whole brain). Psilocybin-driven desynchronization was observed across association cortex but strongest in the default mode network (DMN), which is connected to the anterior hippocampus and thought to create our sense of self. Performing a perceptual task reduced psilocybin-induced network changes, suggesting a neurobiological basis for grounding, connecting with physical reality during psychedelic therapy. The acute brain effects of psilocybin are consistent with distortions of space-time and the self. Psilocybin induced persistent decrease in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and cortex (and DMN in particular), lasting for weeks but normalizing after 6 months. Persistent suppression of hippocampal-DMN connectivity represents a candidate neuroanatomical and mechanistic correlate for psilocybin’s pro-plasticity and anti-depressant effects. Psychedelic drugs can reliably induce powerful changes in the perception of self, time and space via agonism of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A receptor)1,2. In clinical trials, a single high dose of psilocybin has demonstrates immediate and sustained symptom relief in depression3–8, and addiction9. Taken together, these two observations suggest that psychedelics should have distinct neurobiological signatures corresponding to acute (intoxication) and persisting (after the drug has been eliminated from the body) phases. Acute effects of psilocybin include increase in glucose metabolism in frontal and medial temporal cortex10,11. EEG and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies of acute psychedelic effects have reported decreased signal power12,13 and functional connectivity (FC) with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), and LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) broadly across the cortex. These seemingly paradoxical observations of increased metabolism and decreased signal power are not understood. Persisting effects of psychedelics include increase in the expression of genes that contribute to synaptic plasticity14,15, and increase in growth of neurites and synapses in vitro16, and in vivo17–19. Network-level correlates of persisting psilocybin effects remain unknown in humans. Rodent models have suggested that the burst of plasticity in the medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus may be key to psilocybin’s antidepressant effects16,17,20. The medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus form core part of the default mode network21 and increased cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms22. Precision functional mapping (PFM) utilizes dense repeated rsfMRI sampling23–25 to reveal the timecourses of individual-specific intervention-driven brain connectivity changes26. The PFM approach takes advantage of the high variability in brain networks across individuals and high stability within individuals24. We applied the PFM approach to detail the individual-specific acute and persistent effects of a single high dose of psilocybin (25mg). Healthy young adults received psilocybin (PSIL) and methylphenidate (MTP, generic Ritalin, dose-matched for arousal effects) on different days and underwent regular MRI sessions (~18 per participant) each before, during, between, and after the two drug doses (Fig. S1A). Dense pre-drug sampling familiarized participants with the scanner and establish baseline variability. We found that psilocybin produced changes in brain network structure that far exceeded those induced by other state changes such as treatment with methylphenidate, or an auditory-visual task. Interrogation of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal revealed that the highly conserved spatial structure of resting BOLD fluctuations was dramatically altered by psilocybin. Finally, we identified a change in hippocampal-cortical connectivity that persisted for weeks after psilocybin and had normalized by the time participants returned for additional open label psilocybin doses 6+ months later. Psilocybin acutely caused profound and widespread brain network changes (Figs. 1a, S2, S3), greater than 3x larger than the effects of methylphenidate or other manipulations (task engagement = 1.30, methylphenidate = 1.51, high head motion = 1.46, psilocybin = 4.58, between person = 4.58). To put psilocybin’s effects in perspective, it helps to consider that the differences in an individuals’ brain organization on/off drug were as large as those between different persons (Fig. 1b). Brain-wide connectivity change (Euclidian distance) was calculated across the cortex and subcortical structures and effects of condition were determined with a linear mixed effects (LME) model. a) Top: psilocybin-associated network change (LME model, t-statistic). Middle: methylphenidate-associated network stimulant. Bottom: day to day FC variability (random effect of day). b) Whole Brain network change magnitude (Euclidian distance between brain-wide connectivity matrices) reveals that psilocybin produces much larger change than methylphenidate, closer in magnitude to between person differences. Vertical bars and asterisks indicate significance (p<0.05) for post-hoc t-test between conditions. c) Change by system (resting-state network), based on individualized Infomap parcellation. Open circles represent individual subjects, bars represent average magnitude. *Disruption was significantly enriched within the default mode network based on rotation permutation testing. d) Psilocybin Network Change across the bilateral hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (same color scale as panel a). In the cortex, psilocybin-associated changes localized to association networks. To assess resting state networks (RSNs, referred to here as ‘systems’) specificity, we ran a community detection algorithm on each participant and then compared network change between system, using a rotation-based null model27. Psilocybin-associated change was greatest in the default mode networks (Fig. 1c). By contrast, network changes associated with methylphenidate consistently localized to motor and action communities (Fig. S3). Individual-specific psilocybin-induced brain changes were consistent when participants returned 6 months later for a second psilocybin dose (correlation between change maps; r=0.67) (Fig. S2). In subcortex, the largest psilocybin-associated network changes were seen in DMN-connected parts of the thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and hippocampus (Fig. 1d)21,28,29. In the hippocampus, foci of strong FC disruption were in the anterior hippocampus (MNI: −24, −22,16 and 24, −18,16). In the basal ganglia, the largest FC disruptions were seen in mediodorsal (MD) thalamus and anteromedial caudate. In the cerebellum the largest FC disruptions were seen in the DMN29. To examine the latent dimensions of variability in brain networks across participant, drug condition, and task, we performed multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) on brain networks from every session24. Dimension 1 (Dim1), the dimension which explained the largest amount of variability across the dataset, largely separated psilocybin from other scans (Fig. 2a), apart from one session where the participant (P5R) vomited 30 minutes after taking the psilocybin dose and was not re-dosed (red dots on the left of Fig. 2a). The higher score on Dim1 associated with psilocybin, corresponded to reduced segregation between default mode, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and cingulo-opercular network – systems that are normally anticorrelated 30(Figs. 2c and S5). Subtraction of average FC during psilocybin minus baseline revealed a similar pattern of FC change (Fig. S5). To determine if this reflects a common effect of psilocybin that generalized across dataset and psychedelics, we calculated Dim1 scores for extant datasets from participants receiving I.V. psilocybin31 and LSD32. Psychedelic increased Dim1 in nearly every participant in the LSD and psilocybin datasets (Fig. 2d). In the scatter plots, each point represents the functional network from a single scan, plotted in a multidimensional space based on the similarity between scans. Replication scans are represented with open circles. a) Dimensions 1 and 4 are plotted for every 15-minute scan. In the top panel, points are colored based on drug condition. In the bottom panel, points are colored based on participant identity. Dimension 1 separates psilocybin from non-drug and MTP scans in most cases. Dimension 4 separates individuals in most cases and shows a small but significant before/after effect. C) Visualization of dimension 1 weights (top 1% of edges are projected onto the brain to show the connections most effected by psilocybin). D) In additional datasets with LSD (top) and psilocybin (bottom), psychedelic causes reliable change along dimension 1. By comparison, methylphenidate produced a decrease in connectivity between regions in the sensory, motor, and auditory networks (Fig. S5b), consistent with previous reports33 and similar to the effect of caffeine25. To verify that observations in our sample (N = 7) were generalizable, we compared our study’s stimulant effects to those in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study34 (n = 487 taking stimulants). The main effect of stimulant use on FC in ABCD was consistent with methylphenidate-associated FC changes in our dataset (Fig. S5b). To investigate how psilocybin-driven network changes are influenced by task states, participants were asked to complete a simple auditory-visual matching task in the scanner. Participants performed this task with high accuracy during drug sessions (Fig. S4). Engagement in the task significantly decreased the magnitude of psilocybin-associated network disruption by 43% (change (psilocybin + rest) = 4.58; change (psilocybin + task) = 2.59; unpaired t-test, P = 0.0041; Figs. 1b & S3c), suggesting that psilocybin’s acute effects on brain networks may be context dependent. The reduction of psilocybin-driven brain changes parallels the psychological principle of ‘grounding’ – directing one’s attention on sensory perception as a means of alleviating intense or distressing thoughts or emotions – which is commonly employed in psychedelic-associated psychotherapy35. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of context-dependent effects of psilocybin on functional connectivity and fills an important gap between preclinical studies of context dependence36,37 and clinical observations38. Evoked responses during the auditory-visual matching task were largely unchanged during psilocybin, suggesting that altered neurovascular uncoupling is unlikely to account for observed FC change (Fig. S4). We observed that the normally stable spatial structure of resting fMRI fluctuations was disrupted by psilocybin, making the FC desynchronized and disorganized (see video supplement). We measured synchrony of brain signals using Normalized Global Spatial Complexity (NGSC) – a measure of spatial entropy that is independent of the number of signals39. NGSC calculates cumulative variance explained by subsequent spatiotemporal patterns (Fig. 3a). The lowest value of NGSC=0 means that the timecourse for vertex/voxel is identical. The highest value of NGSC=1 means that the timecourse for every vertex/voxel is independent – indicating maximal desynchronization (or spatial entropy). a) normalized global spatial complexity (NGSC) captures the ‘complexity’ of brain activity patterns. It is derived from the number of spatial principal components (PCs) used to explain the data. Higher entropy = less desynchronized activity. b) Whole-brain entropy (NGSC) is shown for every fMRI scan for a single participant (P6). Psilocybin scans are shown in red. At right, increases during psilocybin were present in all participants (box and whiskers indicate quartiles and 99.7th percentiles for non-drug scans, red circles indicate psilocybin) c) Entropy within functional brain areas shown similar increases. d) Spatial entropy is visualized on the cortical surface. Psilocybin-associated increase in entropy was largest in association cortices. This was replicated in LSD data (middle; using data from Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) and corresponds spatially to 5ht2A binding density (bottom; borrowed with permission from Beliveau et al., 2017). Psilocybin significantly increased NGSC (mixed effects model with individual differences and head motion as random effects, p = 9.2e-7), with levels returning to pre-drug baseline by the following session (Fig. 3b- d). The increase in NGSC was observed at whole-brain and individual brain area levels (Fig. 3c, d), with the largest increases in association cortex and minimal chance in primary cortex (Fig. 3d). Global and local desynchronization replicated in an LSD dataset (Fig. 3d)32 and the distribution of these effects closely matched PET-based maps of 5HT-2A receptor density (Fig. 3e)40. To assess if persistent neurotrophic and psychological effects of psychedelics might be reflected in network changes weeks after psilocybin, we assessed network changes 1–21 days post-psilocybin (compared to pre-drug). Whole brain network change scores were small, and not significantly different from day-to-day variability, indicating that the brain’s structure had mostly returned to baseline (Fig. S2 and S3). The anterior hippocampus forms part of the default mode network21 and atypical cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms22. The same region of the anterior hippocampus which showed strong acute FC changes with psilocybin showed persistent connectivity alterations in the three weeks post-drug period (Fig. 4a and Supplemental figure 7). This persistent suppression of FC between the anterior hippocampus and cortex was found in all participants (Fig. 4b; LME model testing change in RMS AntHippo-cortical FC with head motion as a random effect: p = 5.1e-5). a) Group network change (relative to baseline) t-maps, left hippocampus: top=acute psilocybin, bottom = persisting (2 weeks after psilocybin. b) All subjects demonstrated a weakening of anterior hippocampal-cortical FC post-psilocybin (p=5.1e-5; linear mixed effects model accounting for head motion and subject ID). c) Connectivity from an anterior hippocampus seedmap at baseline, post-psilocybin and change for an exemplar (P3). The red border on the right-most brain illustrates individual-defined default mode network. A decrease in hippocampal FC with parietal and frontal components of the DMN is seen. d) Timecourse of anterior hippocampus - DMN for all participants/scans (participant colors as in panel b). A moving average is shown in black. e) schematic of hippocampal-cortical circuits, borrowed from Zheng et al., 2021. As predicted based on typical connectivity patterns, FC between the anterior hippocampus and DMN was decreased after psilocybin (Fig. 4c- e). Timecourse visualization, after aligning psilocybin doses between subjects, suggests that connectivity is reduced for 3 weeks after psilocybin but returned to pre-drug by 6–12-month replication scans (Fig. 4d). This observation is compelling, as it localized to the anterior hippocampus, a brain region shown to demonstrate substantial synaptogenesis following psilocybin18. Reduced hippocampal-cortical FC may reflect increased flexibility of self-oriented hippocampal circuits. The synchronized patterns of co-activation in the resting brain are believed to reflect the brain’s perpetual job of modeling reality41. It follows that the stability of synchronized brain networks across day, task, methylphenidate, and arousal levels (but not between individuals), reflects the subjective stability of waking consciousness. By contrast, the much larger changes induced by psilocybin fit with participants’ subjective report of a radical change in consciousness. The large magnitude of psilocybin’s effects, in comparison to methylphenidate, suggests that observed changes are not merely a consequence of changes in arousal or a nonspecific effect of monoaminergic stimulation42. Multi-unit recording studies suggest that agonism of 5HT2A receptors by psychedelics does not uniformly increase or decrease firing of pyramidal neurons, but rather serves to desynchronize pairs or populations of neurons which co-activate under normal conditions43. We observed a parallel phenomenon at the region, and whole brain level. This may explain the paradoxical effects of psychedelic seen in PET FDG and fMRI: disruption of synchronized activity should produce a decrease in power of local fluctuations12,13, despite an increase in metabolic activity, and a loss of the brain’s segregated network structure32,44. This desynchronization of neural activity has been described as an increase in entropy or randomness of brain activity in the psychedelic state45,46 (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), and it has been hypothesized to underly the cognitive and perception changes associated with psychedelics. The dramatic departure from normal synchronized patterns of co-activation may be key not only to understanding psilocybin’s acute effects, but also its persistent neurotrophic effects. Changes in resting BOLD activity are linked to shifts in glutamate-dependent signaling during psilocybin47,48. This phenomenon, shared by ketamine and psychedelics, engages homeostatic plasticity mechanisms49 - a neurobiological response to large deviations in typical network activity patterns50–52. This response to novelty includes rapid upregulation in expression of BDNF, mTOR, EF2 and other plasticity-related immediate early genes15,48. Consistent with this notion, psilocybin produced the largest changes in the fronto-parietal and default mode network, brain systems frequently associated with neuropsychiatric disorders53. Psychedelics rapidly induce plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex and this appears to be necessary for rapid antidepressant-like effects in animal models. However, to understand the underpinnings of psychedelics’ unique effects, it is necessary to study the human brain. Advances in precision functional mapping and individual-level characterization enabled us to identify desynchronization of resting state fMRI signals and localize these changes to depression-relevant circuits. Novel methods to measure neurotrophic markers in the human brain54 will provide a critical link between mechanistic observations at the cellular, brain-systems and psychological levels. Such links will help answer fundamental questions about the diagnosis and treatment of conditions of psychiatric illness. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and procedures established by the Washington University in Saint Louis Institutional Review Board. All participants were compensated for their time. All aspects of this study were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) Internal Review Board, the Washington University Human Research Protection Office (WU HRPO), the Federal Drug Administration (IND: 202002165) and the Missouri Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) under a federal DEA schedule 1 research license and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04501653). Psilocybin was supplied by Usona Institute via Almac Clinical Services. Healthy young adults (N=7, 18–45 years) were enrolled in a randomized cross-over precision functional brain mapping study to evaluate differences in individual-level connectomics pre-, during, and post- psilocybin exposure. Participants underwent imaging during drug sessions with psilocybin (PSIL) 25mg, or methylphenidate (MTP) 40mg as well as non-drug imaging sessions. Drug condition categories were 1) before psilocybin (‘Baseline’), 2) Drug 1( methylphenidate or psilocybin), 3) between, 4) Drug2 and 5) After. A minimum of 3 non-drug imaging sessions were completed during each non-drug window: before (baseline), between and after drug sessions. The number of non-drug MRI sessions was dependent on availability of the participant, scanner and scanner support staff. Dosing day imaging sessions were conducted 60–180 minutes following drug administration during peak blood concentration55. MTP was selected as the active control condition to simulate the cardiovascular effects and physiological arousal (i.e., controlling for dopaminergic effects) associated with psilocybin (Griffiths et al., 2006). Usona Institute, a United States non-profit medical research organization, provided good manufacturing practices (GMP) psilocybin. Drug sessions were facilitated by two clinical research staff who completed an approved in-person or online facilitator training program provided by Usona Institute, as part of Usona’s phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03866174). The role of the study facilitators was to build a therapeutic alliance with the participant throughout the study, prepare them for their drug dosing days, and to observe and maintain participant safety during dosing day visits35. The pair consisted of an experienced clinician (lead clinical facilitator) and a trainee (co-facilitator).  Participants were invited to return >6 months after completing the initial cross-over study for an open label psilocybin dose (which we refer to as ‘replication protocol). This included 1–2 baseline fMRIs, a psilocybin session (identical to initial session, except for blinding), and 1–2 “after” sessions within 4 days of the dose. Healthy adults ages 18 to 45 years were recruited via campus-wide advertisement and colleague referral. Participants were enrolled from March 2021 to May 2023. Participants were required to have had at least one previous lifetime psychedelic exposure (e.g., psilocybin, mescaline, ayahuasca, LSD), but no psychedelics exposure within the past 6 months. Individuals with psychiatric illness (depression, psychosis, addiction) based on DSM-5 were excluded. Participants were scanned roughly every other day over the course of the experiment (Fig. S1). Imaging was performed at a consistent time of day to minimize diurnal effects in functional connectivity 56. Neuroimaging was performed on a Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) in the neuroimaging labs (NIL) at the Washington University Medical Center. Structural scans (T1w and T2w) were acquired for each participant at 0.9 mm isotropic resolution, with real-time motion correction. Structural scans from different sessions were averaged together for the purposes of Freesurfer segmentation and nonlinear atlas registrations. To capture high resolution images of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, we used an echo-planar imaging sequence with 2mm isotropic voxels, multi-band 6, multi-echo 5 (TEs: 14.20 ms, 38.93 ms, 63.66 ms, 88.39 ms, 113.12 ms), TR 1761ms, flip angle = 68 degrees, and in-plane acceleration57 (IPAT/grappa) = 2. This sequence acquired 72 axial slices (144mm coverage). Each resting scan included 510 frames (lasting 15:49 minutes) as well as 3 frames at the end used to provide estimate electronic noise. Every session included two rest scans, totally 30-minute resting-state fMRI, during which participants were instructed to hold still and look at a white fixation crosshair presented on a black background. Head motion was tracked in real time using Framewise Integrated Real-time MRI Monitoring software (FIRMM)58. An eye-tracking camera (EyeLink, Ottawa) was used to monitor participants for drowsiness. Participants also completed a previously validated event-related fMRI task initially designed for the purposes of modeling hemodynamic responses in the auditory, visual, and motor cortices. Two task fMRI runs were completed during a subset of imaging sessions. Task fMRI runs employed the same sequence using in resting fMRI, included 48 trials (24 congruent, 24 incongruent), and lasted a total of 410s. See supplemental methods ‘Matching task’ fMRI for details. Resting fMRI data were preprocessed using a in-house processing pipeline. Briefly, this included alignment, normalization, non-linear registration, removal of thermal noise using NORDIC59, bandpass filtering, and scrubbing at a movement threshold of 0.3mm. Tissue-based regressors were computed in volume (white matter, ventricles, extra-axial CSF)60 and applied following projection to surface. Details on rsfMRI preprocessing are provided in supplemental methods.  Surface generation and processing of functional data followed procedures similar to Glasser and colleagues 201361. For cortical regions and resting state networks, we used a surface parcellation and community assignments generated by Gordon & Laumann and colleagues27. See supplemental methods for further details on surface generation and cortical parcellation. For subcortical regions, we used a set of regions of interest (Seitzman et al., 2020) generated to achieves full coverage and optimal region homogeneity. A subcortical limbic system was defined based on neuroanatomy: amygdala, antero-medial thalamus, nucleus accumbens, anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus62. These regions were expanded to cover fill anatomical structures (e.g. anterior hippocampus)63. To generate region-wise connectivity matrices, time courses of all surface vertices or subcortical voxels within a region were averaged. Functional connectivity (FC) was then computed between each region timeseries using Fisher z-transformed Pearson correlation.  We identified canonical large-scale networks using the individual-specific network matching approach described in previously27–29. Briefly, cortical surface and subcortical volume assignemtns was derived using the graph-theory-based Infomap algorithm64. In this approach, we calculated the Pearson correlation matrix from all cortical vertices and subcortical voxels, concatenated across all a participant’s scans. Correlations between vertices within 30 mm of each other were set to zero. The Infomap algorithm was applied to each subject’s correlation matrix thresholded at a range of edge densities spanning from 0.01% to 2%. At each threshold, the algorithm returned community identities for each vertex and voxel. Communities were labeled by matching them at each threshold to a set of independent group average networks described in Gordon et al. 2016. In each individual and in the average, a “consensus” network assignment was derived by collapsing assignments across thresholds, giving each node the assignment it had at the sparsest possible threshold at which it was successfully assigned to one of the known group networks. See supplementary figure S2 and S3 for individual and group mode assignments.  Network change (‘distance’) was calculated at the vertex level to generate network change maps (Fig. 1a- d, Fig. 4) and a linear mixed effects model with wild bootstrapping65,66 was used to generate statistics on these maps. First, a distance map was generated for every scan by computing, for each vertex, the average distance between its FC seedmap and the FC seedmap for each of that subject’s baseline scans. Second, distance maps for every scan were labeled on 5 dimensions: Subject ID, MRI session, task (task/rest), drug condition (baseline, PSIL, between, MTP, after, etc.), and head motion (average framewise displacement). Distance maps and associated conditions were then used to solve a linear mixed effects model in which drug condition and task were fixed effects, and Subject ID, MRI session, and head motion were random effects. Wild bootstrapping in combination with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was employed to estimate p-values for t-statistic maps resulting from the LME model. To perform the analysis, a wild bootstrapping procedure was implemented, which involved resampling clusters or groups of observations rather than individual data points. A large number of bootstrap samples (B=1,000) were generated using the Rademacher procedure66, where the residuals were randomly inverted to disrupt any potential autocorrelation. Specifically, a Rademacher vector was generated by randomly assigning −1 or 1 values with equal probability to each observation’s residual. By element-wise multiplication of the original residuals with the Rademacher vector, bootstrap samples were created to capture the variability in the data. For each bootstrap sample, the TFCE algorithm was applied to enhance the sensitivity to clusters of significant voxels or regions while controlling for multiple comparisons. The value of the enhanced cluster statistic, derived from the bootstrap samples, was used to create a null distribution under the null hypothesis. By comparing the original observed cluster statistic with the null distribution, p-values were derived to quantify the statistical significance of the observed effect. The p-values were obtained based on the proportion of bootstrap samples that produced a maximum cluster statistic exceeding the observed cluster statistic. Significance thresholds were determined using alpha = 0.05 to control for the family-wise error rate. The combined approach of wild bootstrapping with the Rademacher procedure and TFCE provided a robust and data-driven method to generate p-values for neuroimaging data. This methodology accounted for the complex correlation structure, effectively controlled for multiple comparisons, and accommodated potential autocorrelation in the residuals through the Rademacher procedure. By incorporating these techniques, significant effects of psilocybin and other conditions were reliably identified amidst noise and spatial dependencies.  For analyses in Figs. 1b, 2, S2, S3, distance calculations were computed at the parcel level. The effects of day-to-day, drug condition (baseline, psilocybin, between, MTP, after), task, and head motion and their interactions were directly examined by calculating the distance between each functional network matrix. RMS Euclidean distance was computed between the linearized upper triangles of the parcellated FC matrix between each pair of 15-minute fMRI scans, creating a second-order ‘‘distance” matrix (Fig. S2). In this analysis, the two task sessions were concatenated to match the length of the 15-minute rest runs. Subsequently, the average distance was examined for functional network matrices that were (1) from the same individual within a single session, (2) from the same individual across days (‘‘day-to-day”), (3) from the same subject between drug and baseline (e.g. ‘‘PSIL v Base”), (4) from the same individual but different tasks (‘‘task:rest”), (5) from the same individual between highest motion scans and baseline (“hi:lo motion”), (6) from different individuals (“between person”). Post-hoc comparison between drug conditions was conducted using two-tailed t tests. A related approach using z-transformed Pearson correlation (‘similarity’ rather than distance) was also taken and results were unchanged (Fig. S2c).  The different conditions above were compared by calculating whole brain network change magnitudes as shown in Figs. 1b, S2, and S3c. These are reported in the text as normalized network change scores calculated using the following procedure: We (i) determined network change for each condition compared to baseline as described above, (ii) subtracted within-session distance for all conditions (such that within-session network change = 0), (iii) divided all conditions by day-to-day distance (such that day-to-day network change = 1). Thus, normalized whole brain network change values (e.g. PSIL v Base = 4.58) could be thought of as proportional to day-to-day variability.  We used a classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach to cluster brain networks across fMRI sessions, as described by Gratton and colleagues24. This data driven approach was used to identify how different parameters (e.g. task, drug, individual) affect similarity/distance between networks. MDS places data in multidimensional space based on the similarity (Euclidean distance; correlation-based distances produce similar results) among data points – where in this case a data point represents the linearized upper triangle of a given functional network matrix. Each separate matrix (from a given subject, task, and session) was entered into the classical MDS algorithm (implemented using MATLAB 2019, cmdscale.m). Multiple dimensions of the data were explored. The eigenvectors were multiplied by the original FC matrices to generate a matrix of eigen-weights that corresponded to each dimension.  To assess network specificity of vertex-wise PSIL network change values, we calculated average network change of matched null networks consisting of randomly rotated networks with preserved size, shape, and relative position to each other. Following Gordon & Laumann et al., 2016, we employed a rotation-based null model, in which a subject’s subnetworks were iteratively rotated a random amount around the spherical expansion of the cortical surface. The spatial autocorrelation of smoothed BOLD data means that small networks are more likely to contain a single connectivity pattern than large networks. To create such matched random networks, we rotated each hemisphere of the original networks a random amount around the x, y, and z axes on the spherical expansion of the cortical surface. This procedure randomly relocated each network while maintaining networks’ size, shape, and relative positions to each other. Random rotation followed be computation of RSN-average PSIL network change score was repeated 1000 times to generate null distributions of network change scores. Vertices rotated into the medial wall were not included in the calculation. Actual PSIL network change score was then compared to null rotation permutations to generate a p-value for each of 12 systems (resting state networks) that were consistently present across every subject’s infomap parcellation. For bar graph visualization of ‘PSIL Change by System’ (Figs. 1, S3), RSNs with greater change (p<0.05 based on null rotation permutations) are shown their respective color (as indicated in Fig. S3) and all other RSNs are shown in gray. We used a n approach previously validated to assess spatial complexity (termed entropy) or neural signals39. Temporal principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the full BOLD dense timeseries, which yielded m principal components (m = ~80K surface vertices and subcortical voxels) and associated eigenvalues. The normalized eigenvalue of the i -th principal component was calculated as where m was the number of principal components, λ i and λ i represented the eigenvalue and the normalized eigenvalue of the i -th principal component respectively. Lastly, the NGSC, defined as the normalized entropy of normalized eigenvalues, was computed using the equation:  The NGSC computed above attains values from the interval 0 to 1. The lowest value NGSC=0 would mean the brain-wide BOLD signal consisted of exactly one principal component or spatial mode, and there is maximum global functional connectivity between all vertices. The highest value NGSC=1 would mean the total data variance is uniformly distributed across all m principal components, and a maximum spatial complexity or a lowest functional connectivity is found. To assess if persistent effects of psychedelics, we compared network changes 1–21 days post-psilocybin to pre-drug baseline. The network change analysis (described above) indicated that connectivity at the ‘whole brain’ level did not change following psilocybin (Fig. S2 and S3). A screen was conducted with p>0.05 threshold to identify brain systems or areas showing persisting effects. This analysis identified the anterior hippocampus as a candidate region of interest (ROI) for persisting FC change (see ‘Pre/Post Psilocybin Network Change Analysis’ in Extended Data). We assessed anterior hippocampus FC globally with cortex and specifically with the DMN. A bilateral anterior hippocampus ROI was used to generate a cortex-wide FC seed map for every session. Root-mean-square FC was computer to generate global FC67. Global FC was compared between pre-psilocybin sessions and post-psilocybin using a linear mixed effects model described above (drug condition and task were fixed effects, and Subject ID, MRI session, and head motion were random effects). Post-hoc visualization and timecourses were generated for FC with individual-defined default mode network. Raw fMRI and structural data from (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012) and (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) were run through our in-house registration and processing pipeline described above. These datasets were used for replication, external validation, and generalization to another classic psychedelic (i.e., LSD) for the measures described above (e.g., normalized global spatial complexity, and the MDS-derived psilocybin FC dimension (Dimension 1). Carhart-Harris et al., 2012: N=15 healthy adults completed two scanning sessions (psilocybin and saline) which included eyes-closed resting state BOLD scan for 6 minutes prior to and following I.V. infusion of drug. fMRI data were acquired using a gradient- echo EPI sequence, TR/TE 3000/35 ms, field-of-view = 192 mm, 64 × 64 acquisition matrix, parallel acceleration factor = 2, 90° flip angle. Carhart-Harris et al., 2016: N=22 healthy adults completed two scanning sessions (LSD and saline), which included eyes-closed resting state BOLD scan acquired for 22 minutes following I.V. drug infusion lasting 12 min. fMRI data were acquired using a gradient echo planer imaging sequence, TR/TE = 2000/35ms, field-of-view = 220mm, 64 × 64 acquisition matrix, parallel acceleration factor = 2, 90° flip angle, 3.4mm isotropic voxels.

 Elizabeth Taylor and Faye Dunaway Ruined Star Power As A Craft,"Elizabeth Taylor and Faye Dunaway Made Star Power Into an Art — These HBO Docs Prove It   By Daniel D'Addario  There’s something that unites the recent documentaries “Faye” and “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes.” It isn’t just that both played on HBO — “Faye” launched in July, while “Elizabeth Taylor” is to premiere August 3 — or that both center the stories of legendary, Oscar-winning performers. Faye is, of course, Faye Dunaway, of “Network” and “Chinatown,” while Elizabeth Taylor, one of the most decadently media-hounded figures of the 20th Century, practically needs no introduction at all.  What the films share, though, is a poignant and sometimes painful double yearning. In the documentaries, Dunaway — still with us at age 83, and interviewed recently for this film — and Taylor — who died in 2011 but whose “lost tapes” catalogue an extensive 1964 debriefing with journalist Richard Meryman —  both express doubt, anxiety and even shame for career missteps, misbegotten projects and the ways in which their private troubles played out in public view. The viewer feels for them, first because they are human, and then because their manner of expressing their emotions is so extravagantly more than human. That’s the other yearning at the heart of these documentaries: a sense that the culture can no longer produce great actresses who are, too, stars who glitter quite this brightly.  Both films, happily, are stuffed full of film clips, and both give a sense of their respective subjects’ styles. In director Laurent Bouzereau’s curation in “Faye,” Dunaway, at her best, uses a bracing sense of control in order to shock the viewer all the more when she snaps in grand fashion. (The famous photograph of her the morning after winning her Oscar — used as the featured image in this column — in which she’s gazing into the middle distance, is a supreme example of her powers: We’re seeing, through exhaustion and exhilaration, a woman in utter control of the image she wants to present.) In interviews with the press, Dunaway, while seeming to hold her feelings back, has a relentless erudition and quickness that makes clear just how much of herself was in “Network’s” brilliant executive, or “Chinatown’s” tricky femme fatale. Her interview for the documentary feels like a sort of letting-go, an unburdening of thoughts she might have withheld from the press to this point. But the clarity of thought remains intact.   Meanwhile, filmmaker Nanette Burstein shows Taylor, for all the outsizedness of her fame, carrying herself on screen with a funny self-deprecation, a shrewdness that feels decades ahead of her time. We’re told that Taylor was 32 when she played the fiftysomething Martha in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” and while her physical transformation for the role is indeed impressive, it’s the changes to her soul and bearing — her willingness to flaunt her signs of age in a sort of ironic self-deprecation — that feels most remarkable. And both actors are startingly open about career and personal setbacks they faced, including the public’s coming to pigeonhole them. Dunaway speaks about her bipolar diagnosis and her struggles with alcohol, both things that derailed her ability to trust her great gift, her clear and precise thinking. (Both, also, led to her outsized reputation as a difficult colleague — her composure giving way to a great break isn’t just something that happened for Dunaway onscreen.) And we also get an unpacking of why “Mommie Dearest” — the infamous bomb that toppled her career — was such a severe disappointment. Dunaway believed she was really finding something sharp and true in her depiction of Joan Crawford as an abusive mother, and lost herself in the role so deeply that she couldn’t find her way, in the absence of a surer directorial hand, to coherence. Others who speak in “Faye,” including her son, are better-situated than is Dunaway to judge why it is that she takes a particular project’s failure so hard. Publicity-shy even despite her doing a sweeping interview toward the end of her life, Dunaway poured her personal setbacks and challenges into her work. To reject it, perhaps, is to reject her. Meanwhile, Taylor speaks with sharp frankness about, for instance, her dislike of the film “Butterfield 8” (for which she won her first Oscar, which Taylor credits to sympathy for health struggles she was undergoing) and the dramas of filming “Cleopatra,” which she shot with Richard Burton, one of the loves of her life. Taylor and Burton — two stars of exaggerated appetites, talents and passions — strode atop the world. But their notoriety came with its own frustrations for someone who’d wanted, first, to tell stories: “It’s a losing game!,” Taylor tells Meryman. “People already have a set image. They want to believe either the good or the bad. And if you try and explain, then you lose yourself along the way.”  And we see Taylor’s performance of herself as someone increasingly willing to display her frustration with the press. Asked, at a joint press conference with Burton, about her relationship with ex-husband Eddie Fisher, Taylor snaps “Do you read the papers, love? I suggest you do,” then rolls her eyes and tosses her head back. Later, she tells a journalist from “60 Minutes” that “fighting is one of the greatest exercises in marital togetherness”; when the journalist asks if Burton dominates her in their marriage, she widens those famous eyes and blurts “You must be joking!” That it seems almost like an impulse, rather than the ongoing press approach of someone eager to communicate her weariness with the press’ rapaciousness, is a sign of just how gifted an actress Taylor was.  “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes” constructs, methodically, a case for Taylor as a genius both of performing onscreen and at performing for a sort of media that no longer exists. Both Dunaway, an actress who made a point of revealing as little as possible, and Taylor, one who was willing to give it all away — but with a wink that made the consumer aware that she saw herself being consumed — existed in a media climate both rougher and more predictable than today’s.  That media climate was cruel and heartbreaking to those who became its subjects; it also made legends. No one, likely, would trade today’s way of writing about actresses, for all its flaws, for the way Dunaway and Taylor were written about. And yet other aspects of the culture were better-situated to create legends. Dunaway, reflecting, begins to see, in the work she made, an impact on the world; Taylor leveraged her fame not merely for movieland success but for charitable pursuits astounding in their magnitude and timeliness. (In an exceptional clip in the Taylor documentary, Taylor explains why she began fundraising for the fight against AIDS: Few were speaking out or doing anything, and, she says, “it so angered me that I thought, ‘Bitch, do something yourself!’”) We don’t make stars the way we did in Dunaway and Taylor’s era these days. And that’s a good thing. But, for all the ascendant actors who compel in their own ways, watching these women, in two very strong entries in the celebrity-tells-all canon, can convince a viewer, for a moment, that we don’t, anymore, make them at all. “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes” premieres on HBO and Max on Aug. 3; “Faye” is streaming on Max.

She said, “This is a new way that women be known by their husband’s name.

The Hollywood film is receiving a lot of backlash for featuring a joke about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's “abusive marriage”. (Also read – The Fall Guy movie review: Ryan Gosling, Emily Blunt rise to the occasion in this breezy, bumpy adventure) In the action comedy film, which has been directed by David Leitch, actor Hannah Waddingham’s character, Gail Meyer, at one point makes a reference to Johnny and Amber‘s turbulent relationship, which has caused a stir among viewers. In the scene, Waddingham, who is essaying the role of an executive producer in the movie, walks into a trailer while looking rumpled and tells director Jody Moreno, essayed by Emily, “It’s like Amber and Johnny were just in here”. The line of dialogue has caused some discourse among viewers who have watched the film at screenings. They are taking to social media to express their dismay. The estranged celebrity couple accused each other of domestic violence and abuse since their split in 2016. “Domestic violence is not a joke,” wrote one X user, with one sharing, “As a survivor I can tell you there is not one thing funny about domestic abuse. I will not support this film. Do better Hollywood”. “Oh wow…domestic violence is now a punchline? Disgusting,” wrote another netizen. One user called the joke as “terrible and tasteless”. “That’s basically a throwaway comment muttered under breath, but it earned absolutely ZERO laughs in my screening,” shared the social media user. Several Hollywood portals reached out to Universal Pictures, The Fall Guy’s distributor, for a comment. However, they have not yet responded to the same. After tying the knot in 2015, Johnny and Amber ended their marital union in 15 months. However, it was not a smooth ending as their split caught the public eye in 2019 when Johnny sued his ex-wife for defamation. In 2018, Amber published a Washington Post op-ed about domestic violence. Though she didn't mention him by name in the article, Johnny claimed it came with hints at him. It led to a court battle, which included both actors making allegations of physical, emotional and mental abuse against each other. In December 2022, the legal battle ended with the Pirates of the Caribbean star winning all three defamation claims and millions in damages. Heard also brought a countersuit against Depp, in which she won one of three defamation claims and was awarded $2 million in damages.

"""Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant clash at the Olympic games in Paris.""","Newlyweds Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant head to the Olympics on their European honeymoon tour   ANANT AND RADHIKA AMBANI ARRIVE AT INDIA HOUSE IN PARIS ON 30 JULY, 2024 There has been little time to rest for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant. The world's most famous newlyweds, who recently married against the backdrop of multi-million pound, months-long celebrations, are now touring Europe on a glitzy honeymoon. Their first stop? Paris, of course, for the Olympic Games. Like a phoenix from the ashes, Ivanka Trump is rising again – supporting her father in Milwaukee and after his assassination attempt. But what role will she play in his politics? The couple was spotted in amongst the crowds at the Opening Ceremony, and later enjoyed the gymnastics with the Ambani patriarch, Mukesh, his daughter, Isha, and her husband, Anand Piramal. Radhika sported a bright orange co-ord for the outing, while Anant semaphored his love of the natural world (he owns a 3,000-acre reserve in Jamnagar) in a tropical-print shirt. MUKESH AMBANI AND HIS DAUGHTER, ISHA, ATTENDING THE ARTISTIC GYMNASTICS WOMEN'S TEAM FINAL DURING DAY FOUR OF THE PARIS 2024 OLYMPICS Royalty, rock stars and marital mayhem: Lady Anne Glenconner has seen it all – and tells even more to David Jenkins When they're not keeping an eye on the nail-biting sports, the Ambanis are reportedly enjoying some rest and relaxation at the Four Seasons Hotel George V, near the Champs-Élysées. First opened in 1928, the hotel is known for its exceptional service – no wonder it has long been the Paris hot-spot of choice for the society set. King Charles and Princess Diana have stayed here, as have Elizabeth Taylor, John F. Kennedy and Pablo Picasso. THE EXCLUSIVE FOUR SEASONS HOTEL GEORGE V IN PARIS, WHERE THE AMBANIS ARE REPORTEDLY STAYING Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant have also found time in their busy schedule to drop by India House in Paris, a temporary hospitality hub established by the Ambani family's Reliance Foundation, which aims to promote Indian culture during the Olympics. WATCH Anya Taylor-Joy takes on Tea With Tatler  The centre was opened by Nita, Mukesh's philanthropist wife, who has been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 2016. ‘Today we gather here at the Paris Olympic Games 2024 to open the doors to a dream. A dream that belongs to 1.4 billion Indians. A dream to bring India to the Olympics and our shared dream to bring the Olympics to India,’ she said at the official opening. Boris Johnson and Prince Harry are reportedly set to join in the festivities at Stoke Park, which Mukesh Ambani purchased in 2021. Locals, however, have accused the billionaire of flouting planning guidelines and overhauling the estate for his family's personal use NITA AMBANI AT THE WEDDING OF ANANT AND RADHIKA AMBANI ON 14 JULY, 2024 IN MUMBAI Nita, who was reportedly the brains behind Anant and Radhika's spectacular celebrations, was described by the bride as ‘the CEO of the wedding’. Party planner Preston Bailey agrees: ‘I call her the genius of events,’ he has said. ‘She is quite extraordinary when it comes to details. And this is a woman who is incredibly busy… She knows what works and doesn't work.’ Nita has certainly shown off her knack for organising over the last few months: in the lead up to Anant and Radhika's wedding, she planned an extravagant, three-day pre-nuptial party at which Rihanna performed; next, there was a luxury cruise from Palermo to Portofino, for 800 of the couple's friends. And that's not to mention the wedding itself, a lavish show of couture gowns, flower sculptures and opulent entertainment for 14,000 guests. The ill-fated Empress Elisabeth ‘Sissi’ of Austria, who died on 10 September 1898, has had her story retold countless times on screen. But what is the truth behind the period dramas? NITA AMBANI AND INDIA'S OLYMPIC ATHLETE, SARABJOT SINGH, AT INDIA HOUSE IN PARIS Presumably, she has been instrumental in planning the newlyweds' honeymoon, too. The family has reserved the historic Stoke Park, their property in Berkshire, until September – rumour has it they're planning on hosting a few more parties, with Boris Johnson and Prince Harry tipped to be guests. Until then, however, we should expect to see Anant and Radhika jet-setting around Europe, attending every important society event – with their influential family firmly in tow, no doubt. Will they show up at Burghley Horse Trials? The Louis Vuitton America's Cup? No one can know for sure, but one thing is for certain: wherever they are, an excellent party must surely follow.

Rahul Gandhi to retain Wayanad Lok Sabha seat,"Wayanad prepares for by-poll after Rahul Gandhi vacates    Updated - June 17, 2024 09:20 pm IST Published - June 17, 2024 09:07 pm IST - KALPETTA Congress leaders and brother-sister duo Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra share a hug after the announcement of Priyanka’s candidature from the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, in New Delhi on June 17, 2024.   Photo Credit: ANI Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency is preparing for a by-poll after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi decided to retain Rae Bareli. Though Mr Gandhi had expressed his anguish regarding which constituency he should abandon — Wayanad or Rae Bareli- during his recent visit in Wayanad, finally he decided to vacate Wayanad. Mr. Gandhi had won both Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh and Wayanad in the recent Lok Sabha polls. A meeting of senior leaders of the Congress part, on June 17, at Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge’s house in Delhi decided to leave the Wayanad constituency and retain Rai Beariely. It also decided to nominate his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from Wayanad. Mr. Gandhi had scripted a huge victory in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency for the second time with a margin of 3,64,422 votes over his nearest rival Annie Raja of the Communist Party of India. While Mr. Gandhi polled 6,47,445 votes, Annie Raja received 2,83,023 votes. BJP candidate K. Surendran stood in third position with 1,41,045 votes. Mr Gandhi had won the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Wayanad with a record majority of 4,31,770 votes. Now all eyes are on Ms. Priyanka Gandhi to see if she could repeat the astonishing majority scripted by Mr. Gandhi in Wayanad and who would be the LDF and NDA candidates against her. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Gandhi secured a majority of 64.8% votes while CPI’s P.P. Suneer came second with 25.2% votes. Mr. Gandhi’s performance as the MP, and the national leader of a major party won the people’s favour for the second time. Ms. Annie Raja, a national leader of the CPI, showcased good performance and carried out an intensive campaign. However, her efforts did not come to fruition. BJP State President K. Surendran was the third major contender whose campaign failed to bring about positive results, though the vote share of BJP increased considerably. Mr. Gandhi won the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh by a margin of 3,90,030 votes, bettering his mother Sonia Gandhi’s victory margin in 2019. The Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency has supported the Congress party since its inception in 2009. Earlier IUML State president Panakkad Sadiqali Shihab Thangal and IUML national General Secretary P.K. Kunhalikkutty had urged the Congress leaders to consider Ms. Gandhi for the Wayanad seat if Mr. Gandhi would leave it. They said such a move would strengthen the UDF in the State.

"""In the seven days after President Biden stepped down as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Harris campaign received a mere $20 million.""","Harris Campaign Says It Raised $310 Million in July, More Than Double Trump’s Haul   ADVERTISEMENT In the seven days after President Biden stepped down as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Harris campaign raked in $200 million. By Theodore Schleifer Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign survived a brutal few weeks of fund-raising in July to bounce back so dramatically before the end of the month that she more than doubled the amount of money raised by former President Donald J. Trump, her campaign announced on Friday. The Harris campaign, which for the first 20 days of July was the Biden campaign, said it had raised $310 million during the month, including $200 million in just seven days after President Biden dropped out of the race. The Trump campaign and its own allies said on Thursday that they had collected $139 million in July, an enormous sum but well short of what the Harris campaign said it had brought in amid a huge burst of enthusiasm about her candidacy. The Harris campaign raised almost as much in July as the Biden campaign had raised in March, April, May and June combined. The surge in fund-raising has allowed Democrats, for the first time in months, to have a cash-on-hand advantage over Republicans. The Harris campaign said it now had $377 million in its war chest, in contrast to the $327 million that the Trump campaign has said it has. ADVERTISEMENT Neither campaign disclosed precisely how much of the money was raised or held by the campaigns themselves versus their allied party committees. Democrats’ fund-raising was said to have plummeted in the first three weeks of the month, in the aftermath of Mr. Biden’s disastrous debate, although precise figures were not known or released by the Biden campaign. But after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, the fund-raising spigot was opened wide. The $200 million that the Harris campaign said it had raised in the week after Mr. Biden ended his re-election bid was more than Mr. Biden’s haul in the first three months of the year. The Trump campaign’s own fund-raising was strong — and most likely would have far outstripped the Democrats’ had the party not changed its standard-bearer. The $139 million raised in July amounted to one of the Trump team’s strongest fund-raising months to date, just off the sum raised in May, when Mr. Trump’s supporters responded to his felony conviction with $141 million in donations. After collecting $112 million in June, donations for the Trump team ticked up in July as Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt, was formally nominated at the Republican convention in Milwaukee and picked Senator JD Vance of Ohio to be his running mate — events that surely motivated his donors and supporters. July was the second straight month in which Democrats out-raised the Trump team. In June, when Mr. Biden was still atop the ticket, his campaign raised $127 million and ended the month with $240 million on hand, all before the history-making events that would unfold over the next four weeks.

"""A day after claiming White journalists that Vice President Kamala Harris had recently decided to become 'a White person,' Mr. Trump shared a photo of Ms. Harris in traditional African attire.""","'Is she black or Indian?': Trump questions Harris' racial identity  Donald Trump has questioned Kamala Harris' racial identity during a heated exchange at a convention for black journalists. Trump falsely claimed the vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee had only emphasised her Asian-American heritage until recently when, he claimed, ""she became a black person"". ""I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black,"" he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago on Wednesday. ""So I don't know - Is she Indian? Or is she black?"" Ms Harris said Trump's remarks were ""the same old show"" of ""divisiveness... and disrespect"". ""The American people deserve better,"" she told a meeting of the historically black sorority Sigma Gamma Rho in Houston. ""We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us - they are an essential source of our strength."" Ms Harris is the first black and Asian-American vice-president, with Indian and Jamaican-born parents. She attended Howard University, a historically black university, and joined the predominantly black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She became a member of Congressional Black Caucus after entering the Senate in 2017. Trump's claims prompted a heated exchange with ABC News' correspondent Rachel Scott, one of the moderators of the Chicago event. ""I respect either one,"" the Republican said in reference to Harris' racial identity. ""But she obviously doesn't because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a black person."" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said no-one ""has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify. That is no-one's right."" ""Since when is Donald Trump, with his long and ugly history of racism, the arbiter of Blackness?"" congressman Ritchie Torres of New York posted on X. He described Trump as a “relic of a racist past"". The Republican nominee and former president has a history of attacking his opponents on the basis of race. He falsely accused Barack Obama, the country's first black president, of not being born in the US. Trump attacked the former UN ambassador and his Republican primary opponent Nikki Haley by falsely claiming she could not be president because her parents were not US citizens when she was born. Ms Harris has faced a series of attacks since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republicans have criticised the decision, saying she was chosen only because of her race. Tim Burchett, a Republican congressman from Tennessee, called her a ""DEI vice-president"" - a reference to diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. On Wednesday, Scott pushed Trump to clarify whether he believed Ms Harris was a ""DEI hire"". He replied: ""I really don't know, could be."" Ms Harris has described growing up engaged with her Indian heritage and often visited the country. Her mother also immersed her two daughters in the black culture of Oakland, California - where she was raised, she said. Trump also attacked Ms Harris' credentials during the discussion, saying she had failed her bar exam early in her legal career. His comments were met with murmurs from the crowd. ""I'm just giving you the facts. She didn't pass her bar exam and she didn't think she would pass it and she didn't think she was going to ever pass it and I don't know what happened. Maybe she passed it,"" he said. Ms Harris graduated from the University of California Hastings College of Law in 1989. The New York Times reported that she failed her first attempt and passed at the second. The state bar of California says fewer than half of those who sit the test pass on the first attempt. The Chicago discussion began with a contentious back and forth between Scott and the former president. Trump accused the journalist of giving a ""very rude introduction"" when she began the conversation asking about his past criticism of black people. She cited Trump calling black journalists' questions ''stupid and racist'' and that he had ''dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar a Lago resort''. ""I love the black population of this country, I’ve done so much for the black population of this country,” he responded. The former president criticised the conversation hours later on his social media platform. ""The questions were rude and nasty, often in the form of a statement, but we CRUSHED IT!"" he said.

" The son of the prosecutor in Donald J. Trump’s Manhattan civil case has consulted for Republican candidates, with his connection to the president remaining ambiguous.","Who is Juan Merchan, the 'no-nonsense' judge who oversaw Trump's hush-money case?  Donald Trump has described the judge who oversaw his hush-money trial - where he was found guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records - as a ""certified Trump hater"". Others say New York County Supreme Court Justice Juan Manuel Merchan is a tough and no-nonsense but fair jurist. Before this case, the most high-profile to ever cross his courtroom, Justice Merchan served 17 years on the bench. He is also no stranger to the drama Trump brings to the justice system. Legally speaking, the jurist and newly-convicted felon have crossed paths before. In 2022, Justice Merchan presided over the tax-fraud trial that led to the conviction of the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. He is also the judge for the fraud and money-laundering case against Steve Bannon, a staunch Trump ally. That trial begins in September. Before, during and since the trial ended, Trump has relentlessly slammed Justice Merchan, both in public remarks and on social media. He has accused the judge of bias, conflict of interest and repeated rulings against the defence - comments that mirror what he has said about officials involved in his other trials. Justice Merchan began his legal career in 1994, when he graduated from Hofstra University School of Law. He worked as a prosecutor, first in the New York County District Attorney's Office, then as an assistant attorney general in both Nassau and Suffolk counties. He was appointed a family court judge in 2006. But since 2009, he has presided over criminal matters at the New York County Supreme Court. ""He's a serious jurist, smart and even-tempered,"" Manhattan defence attorney Ron Kuby told NBC News. ""He's not one of those judges who yells at lawyers, and is characterised as a no-nonsense judge. But he's always in control of the courtroom."" In the case against the Trump Organization, Justice Merchan was adamant that the charges were absolutely not politically motivated. The organisation's lawyer had argued Weisselberg was being targeted because of his association with the former president. ""I will not allow you in any way to bring up a selective prosecution claim, or claim this is some sort of novel prosecution,"" Justice Merchan said, according to the BBC's news partner CBS. Justice Merchan is known for his reserved nature. He is not a loud man, which can make it a bit difficult to hear him when he makes an important decision in court, but he is no pushover, either. Throughout the trial, he pushed back against Trump's defence team when it tried to challenge their client's gag order or attempted to expand the parameters of his directions and instructions. The gag order prohibited the former president from speaking about the witnesses, jurors and others involved in the case - and the judge fined Trump $1,000 each for 10 alleged violations of the order. But he added that he knew the fines had a limited effect because of Trump's wealth. He warned at the time that, as ""a last resort"", he would consider jailing the defendant for further infractions. ""Mr Trump, it's important to understand that the last thing I want to do is to put you in jail,"" he said in court. ""You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president, as well."" That threat appeared to mollify Trump in the interim, but it was not the only time the judge would address bad behaviour during the trial. He cleared the courtroom to scold the case's final witness - Robert Costello - who the defence had called to rebut claims made by Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and the prosecution's star witness. Mr Costello, an outspoken critic of the case, expressed frustration on the stand and audibly said ""jeez"" when the judge sustained multiple objections from prosecutors that cut off his responses. After sending out those seated in the benches, he chastised the former federal prosecutor about ""proper decorum in my courtroom"". ""You don't say 'jeez'. And then if you don't like my ruling, you don't give me side eye, and you don't roll your eyes,"" he told the witness. Soon after Trump was arraigned, records emerged showing Justice Merchan had donated a total of $35 to Democrats during the 2020 election. That included a $15 donation to Joe Biden's campaign, NBC News reported, as well as $10 donations to groups called the ""Progressive Turnout Project"" and ""Stop Republicans"". New York state, following the American Bar Association's guidance, prohibits judges from making contributions to political organisations or candidates. Even though the donations were ill-advised, they would be ""viewed as trivial, especially given the small sums"", Stephen Gillers, an expert on legal ethics at New York University, told the BBC. Justice Merchan did not recuse himself over the donations. The judge's daughter, Loren Merchan, was at the centre of a bigger conflict-of-interest storm. Ms Merchan is president of Authentic Campaigns, a firm that has worked on digital fundraising and advertising for Democratic clients, including Mr Biden and Adam Schiff, a top Trump critic on Capitol Hill who led efforts to impeach him. This again prompted Trump to push for the judge's removal from the case, and Justice Merchan consulted with the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics over the matter. But the panel determined ""the matter currently before the judge does not involve either the judge's relative or the relative's business, whether directly or indirectly"". With that established, the judge declined to recuse himself from the case. Trump also blasted Ms Merchan on social media, leading prosecutors to request an expansion of the former president's gag order to include the judge's family. Justice Merchan approved that request. Comments about Ms Merchan could cause the judge to worry about the safety of his ""loved ones"", he wrote, which would ""undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice"". Under the expanded order, Trump was barred from speaking about witnesses, jurors, court staff, lawyers for the prosecution, and their families. But he was not precluded from speaking about the judge or Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Mr Bragg, the lead prosecutor. Trump decried the gag order as violating his constitutional right to free speech. The group includes students, Catholic laypeople and members of a Texas-based Evangelical group. The president's son faces his second federal trial of the year, accused of avoiding paying more than $1m. The first debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will take place on 10 September.

" The Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller investigated whether a Trump adviser was part of an Egyptian plan, proven, to funnel $10 million to the 2016 Trump campaign.","Alongside the Trump-Russia Inquiry, a Lesser-Known Look at Egyptian Influence  Trump’s Legal Troubles ADVERTISEMENT  The Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller investigated whether a Trump adviser was part of an Egyptian plan, never proven, to funnel $10 million to the 2016 Trump campaign. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Michael S. SchmidtAdam Goldman and Glenn Thrush In the summer of 2017, as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was starting his investigation, his agents and prosecutors were chasing potentially explosive allegations about foreign influence over Donald J. Trump and his campaign. C.I.A. intelligence relayed to the special counsel’s office suggested that senior leaders of a foreign power had signed off on secretly funneling millions of dollars — with the help of a Trump campaign adviser acting as “a bag man” — to Mr. Trump in the final days of the 2016 election. Interviews and other evidence obtained by the special counsel’s office showed that indeed Mr. Trump had lent his campaign a similar amount of money in the final days of the race — and, after beating Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump immediately struck a far more favorable tone toward the country than his predecessors. The country in question, however, was not Russia. It was Egypt. Seven years after Mr. Mueller’s team dug in on those allegations, people familiar with the investigation acknowledged that while much of the country’s attention was focused on ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, the most concrete lead Mr. Mueller’s team initially had about potential foreign influence over Mr. Trump involved Egypt. The people familiar with the inquiry discussed details of it on the condition of anonymity. ADVERTISEMENT While Mr. Mueller has often been criticized for not moving aggressively enough to investigate Mr. Trump’s personal and financial ties to Russia, his team took invasive steps to try to understand whether Mr. Trump or his campaign had received financial backing from Cairo. Mr. Trump’s foreign business ties and efforts by foreign interests and government to influence him have come under scrutiny again as he seeks to return to the White House. The little-known investigation into possible Egyptian influence shows both the intensity of past efforts to explore the issue and how they have fueled Mr. Trump’s long-running assertions that he has been subject to a “witch hunt.” Case Tracker: Trump is facing multiple criminal cases related to his business and political activities.

Trump on Trial Newsletter: Sign up here to get the latest news and analysis on the cases in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C. The Egypt investigation would outlast Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, which shut down in 2019. It was picked up by career prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, who closed it out in the summer of 2020 without pursuing any charges. No evidence has ever surfaced publicly that Mr. Trump or his campaign directly received Egyptian money. Details about the depth and breadth of the investigation have trickled out over the years. CNN laid out major elements of the investigation in October 2020, including that there was a secret legal fight between the Justice Department and an Egyptian bank. Investigators at the time were seeking bank records related to the matter, which ultimately ended up — under seal — being appealed to the Supreme Court. The Washington Post on Friday disclosed further details, reporting that five days before Mr. Trump took office in 2017 an organization linked to Egyptian intelligence withdrew $10 million in cash from a bank in Cairo — the same amount that the C.I.A. had been told was given to Mr. Trump in the final days of his campaign. The report about the withdrawal was confirmed to The New York Times by a person briefed on the investigation. ADVERTISEMENT The investigation started in the days after the 2016 election when the C.I.A. learned from a trusted confidential source that senior Egyptian leaders — including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi — had signed off on sending $10 million to Mr. Trump’s cash strapped campaign. The Egyptian leaders, investigators would be told, had in mind someone in Mr. Trump’s orbit to move the money: a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser named Walid Phares, who had frequently appeared on Fox News. The F.B.I. opened an investigation into Mr. Phares, with investigators trying to understand whether he was “a bag man.” Mr. Trump’s first C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, was briefed on the details of the agency’s intelligence. In May 2017, Mr. Mueller was appointed special counsel after questions were raised about Mr. Trump’s attempts to interfere in F.B.I. investigations into his ties to Russia. Mr. Mueller was given a mandate to investigate Russia’s effort to influence the 2016 election and ties that four Trump campaign advisers had to Russia. What the public did not know at the time was that Mr. Mueller had also been given the job of investigating Mr. Phares and the intelligence suggesting that Egypt had sought to funnel money to Mr. Trump. ADVERTISEMENT Throughout the investigation, Mr. Mueller’s team was confronted with a range of allegations about Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. But, in the eyes of some agents and prosecutors working on Mr. Mueller’s team, the intelligence about Egypt was far firmer than anything they had related to Mr. Trump and Russia. At the time, Mr. Trump was threatening to fire Mr. Mueller, drawing a red line around his personal finances. But the evidence about Egypt allowed agents and prosecutors to convince Mr. Mueller to subpoena Mr. Trump’s bank records from the period of time during the campaign and just after the election that he might have received the money. The records were not helpful in corroborating the allegations, the people familiar with the investigation said. Some investigators wanted to continue digging, but Mr. Mueller stopped short of seeking the records from when Mr. Trump took office, leaving some investigators disappointed. Mr. Mueller’s investigators did devote significant resources to looking at Mr. Phares, who had told Trump campaign advisers that he could broker meetings between the Egyptian government and the campaign. Mr. Phares also took credit for arranging a September 2016 meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. el-Sisi, which investigators later examined. ADVERTISEMENT American intelligence agencies had learned what agents and analysts thought was potentially corroborating evidence: that there were questions atop the Egyptian government whether Mr. Phares could be trusted to deliver the money. The F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Phares on multiple occasions, learning new details such as his contacts with Egyptian intelligence officials. But despite Mr. Phares initial cooperation with the investigators, he eventually hired a lawyer and stopped talking. By 2019, Mr. Mueller’s team thought it had taken the investigation as far as it could. When Mr. Mueller’s Russia inquiry wound down, he referred the still-open Egyptian case to Justice Department prosecutors, who picked up where he left off. It was around that same time that U.S. officials learned of the $10 million bank withdrawal in Cairo by the group linked to Egyptian intelligence agencies, sparking more suspicions among investigators. In June 2020, The Times reported that the F.B.I. and special counsel’s office had investigated whether Mr. Phares had secretly worked for the Egyptian government to try to influence the incoming Trump administration. Mr. Phares declined to comment at the time and could not be reached on Friday. But that summer, prosecutors decided they had hit a wall and closed out the case. Michael S.

"""American family denied entry to Taylor Swift concert for the worst reason""","5 Reasons Why Taylor Swift's Eras Tour Will Be The Most Legendary Of Her Generation How Sabrina Carpenter Became A Pop Queen: Tracing Her Journey To 'Short N' Sweet' Behind Ryan Tedder's Hits: Stories From The Studio With OneRepublic, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift & More ""Let Yourself Be Idiosyncratic"": Moby Talks New Album 'Always Centered At Night' & 25 Years Of 'Play' The Environmental Impact Of Touring: How Scientists, Musicians & Nonprofits Are Trying To Shrink Concerts' Carbon Footprint   PHOTO: JOHN SHEARER/TAS23/GETTY IMAGES FOR TAS RIGHTS MANAGEMENT LIST Whether she's breaking records or breaking Ticketmaster, Taylor Swift has proven time and again that she's one of the most powerful figures in modern music — and the Eras Tour is a manifestation of that. Since the moment Taylor Swift announced the Eras Tour, there was no denying that it was going to be the tour of the year. From playing impressive two- and three-night stands at stadiums across the country to crashing Ticketmaster upon just the presale, the Eras Tour was making headlines before it even began. But after witnessing it in person, it's clear that Swift is not just delivering the tour of the year — it's the tour of her generation.  Sure, Beyoncé fans can't wait for her tour this summer; Harry Styles is about to embark on the final leg of his highly successful Love On Tour trek; BLACKPINK sold out stadiums around the country too. Yet, it's hard to imagine that any other tour this year will have a cultural impact as big as the Eras Tour — something that's wildly apparent whether or not you were there. Even before Swift hit the stage for her first night at Nashville's Nissan Stadium on May 5, her influence was felt. Practically every fan of the 70,000 in attendance (a record for the venue — more on that later) was wearing some sort of reference to their favorite Swift era: a beloved lyric, or an iconic performance or music video look. While that's not necessarily a new trend in the Swiftie world, seeing all 10 of her eras represented throughout a stadium-sized crowd was equal parts meaningful and remarkable.  As someone who has been to hundreds of tours and most of Swift's — including the Reputation Tour, which I naively referred to as ""the peak of her career"" — I didn't think this one would feel much different than a typical stadium show. But even when Swift was just a few songs in of her impressive three-and-a-half hour set, a feeling came over me like I wasn't just watching one of music's greats — I was part of music history.                  PHOTO: ALERIE MACON / AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES FEATURE More than a decade in the making, Sabrina Carpenter is living out her superstar dreams. As she releases her new album, 'Short n' Sweet,' look back on the chart-topping star's journey and how every venture helped her evolve into a pop phenom. Sabrina Carpenter is the first to admit that it's taken her a bit of time to find her way to the top of the music industry. She even likens herself to the tortoise in the fable ""The Tortoise and the Hare"" — even if she didn't want to believe the metaphor growing up. ""Something that my mom always said to me as a little girl that really annoyed me was that I am the tortoise… throughout my life, [I was] being told, 'Sabrina, you're the tortoise, just chill,'"" Carpenter recalled while accepting the Variety Hitmakers Rising Artist Award in December 2023. ""In moments of frustration and confusion it can feel like a letdown, but it turns out it's actually a very good thing."" It's been a very good thing for Carpenter, indeed. A decade since the release of her debut single, the singer/songwriter isn't just breaking through — she's one of pop's new reigning queens. Over the last year, Carpenter has nabbed her first No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100, made a stellar debut at Coachella, and performed on ""Saturday Night Live,"" all the while racking up billions of streams on her music new and old. It's all built excitement for one of the most anticipated pop albums of the summer: Short n' Sweet. As Carpenter unveils her new album, take a deep dive into her decade-long journey to pop stardom.                                  PHOTO: JEREMY COWART INTERVIEW As OneRepublic releases their latest album, the group's frontman and pop maverick gives an inside look into some of the biggest songs he's written — from how Beyoncé operates to Tom Cruise's prediction for their 'Top Gun' smash. Three months after OneRepublic began promoting their sixth album, Artificial Paradise, in February 2022, the band unexpectedly had their biggest release in nearly a decade. The pop-rock band's carefree jam, ""I Ain't Worried,"" soundtracked Top Gun: Maverick's most memeable scene and quickly became a global smash — ultimately delaying album plans in favor of promoting their latest hit. Two years later, ""I Ain't Worried"" is one of 16 tracks on Artificial Paradise, which arrived July 12. It's a seamless blend of songs that will resonate with longtime and newer fans alike. From the layered production of ""Hurt,"" to the feel-good vibes of ""Serotonin,"" to the evocative lyrics of ""Last Holiday,"" Artificial Paradise shows that OneRepublic's sound is as dialed-in as it is ever-evolving. The album also marks the end of an era for OneRepublic, as it's the last in their contract with Interscope Records. But for the group's singer, Ryan Tedder, that means the future is even more exciting than it's been in their entire 15-year career. ""I've never been more motivated to write the best material of my life than this very moment,"" he asserts. ""I'm taking it as a challenge. We've had a lot of fun, and a lot of uplifting records for the last seven or eight years, but I also want to tap back into some deeper material with the band."" As he's been prepping Artificial Paradise with his OneRepublic cohorts, Tedder has also been as busy as he's ever been working with other artists. His career as a songwriter/producer took off almost simultaneously with OneRepublic's 2007 breakthrough, ""Apologize"" (his first major behind-the-board hit was Leona Lewis' ""Bleeding Love""); to this day he's one of the go-to guys for pop's biggest names, from BLACKPINK to Tate McRae. Tedder sat down with GRAMMY.com to share some of his most prominent memories of OneRepublic's biggest songs, as well as some of the hits he's written with                                                   PHOTO: MIKE FORMANSKI INTERVIEW ""We're not writing for a pop audience, we don't need to dumb it down,"" Moby says of creating his new record. In an interview, the multiple-GRAMMY nominee reflects on his latest album and how it contrasts with his legendary release from 1999. Moby’s past and present are converging in a serendipitous way. The multiple-GRAMMY nominee is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his seminal work, Play, the best-selling electronic dance music album of all time, and the release of his latest album, always centered at night.  Where Play was a solitary creation experience for Moby, always centered at night is wholly collaborative. Recognizable names on the album are Lady Blackbird on the blues-drenched ""dark days"" and serpentwithfeet on the emotive ""on air."" But always centered at night’s features are mainly lesser-known artists, such as the late Benjamin Zephaniah on the liquid jungle sounds of ""where is your pride?"" and Choklate on the slow grooves of ""sweet moon.""  Moby’s music proves to have staying power: His early ‘90s dance hits ""Go"" and ""Next is the E"" still rip up dancefloors; the songs on Play are met with instant emotional reactions from millennials who heard them growing up. Moby is even experiencing a resurgence of sorts with Gen Z. In 2023, Australian drum ‘n’ bass DJ/producer Luude and UK vocalist Issey Cross reimagined Moby’s classic ""Porcelain"" into ""Oh My."" Earlier this year, Moby released ""You and Me"" with Italian DJ/producer Anfisa Letyago.                               PHOTO: MARCELO HERNANDEZ/GETTY IMAGES FEATURE ""It’s not just [about] a single tour, it’s every tour,"" singer Brittany Howard says of efforts to make concerts more sustainable. From the nonprofit that partnered with Billie Eilish, to an MIT initiative, the music industry aims to curb climate change. Beloved by fans around the globe, yet increasingly unaffordable for many artists, concert tours are central to the world of entertainment and local economies. After the pandemic-era global shuttering of concert venues large and small, tours are back, and bigger than ever.   Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour is smashing records, selling more than four million tickets and earning more than $1 billion. But that tour made headlines for another reason: as reported in Business Insider and other outlets, for a six-month period in 2023, Swift’s two jets spent a combined 166 hours in the air between concerts, shuttling at most a total of 28 passengers.  Against that backdrop, heightened concerns about the global environmental cost of concert touring have led a number of prominent artists to launch initiatives. Those efforts seek both to mitigate the negative effects of touring and communicate messages about sustainability to concertgoers.  A 2023 study sponsored by Texas-based electricity provider Payless Power found that the carbon footprint of many touring bands was massive. In 2022, concert tours in five genres — country, classic rock, hip-hop/rap, metal and pop — were responsible for CO2 emissions totaling nearly 45,000 metric tons. A so-called greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide contributes to climate change by radiative forcing; increased levels of CO2 also contribute to health problems.   No serious discussion of climate issues suggests a worldwide halt to live music touring, but there exists much room for improvement. Both on their own and with the help of dedicated nonprofit organizations, many artists are taking positive steps toward mitigating the deleterious effects that touring exerts upon the environment.   Smart tour planning is one way to lessen an artist’s carbon footprint. Ed Sheeran’s 2022 European run minimized flights between concert venues, making that leg of his tour the year's most environmentally efficient. Total carbon dioxide emissions (from flights and driving) on Sheeran’s tour came to less than 150 metric tons.

"""Trump rally shooter's roof was unmonitored by Secret Service, claims acting director""","Rooftop where gunman shot at Trump was identified as a security vulnerability before rally: sources          The rooftop where a gunman shot at former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally was identified by the Secret Service as a potential vulnerability in the days before the event, two sources familiar with the agency’s operations told NBC News. The building, owned by a glass research company, is adjacent to the Butler Farm Show, an outdoor venue in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service was aware of the risks associated with it, the sources said. “Someone should have been on the roof or securing the building so no one could get on the roof,” said one of the sources, a former senior Secret Service agent who was familiar with the planning.  Understanding how the gunman got onto the roof — despite those concerns — is a central question for investigators scrutinizing how a lone attacker managed to shoot at Trump during Saturday’s campaign event. The Secret Service worked with local law enforcement to maintain event security, including sniper teams poised on rooftops to identify and eliminate threats, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. But no officers were posted on the building used by the would-be assassin, outside the event’s security perimeter but only about 148 yards from the stage — within range of a semiautomatic rifle like the one the gunman was carrying. The Secret Service had designated that rooftop as being under the jurisdiction of local law enforcement, a common practice in securing outdoor rallies, Guglielmi said.Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger said his office maintains an Emergency Services Unit team, which deployed four sniper teams and four “quick response teams” at the rally. But he said the Secret Service agents were in charge of security outside the venue.  “They had meetings in the week prior. The Secret Service ran the show. They were the ones who designated who did what,” Goldinger said. “In the command hierarchy, they were top, they were No. 1.” Goldinger said the commander of the Emergency Services Unit told him it was not responsible for securing areas outside the venue. “To me, the whole thing is under the jurisdiction of the Secret Service. And they will delineate from there,” he said. The former senior Secret Service agent also said that even if local law enforcement “did drop the ball,” it’s still the agency’s responsibility “to ensure that they are following through either beforehand or in the moment.” “Just because it is outside of the perimeter, it doesn’t take it out of play for a vulnerability, and you’ve got to mitigate it in some fashion,” the source added. A volley of shots rang out minutes into Trump’s speech. He reached for his right ear — he said later it was pierced by a bullet — then dropped to the ground as Secret Service agents rushed to shield him. Trump emerged with blood on his ear and his face. One attendee was killed, and two others were injured.Witnesses listening to Trump’s speech from outside the event’s security perimeter recalled pointing out the gunman to law enforcement a couple of minutes before the shooting began. After the gunfire started, Secret Service personnel shot and killed the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks. The clamor over the Secret Service’s biggest failure since the shooting of President Ronald Reagan in 1981 is coming from both political parties, from former agents and from security experts. “My question is: How did he get onto that roof undetected?” said Anthony Cangelosi, a former Secret Service agent who worked on protective details for presidential candidates, including John Kerry in 2004. The Secret Service’s work on campaign events like Saturday’s begins with advance planning, setting up a security perimeter and positioning teams on the ground and on rooftops — often in partnership with local law enforcement. The ground deployments include a counterassault team, and the rooftop personnel include counter-sniper teams. Guglielmi, the Secret Service spokesman, said the agency had two of its counterassault agents at the event and filled out the rest of the platoon with at least six officers from Butler County tactical units. The Secret Service also deployed two counter-sniper teams. Two other security units needed for the event were staffed by local law enforcement agencies, Guglielmi said. Those details were first reported by The Washington Post.Investigators will want to examine the Secret Service’s site security plan for the rally, said Cangelosi, the former Secret Service agent. He expects they’ll discover one of two things: Either officials failed to make an effective plan for keeping potential shooters off the building Crooks fired from, or officers on the ground failed to execute the plan. “I don’t like making any assumptions, but it does look like some mistakes were made, that this was preventable,” said Cangelosi, now a lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Although it’s common to task local law enforcement agencies with patrolling outside an event’s security perimeter, Cangelosi said, the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that all vulnerabilities are covered rests with the Secret Service. If officials had placed an officer on the building where the gunman fired from, Cangelosi said, chances are he “wouldn’t even attempt what he attempted.” “You don’t surrender the discretion of what’s supposed to be done to the local police,” he said. “In other words, you guys have the outer perimeter, but you would want to say, ‘We need an officer on that roof.’ Not ‘that’s your responsibility; do what you see fit.’” Jim Cavanaugh, a retired special agent in charge with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who has worked on Secret Service details, told NBC News that while the Secret Service did a good job taking out the gunman after shots began, the failure to post officers on the building he scaled was “a tremendous lapse.” “The only way to stop that is you have a lot of people, you get there first, and you command the high ground,” Cavanaugh said. “This is basic, and the Secret Service has done it for years successfully, so I’m really surprised that they did not have that high ground covered.” The questions extended to Congress, where members demanded answers from the Secret Service and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security.“This raises serious concerns regarding how a shooter was able to access a rooftop within range and direct line of sight of where President Trump was speaking,” House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Green asked Mayorkas to provide documentation relating to the event’s security plan, the screening of attendees and the level of resources provided to Trump’s Secret Service detail. A committee spokesperson told NBC News that Republican members would hold a briefing with Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Monday “to voice their concerns and ask pressing questions.” Another lawmaker, Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., wrote Cheatle asking who approved the security plan, whether a proper threat assessment was conducted, whether attendees raised alarms and whether there were failures in following protocols that allowed the attack to happen. “I call on all those responsible for the planning, approving, and executing of this failed security plan to be held accountable and to testify before Congress immediately,” Gallego wrote in a letter to Cheatle. Robert McDonald, a former Secret Service agent who ran protection for Joe Biden when he was vice president, told NBC News that he believes the assassination attempt will prompt soul-searching and procedural changes at the agency. “The Secret Service is going to need to ask some hard questions of itself here and be prepared to stand up and represent why, what happened,” McDonald said. Cangelosi, the former Secret Service agent, said investigators are also likely to ask when agents identified Crooks as a potential threat, how they reacted and whether it’s possible they could have taken him down before he fired at Trump.Secret Service snipers are trained to make rapid decisions, he said. But it’s possible that if they noticed Crooks on the roof but couldn’t tell whether he had a rifle, agents might have waited to fire on him. “If the sniper can’t tell whether he has a gun, he or she is not going to take the shot,” Cangelosi said. “Because God forbid it’s a child who’s just excited to see a political candidate, right? So you want to make sure that there’s actually a threat.” If there was uncertainty, Cangelosi said, it’s possible the sniper team would have dispatched officers to investigate and confirm. But investigating a potential threat can take minutes, he said, while a gunman with a semiautomatic rifle can fire several shots in a matter of seconds. That’s why, Cangelosi said, the best defense would have been to plan ahead to keep the shooter off the roof in the first place. “Who wants to be in that position?” he said of the snipers protecting Trump on Saturday. “You’ve got to make a split-second call. And imagine if you’re wrong.” Sarah Fitzpatrick is a senior investigative producer and story editor for NBC News. She previously worked for CBS News and ""60 Minutes.""

"""Uncertain Jewish Republicans question if America is prepared for a Christian vice president""","Political opponents Harris and Vance show Americans modern, interfaith marriages  Sarah McCammon In this file photo, Vice President Harris (L) and second gentleman Doug Emhoff attend the 100th National Christmas Tree Lighting on The Ellipse south of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 30, 2022. Harris and Emhoff host holiday celebrations at their official residence, including recently for Diwali and Rosh Hashanah. At the Democratic National Convention, second gentleman Doug Emhoff wanted to show another side of his wife. “Kamala has connected me more deeply to my faith, even though it’s not the same as hers,” he said, highlighting his interfaith marriage to Vice President Harris. Emhoff is Jewish and Harris is Christian. He said she attends High Holiday services with him, and he attends Easter services with her. And, he said, they share their food traditions. “I get to enjoy her mom’s chili relleno recipe every Christmas, and she makes a mean brisket for Passover,” Emhoff said to applause. At a National Prayer Breakfast in 2022, Harris talked about the values she’d grown up with in church in Oakland, Calif. “As I know we have all learned and been taught, faith is not passive,” Harris said. “Faith motivates action.” A growing number of Americans are part of interfaith relationships — a reality that is also reflected in the candidates on both major-party presidential tickets this year. On the Republican ticket, the vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is also in an interfaith marriage. Republican vice presidential candidate, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) is joined by his wife Usha Chilukuri Vance on stage on the third day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Vance spoke about his relationship at an event hosted by the conservative Faith and Freedom Coalition on the day after he’d addressed the Republican National Convention in July. “What really brought me back to Christ was finding a wife,” Vance said. Vance said he was motivated to rediscover his faith as he thought about how to become a better husband and father. “It’s funny, my wife, despite not being raised Christian herself, she made this observation to me when our son was about a year old and I started going to church,” he said. “And she said, ‘You know, this isn’t really my thing and I don’t have a background in this, but there’s something about becoming Christian that’s really good for you.’” Vance was raised loosely Christian and was baptized Roman Catholic in 2019. His wife, Usha, was raised Hindu. In her address to the RNC that week, Usha Vance talked about meeting her husband in law school and learning about their starkly contrasting childhoods: hers in a close-knit home in California as the daughter of immigrants from India, and his, in a struggling, working-class family in Ohio. “That JD and I could meet at all, let alone fall in love and marry, is a testament to this great country,” she said. In the past, most of America’s presidents and vice presidents — along with their spouses — have been Christians — and most of them, Protestant; President Biden is only the second Roman Catholic to hold the highest office. “The first thing that comes to mind is how remarkable this would have been 30 years ago, 50 years ago — it may have even been a dealbreaker,” explained Robert P. Jones, president and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute, and author of books including The End of White Christian America. Jones says the country’s changing demographics are reshaping the way people see religious differences. Americans are becoming less religious overall. The country is also becoming more racially and culturally diverse. It’s all led to what Jones describes as a “lowering of barriers” to interfaith marriage. “The stigma has come down and I think the increasing diversity of the country [creates] an opportunity to meet, fall in love with, and marry someone outside your faith,” Jones said. According to the Public Religion Research Institute, nearly 1 in 5 partnered Americans say their spouse or partner has a different religion from their own. Jones says people married since the year 2000 are about three times more likely to be in interfaith relationships as those married before 1960. Gaston Espinosa, a religious studies professor at Claremont McKenna College who writes about religion and the presidency, says American politics have slowly become more open to religious diversity. Espinosa points to the Republican Party’s nomination of Mitt Romney, a Mormon, in 2012, and then Vice President Al Gore’s selection of Sen. Joe Lieberman, who was Jewish, as his running mate for the Democratic ticket in 2000. “Since that time, there's been, I think, a lot of movement in this direction toward recognizing good people — no matter what their religious or racial ethnic background is — to come together to promote the common good for the nation,” Espinosa said. The Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush is the president of Interfaith Alliance, and the great grandson of both Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish Supreme Court justice, and a Baptist theologian. Raushenbush notes that Harris also grew up in a family with a blended cultural and religious heritage — with a Jamaican father and a South Asian mother. “She's coming into an interfaith relationship already understanding what it means to celebrate within a marriage two faith traditions that do not need to be at odds,” he said. “I think that's the message for the country, which is, these different traditions — all of our different traditions — do not need to be and should not be and must not be pitted against one another,” he added. Harris and Emhoff have publicly celebrated a variety of religious holidays, including Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights. Last year, to honor the Jewish High Holy Day Rosh Hashanah, Harris and Emhoff hosted a reception at their official residence, where a mezuzah, a small scroll, is mounted to the front doorway in accordance with Jewish tradition. Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, has worked with Emhoff on a White House initiative to fight antisemitism and other types of extremism. She was there last year as the couple celebrated the holiday together. “That is meaningful to see,” she says. “It’s personal. It is something that we have not seen a lot of in the highest levels of power in this country.”","""What is the current political stance of Jewish Republicans regarding a Christian vice president in the United States?""",False,False,True
"""There was excitement. Now, there’s none: How Harris’ candidacy has demoralized plans for the DNC""","12 misleading or lacking-in-context claims from Harris’ DNC speech  Domenico Montanaro Vice President Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, made 12 misleading or lacking-in-context statements during her speech at the Democratic National Convention last week. There were about a dozen statements that Vice President Kamala Harris made during her roughly 40-minute acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago that were either misleading or lacking in context. They range from characterizations of former President Trump’s stances on abortion rights and Social Security to her plans to address housing and grocery prices. It’s the role of the press to try and hold politicians to account for the accuracy of their statements in a good-faith way. The dozen Harris statements lacking in context are far less in comparison to 162 misstatements, exaggerations and outright lies that NPR found from Trump’s hour-long news conference Aug. 8. Nonetheless, here’s what we found from Harris’ convention speech: 1. “His explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy.”  Trump has promised retribution against his political enemies, has called reporters “the enemy of the people,” and has made vague threats of jail time for reporters. “They’ll never find out, & it’s important that they do,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform after the leak of a draft of the Dobbs decision was published. “So, go to the reporter & ask him/her who it was. If not given the answer, put whoever in jail until the answer is given. You might add the editor and publisher to the list.” He’s made other such comments, but there’s no explicit and specific policy from Trump on this because, as with many things involving Trump, he has been vague about his specific intentions. 2. “[W]e know and we know what a second Trump term would look like. It's all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisers. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past.”  Project 2025 is the work of people with close ties to Trump through the Heritage Foundation. Trump has disavowed parts of Project 2025, and a campaign official called it a “pain in the ass.” There’s good political reason for that. Many of the detailed proposals are highly controversial and unpopular. The website for Project 2025 lays out some of the connections to the Trump administration in black and white, as well as the group’s belief that a Trump administration will use it as a blueprint:“The 2025 Presidential Transition Project is being organized by the Heritage Foundation and builds off Heritage’s longstanding ‘Mandate for Leadership,’ which has been highly influential for presidential administrations since the Reagan era. Most recently, the Trump administration relied heavily on Heritage’s “Mandate” for policy guidance, embracing nearly two-thirds of Heritage’s proposals within just one year in office. “Paul Dans, former chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) during the Trump administration, serves as the director of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project. Spencer Chretien, former special assistant to the president and associate director of Presidential Personnel, serves as associate director of the project.” In fact, CNN reported that “at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025,” including his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and adviser Stephen Miller. What’s more, CBS News found at least 270 policy proposals that intersect with the about 700 laid out in Project 2025. 3. “We're not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare.”  Former President Trump has pledged not to cut Social Security, the popular retirement program. While he was in office, Trump did try, unsuccessfully, to cut benefits for people who receive disability payments from Social Security. Social Security benefits could be cut within a decade anyway, unless Congress takes steps to shore up the program. With tens of millions of baby boomers retiring and starting to draw benefits, and fewer people in the workforce paying taxes for each retiree, Social Security is expected to run short of cash in 2033. If that happens, almost 60 million retirees and their families would automatically see their benefits cut by 21%. The problem could be solved by raising taxes, reducing benefits or some combination of the two. – Scott Horsley, NPR chief economics correspondent 4. “We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare for our children in America.” This is again tied to Project 2025, but not something Trump has specifically talked about. Trump has talked about shutting down the Department of Education, but Head Start is funded through the Department of Health and Human Services. 5. “[A]s president, I will bring together labor and workers and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like healthcare and housing and groceries.” High supermarket prices are a common complaint. Although grocery prices have largely leveled off, rising just 1.1% in the 12 months ending in July, they jumped 3.6% the previous year and a whopping 13.1% the year before that. Vice President Harris has proposed combating high grocery prices with a federal ban on “price gouging,” but her campaign has offered no specifics on how that would work or what would constitute excessive prices. The Biden-Harris administration has previously blamed some highly concentrated parts of the food chain – such as meat-packers – for driving up prices. The administration has tried to promote more competition in the industry by bankrolling new players. – Scott Horsley 6. “And we will end America's housing shortage.” The U.S. faces a serious shortage of housing, which has led to high costs. The average home sold last month for $422,600. Last week, Harris proposed several steps to encourage construction of additional housing, including tax breaks intended to promote 3 million new units in four years. (For context, the U.S. is currently building about 1.5 million homes per year, including just over a million single family homes.) Harris has also proposed $25,000 in downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers and a $40 billion fund to help communities develop affordable housing. She has not said where the money for these programs would come from. – Scott Horsley 7. “He doesn't actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to $5 trillion to the national debt.” While the 2017 tax cuts were skewed to the wealthy, it did cut taxes across the board. Large parts of that tax cut are due to expire next year. Trump has proposed extending all of them, and while also calling for additional, unspecified tax cuts. Harris has proposed extending the tax cuts for everyone making less than $400,000 a year (97% of the population) while raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Under the Biden-Harris administration, the IRS has also beefed up tax enforcement to ensure that wealthier people and businesses pay what they owe. GOP lawmakers have criticized that effort, and it would likely be reversed in a second Trump administration. Both Harris and Trump have proposed exempting tips from taxation. While popular with workers in the swing state of Nevada, where many people work in tip-heavy industries like casinos, the idea has serious problems. Unless the lost tax revenue were replaced somehow, it would create an even bigger budget deficit. It would treat one class of workers (tipped employees) differently from all other workers. And it would invite gamesmanship as other workers tried to have part of their own income reclassified as tax-free tips. Depending on how the exemptions were structured, it could also result in lower retirement benefits for tipped workers. – Scott Horsley 8. “And all the while he intends to enact what, in effect, is a national sales tax? Call it a Trump tax that would raise prices on middle class families by almost $4,000 a year.” This appears to be a reference to tariffs. Donald Trump raised tariffs sharply while he was in office, and he’s pledged to go further if he returns to the White House. During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, washing machines, solar panels and numerous products from China. Many trading partners retaliated, slapping tariffs of their own on U.S. exports. Farmers and manufacturers suffered. Despite the fallout, the Biden/Harris administration has left most of the Trump tariffs in place, while adding its own, additional levies on targeted goods from China such as electric vehicles. In a second term, Trump has proposed adding a 10% tariff on all imports, with a much higher levy on all Chinese goods. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate such import taxes would cost the average family $1,700 a year. – Scott Horsley 9. “This is what's happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand he is not done as a part of his agenda. He and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban with or without Congress. And get this, get this – he plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.” It is accurate to point out that the lack of abortion access across the country for millions of women particularly in the South is directly because of Trump and his decision to appoint three conservative justices to the Supreme Court who voted to overturn Roe. As president, he sided with employers, who for religious or moral reasons, didn’t want to pay for contraception, as he tried to change the mandate that contraception be paid for under the Affordable Care Act. But it’s unclear what Trump will do again as president. He has made conflicting comments about access to contraception. Harris’s charges about an “agenda” again seem to be based on the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. It would be accurate to warn that it’s possible, if not likely, Trump would take up the recommendations given that people close to Trump were instrumental in writing it and given that in his first term as president, he adopted many of the Heritage Foundation’s recommendations. But it’s not entirely accurate to say “he plans to create” these things when Trump himself and his campaign have not advocated for this. Trump himself has said that abortion should be left up to the states – and insisted that he doesn’t support a national ban. 10. “With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.” This is another one of those traps politicians fall into – overpromising when it’s not something they can control. Harris needs Congress to do this, and her winning the presidency does not guarantee that any of what she wants done legislatively will get done, even if Democrats take control of both chambers. 11. “Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades.” While Donald Trump stood in the way of this bill passing, and it had been written with conservative Republicans, it’s not accurate to say this was the “strongest border bill in decades” unless you count 11 years as decades. The 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that got 68 votes in the Senate and was killed by the GOP House, did far more than this bill did. 12. “He encouraged Putin to invade our allies, said Russia could quote, do whatever the hell they want.” While an alarming thing for an American president to say about a NATO ally, this is lacking in some context. Trump said he would say Russia could “do whatever the hell it wanted” – and Trump would not defend an ally – if that country didn’t “pay.” Trump continues to get wrong, however, that no countries in the alliance “pay” anything to anyone except themselves. What Trump is talking about is NATO countries’ goals of funding their own defense to 2% of their gross domestic product. But not defending a country from a hostile invasion would violate Article 5 of the 1949 treaty that binds the countries in battle and was created as a way to thwart any potential efforts by the former Soviet Union to expand beyond its borders. It reads: “[I]f a NATO Ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked.” It has been invoked once: After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S.","""What evidence supports the claim that Harris' candidacy has demoralized plans for the DNC?""",False,False,True

"""JD Vance’s Democratic opponents criticize Trump’s running mate, claiming Ohio governor lacks representation for the next generation of GOP voters.""","Trump-Vance Is Making Something Very Clear About Trumpism  ADVERTISEMENT  GUEST ESSAY By Noah Millman Mr. Millman has written extensively about politics, policy and culture and is the author of the newsletter Gideon’s Substack. Since his selection as Donald Trump’s running mate, Senator JD Vance has performed poorly on most metrics by which we judge vice-presidential nominees. He has never been noted for his charisma, and his attacks and insults have rendered him exceptionally unpopular. But he was not picked for traditional political reasons, like electoral strength in a swing state or being the ambassador to a needed voting bloc. It may be hard to recall after weeks of talk about “cat ladies,” but Mr. Vance, as much as virtually anyone else in Mr. Trump’s orbit, has tried to put ideological and policy meat on the MAGA bones. Mr. Vance was positioned to be MAGA’s overseer of the so-called deep state, the one who would make sure that, this time around, things would really change. Whether or not he became Mr. Trump’s heir, he would make sure that there would be a Trumpism beyond Mr. Trump. But can there be a Trumpism beyond Mr. Trump? The idea — which appeals to many on the right who agree with the Trumpist turn on immigration, trade and foreign policy but also see Mr. Trump’s unfitness for office — may be an impossible dream in principle and not only because of Mr. Trump’s practical inescapability. Mr. Trump’s persona has been the essence of his appeal — his policies matter more for the way they create and sustain that persona than they do for their substantive impact. It is intimately bound up with his anti-institutional posturing, his claim to be the one man who can defeat the system. That is a very difficult thing to institutionalize or even to hand off to a successor. ADVERTISEMENT Indeed, some of the most institutionally destabilizing aspects of populism — its resort to demagoguery, its threats to liberal norms and its association with corruption — may be inseparable from its core appeal. Populism’s essential criticism is that the apparently neutral forms of liberal government have been hijacked by a class of self-serving elites that are alien to the people from whom, under our Constitution, the government derives its legitimate authority. Right-wing populists tend to emphasize the cultural alienation of that elite class, while left-wing populists highlight its plutocratic remove. But they have a common remedy: a champion who, in the name of the people, will drive those elites from their positions of power and influence and restore a government of the people, by the people and for the people. For that very reason, populist movements from Brazil and Mexico to France and Italy to Turkey and India have been led by charismatic leaders whose authority derives from them personally and not from institutions — because only such a leader can plausibly posture as such a champion. In government, a populist leader must continue to operate on the basis of that personal authority. If elites have entrenched themselves in apparently neutral forms of government, then by definition, those structures will be in the populist’s cross hairs. Civil service protections and the procedural niceties of administrative law, for example, are ways that the corrupt system can frustrate the will of the people in favor of the permanent interests of the elites. It’s only logical, therefore, that Mr. Trump has long wanted to reclassify tens of thousands of government workers as Schedule F employees, who can be fired at will (he tried to implement this policy during his final months in office through an executive order), and that Mr. Vance has said Mr. Trump should defy the Supreme Court if it stands in the way of his policy goals. Removing these guardrails on presidential will opens up obvious opportunities for cronyism and corruption; that’s why civil service protections and the procedures of administrative law were adopted in the first place, as good-government reforms. From a populist perspective, though, this may be a feature rather than a bug. Yet corruption is a useful lever for maintaining personal control over the operation of a sprawling bureaucracy, for example. That’s one reason that corruption is endemic in authoritarian regimes. Mr. Trump’s enthusiasm for tariffs, which presidents have a great deal of latitude to both impose and issue waivers from, and for a more discretionary, personalized approach to antitrust have a similar populist rationale. And those are similarly destructive of any kind of neutral institutionalism. His proposals would give the executive branch a lot of power over the economic fates of specific businesses and sectors. That’s a recipe for personal corruption and for rampant economic distortion — but it’s also a means to enforce administration policy through the private sector without going through the grinding work of drafting and passing legislation. ADVERTISEMENT Once those good-government guardrails are down, of course, the opposition will be equally empowered, should it win an election. This creates the condition for a permanent elevation of the electoral stakes. That, in turn, increases the incentive to corrupt the electoral process — as well as the need for a leader who is a successful demagogue capable of speaking as the voice of the people, whatever the electoral outcome. All of this operates against the possibility of true institutionalization or even of succession. This is not just a problem for right-wing versions of populism. In Mexico, the charismatic left-wing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been succeeded by his more technocratic deputy, Claudia Sheinbaum. Without his personal authority, she will have a harder time performing the balancing act that he did of keeping elite interests at bay and satisfying them quietly behind the scenes. She will also have a harder time getting away with flouting liberal norms, as he did, or surviving their restoration. Nor can she forget that other successors of populist leaders — like Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, who succeeded Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — have been felled by corruption scandals that originated in their predecessors’ administrations. Populism, ultimately, is not a politics capable of governing well or even one focused on trying. It not only is prone to demagoguery and corruption but also depends on them to operate. This is why, where populism has achieved a kind of institutionalization — for example, in Argentina under Juan Perón — the long-term results have proved disastrous. Populism is better understood as a kind of immune reaction within a democracy, a warning to more institutionally oriented parties that they have lost an essential connection with their electorate — culturally, economically or both. The way to institutionalize the populist criticism, then, is not to try to institutionalize populism as Mr. Vance seems to have been selected to do. Rather, the more institutional parties must co-opt populism’s most potent policy prescriptions and its most popular cultural positions in order to restore trust in the system itself and stand against the kind of routine elite self-dealing that populism feeds on. ADVERTISEMENT To some degree, the Biden administration has done this on a variety of fronts. Mr. Trump relentlessly attacked free trade with China for hollowing out American industry, but through the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and other initiatives, President Biden has achieved far more in the way of industrial policy than his predecessor ever attempted. Mr. Biden also belatedly tackled the asylum crisis through tough executive orders and a bipartisan border bill that Mr. Trump opposed for political reasons. These initiatives, though, have not yet won Mr. Biden — or Kamala Harris — that much credit because they are still seen by many as representatives of a system that has failed, a system that only populists can credibly promise to overthrow. Mr. Trump’s primary victory suggests that the same systemic distrust is driving Republicans. For either party to quell the populist fever, they need more than policy victories, and less than permanent revolution. They need to rebuild public trust that the system they represent can and will serve the people. That’s easier said than done. But the alternative isn’t an institutionalized populist system of government. It’s a state of continual crisis and democratic decay, regardless of which party is in power.

"""House Freedom Caucus leader denies Virginia primary loss to Trump-supported rival amid recount claims""","A recount Thursday confirmed that Virginia Rep. Bob Good, the chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, lost the 5th District Republican primary to a state lawmaker more than a month ago. Good was challenging certified election results that The Associated Press reported found state Sen. John McGuire beat Good by 374 votes in the June 18 primary. The recount narrowed the margin to 370 votes, AP reported. As recently as Tuesday, Good complained on X about McGuire’s lack of concern about unsecured ballot dropboxes, but late Thursday he acknowledged his loss in a post on Facebook that thanked those who voted for him. “While I am disappointed in the ultimate outcome, it has been my distinct honor to serve as the congressional representative for Virginia’s 5th District,” he wrote, citing the number of constituent service cases handled and legislative efforts. The post did not mention McGuire. McGuire is almost certain to join the House next year, as voters in the 5th District tend to vote Republican by a wide margin. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race as Solid Republican. The AP called the race for McGuire following recount results from a circuit court. McGuire launched a challenge after Good was among the eight House members who voted in October to oust Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as House speaker. Good also endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential bid, which drew the ire of former President Donald Trump. Trump endorsed McGuire and sharply went after Good, who shifted to Trump after DeSantis dropped out of the Republican presidential primary.  It wasn’t enough. Trump called Good “bad for Virginia,” and McGuire made “TRUMP ENDORSED” almost as large as his own name on campaign signs.  McGuire was elected to the state Senate last year, and launched his challenge to Good just a week after he was elected. A retired Navy SEAL, he previously served in the state House of Delegates and ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2020 and 2022.  While Good had support from his Freedom Caucus colleagues, several other House Republicans backed McGuire, even traveling to the district to appear with the challenger. One Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, bucked the group’s leader and endorsed McGuire.  Good and McGuire each raised about $1.2 million, according to the latest reports to the Federal Election Commission, through May 29. Outside groups also spent about $10.3 million, with about 57 percent going to help McGuire and 43 percent for Good. Although the AP didn’t officially call the race until after the recount results, Republicans appeared ready to move on to McGuire. He appeared with Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican nominee for vice president, on July 22.  Good has said he would step down as Freedom Caucus chair if he lost the recount, although it wasn’t immediately clear who would take over the role.  Going into the recount, Good was trailing by 0.6 percentage points, and state law says candidates trailing by more than 0.5 points have to pay for the cost of a recount if they request one and do not ultimately win.","""Did the House Freedom Caucus leader confirm the loss in the Virginia primary to a Trump-supported rival amid recount claims?""",False,False,True

"""Uncertain move: Naidu govt considers erasing Jagan portraits from border stones, identity cards""","Not cast in stone: Naidu govt mulls over removing Jagan images from boundary markers, passbooks  During the recently concluded Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, the state Land Titling Act became a flashpoint between the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), with the former claiming that the system before the Land Tilling Act came into effect led to land encroachment under the previous regime and the TDP accusing the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led party of using the Act to grab land and property without the proper documents. After the N Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP alliance came to power, the new state government fulfilled its poll promise and repealed the Land Titling Act on July 24. Now, the Naidu government is contemplating removing Jagan Mohan Reddy’s photographs from the land boundary marker stones that were fixed during land surveys and from lakhs of land ownership passbooks issued as part of the Act. Naidu told the Assembly this week that the government would reissue the pattadar passbooks with only the official state seal. “The Jagan government wasted Rs 15 crore for printing his photos on the passbooks. The state government, as promised during the electioneering and as per the demand of the people, has decided to issue passbooks with the official seal. Officers have already submitted a copy of the passbook carrying the official seal,” said the CM. However, the TDP government is at a loss over what to do with approximately 77 lakh boundary stones with Jagan’s photo carved on them that revenue officials had planted. After the TDP stormed back to power, many farmers and landowners ripped out the stones, mostly because they disputed the land markings. The TDP’s Revenue Minister Anagani Satya Prasad claimed over 80% of land and property owners were unhappy with the YSRCP surveys and had initiated litigation. “We will be holding ‘gram sabhas’ in over 7,000 villages to ascertain if the land had been marked properly or not, and in consultations with the villagers, will conduct a resurvey if necessary and mark the boundaries accordingly,” he added. TDP ministers also alleged the Jagan government spent over Rs 600 crore to procure the boundary stones and carve the former CM’s image on them. “Though the Centre has never mentioned the issue of laying stones in the directions for the survey, Jagan prepared granite stones only for carving his pictures,” Satya Prasad said. Officials said that the exercise to re-issue land title passbooks without Jagan’s photograph, and the removal of the boundary stones with Jagan’s carving might cost up to Rs 15 crore. “The lakhs of granite stones that will be removed will be used for other purposes,” an official said. YSRCP spokesperson and former minister Ambati Rambabu accused the TDP and Naidu of levelling false allegations. “The land survey was done very scientifically and involved technology that ensured very precise marking of lands. The TDP had originally supported the YSRCP’s land survey but made a U-turn and opposed it. Even now, they are backtracking from their opposition by saying that they will conduct a re-survey, which means it will be a continuation of what the YSRCP government started,” he said. In October 2020, after the NITI Aayog, the Centre’s policy think tank, recommended the implementation of the Land Titling Act in all states, Andhra Pradesh became one of the first states to conduct land surveys to implement it. As per the now-repealed Act, all land and immovable property must be compulsorily registered with government agencies that will then issue permanent titles for them. The Act also provided a new system for speedy property dispute resolution by establishing tribunals. After the Act was rolled out, several property owners raised objections to the method of surveying lands using drones and geotagging, which resulted in discrepancies and disputes. During the election campaign, Naidu and ally JanaSena Party chief K Pawan Kalyan alleged that the YSRCP wanted to usurp land under the Act. In his public meetings, Naidu said the process of land surveys was full of discrepancies and that the people involved were not technically qualified to conduct such surveys.

"""Mamata, films, politics: How Bengal CM again lost control over Tollywood""","Has politics hijacked Kolkata people's protest?  Listen to Story It's been 18 days since the rape-murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, and the protests show no signs of subsiding. It was a natural outpouring of angst and anger which found an immediate trigger in the RG Kar case. People concerned over their safety and fearing that the accused would be shielded, flooded the streets. Much has changed since then. The protests began a fortnight ago. Since then, Kolkata has seen regular protests. Are the protesters common people who are just demanding justice, and who exactly are they protesting against? Have the protests in recent days been hijacked by political parties? The question is of the utmost importance as a newly formed, unregistered students' body -- Paschimbanga Chhatra Samaj -- marches towards Nabanna, the West Bengal secretariat, demanding Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's resignation.  While the protesting people sought justice for the trainee doctor and a better law and order situation in the state, there was no call for Mamata Banerjee's ouster by them. This is a new demand, which also shows that the protest has taken a political turn. Some of the people who have been protesting for justice told IndiaToday.In, that political parties have played a role in providing momentum to the organic protests. They also said that as days progressed, the opposition parties, like the BJP and the CPI(M), have positioned themselves at the forefront of the protests. Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress has claimed the protests to be political.  ""There's an organised campaign being run by BJP by trending 'Mamata Must Resign'. Genuine protestors have now been replaced by BJYM & BJP workers on the streets of Kolkata. In their own words: the ONLY agenda is toppling the Govt,"" TMC MP Saket Gokhale said. There's ""a sinister toolkit"" was at play, the Rajya Sabha MP alleged.   This isn't completely true. However, it would also be incorrect to rule out a role of the Opposition in the recent agitation in West Bengal. To assess the validity of the TMC's claims and for a nuanced understanding of the Kolkata protests, IndiaToday.In spoke to various Kolkata-based people involved in the protests, including a Tollywood actor, an internet celebrity, an academic, and a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha leader. The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) is the youth wing of the BJP.  ""People of Bengal are protesting, demanding quick and fair justice for the RG Kar rape victim. But the protest is not about just one incident. Probably, the long-due anger in people is coming out. And this is the outburst that you are seeing,"" popular content creator and author Indrajit Lahiri tells IndiaToday.In. Tollywood actor Anuradha Mukherjee has beren protesting vigorously since August 14, when women poured out to 'Reclaim the Night'. ""As a working woman I was affected by the RG Kar incident. It was not a call by any organisation or any party, it was my call that I have to join as a citizen of the city,"" Anuradha Mukherjee tells IndiaToday.In. ""Even when I have to shoot at night, there's always uncertainty. You never know what might happen to anyone,"" she adds, revealing the fear of working women in Bengal. What is interesting is that the protesters earlier had been demanding speedy justice in the RG Kar case and women's safety in the state. ""I had never witnessed an incident like this before, and perhaps that's why thousands took to the streets in protest,"" Mukherjee says, pointing to how the protests were organic in the initial days. ""The protest is undoubtedly organic because it has brought together school and college students, university students, the general public, and even people from Tollywood. This level of participation can't happen unless it comes from a deep sense of conviction,"" she adds. Bengal BJYM Vice President Aroon Shah too says the protests have been organic, citing the participation of people from across professions and strata in them. ""Men and women from all walks of life took to the streets across West Bengal. In fact, the state administration is busy sending show cause letters to school principals who have allowed their students and teachers to take out protests seeking justice for ‘Abhaya’,"" Shah tells IndiaToday.In. ""East Bengal and Mohun Bagan supporters who are arch rivals on the field came together and protested against this incident. The police lathicharged them but the protests continued. Such a display of unity among the people remains unseen heretofore,"" says Shah.  None of the protesters have any doubt about the role of political parties or the mileage they have tried to gain from the popular anger against the Mamata Banerjee government. ""It's inevitable that in such a large movement, there will be some political involvement. We can't deny that,"" says actor Mukherjee. ""When a movement rises against a government, political parties are bound to play a role, whether positive or negative — that only time will tell. There's definitely a political side to it."" Garga Chatterjee, a faculty member at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, and general secretary of pro-Bengali advocacy group Bangla Pokkho, makes it clear that several political parties and civil society organisations are playing a key role in the protests now. ""The protests have been both organic and organised. Some of it is organic, and it peaked on the night of August 14. Since then, the proportion of protests tied to political parties has been increasing and the organic proportion has been decreasing,"" Chatterjee tells IndiaToday.In. People have realised this and tried to keep their movement apolitical as far as possible. ""Political parties probably have tried joining. But this time, common people are trying to stop them from doing so. This is purely a people’s movement,"" says influencer Indrajit Lahiri, aka Foodka.  An example would be how the West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front, an outfit of medicos from across West Bengal, stayed clear of Tuesday's 'Nabanna March'. Instead, the doctors are planning a massive rally from Shyambazar to Dharmatala in central Kolkata, on Wednesday. People participating in the rallies have their doubts about the newly floated Paschimbanga Chhatra Samaj being apolitical. ""The protests are almost fully hijacked by political parties or quasi-political organisations as of 26 August,"" Garga Chatterjee tells IndiaToday.In. He cites three telltale signs to prove his point. ""The CPM and the BJP are trying to push the protests towards Mamata Banerjee's resignation. Left groups are trying to call for systemic changes to ensure women's rights and security. Bengali nationalist organisations, like Bangla Pokkho, are trying to push a 'Bengali victim vs Bihari perpetrator' narrative, and pointing to an ethnic pattern in many such recent incidents in West Bengal,"" says Chatterjee. Another South Kolkata resident who didn't want to be named quantified the people-political participation in the protests. ""If the people to political ratio was 70:30 in the beginning, it has reversed to 30:70 now,"" he told IndiaToday, explaining the diminishing participation of people in the protests now.  Following the rape and murder of the trainee doctor, protests erupted at the RG Kar hospital, organised by doctors, after irregularities were found in the response of the college and administration's response. Soon medicos and women's right bodies across West Bengal joined in amplifying the voice of justice. As the protests spread to other cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, a diverse range of voices and people joined the cause. Last week, members of the LGBTQ+ community in Kolkata joined hands to protest over the rape and murder at RG Kar. Days back, a massive group of some 300 drivers from app-based cab services in Kolkata held a rally against the incident. Social media influencers also played a crucial role in amplifying the protests. Protestors from various walks of life organised candle marches, rallies, and sit-ins. However, with each passing day, it might have been difficult to sustain an organic person's movement as the initial shock subsided, and people got busy with their daily lives. Also, there is a growing frustration with the hardship these protests are brining to daily commuters with Kolkata's narrow roads being jammed. ""It's been from August 9 to 27, and still, how much longer? When will our legal system address these issues swiftly? Why is it taking so long? Why can't it be resolved? We are peacefully marching, but for how much longer? How long will we have to wait? I put this question to the government, to the Supreme Court, to everyone,"" says actor Anuradha Mukherjee, expressing the popular frustration over the ""slow probe"". Indrahit Lahiri says the ""single-point demand"" of the people is a solution to the state's law and order situation and the guilty in the RG Kar case to be punished. Mamata Banerjee looks electorally safe for now with the Assembly election far off in 2026. ""This case would have had a big impact closer to the elections,"" says the South Kolkata-based resident, who chose anonymity. With Durga Puja, celebrated with great fanfare in West Bengal, weeks away, whatever remains of the organic protests might fizzle out. ""It is very hard to say where the protests are headed but the absence of an election in the near future as well as Durga Pujo are factors against the long-term sustainability of the present fervour,"" says Garga Chatterjee. Though the protests have taken a different hue and turn now, it must be clear to Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress that people of West Bengal are not going to be mute spectators when it comes to law-and-order issues of the state or justice for women. The initial protests have also revealed how popular anger can spill over to the streets and an authoritarian administration can be pushed on the back foot.","""What are the recent political events involving Mamata Banerjee that have impacted Tollywood?""",False,False,True

"""Yogi's Govt Bill Faces Backlash from Senior UP BJP Leaders, Causing Political Turmoil""","Decode Politics: How a Yogi govt Bill ran into a wall raised by senior UP BJP leaders  In another attempt to project a united front in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP ensured that both its Deputy Chief Ministers in the state were present alongside CM Yogi Adityanath at the Legislature Party meeting convened before the start of the Monsoon Session of the Assembly this week. Days later, that front is again showing cracks. First, the Adityanath government’s Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilization for Public Purposes) Bill ran into objections from the BJP’s own ranks in the Assembly, with City West, Prayagraj, MLA and former minister Sidharth Nath Singh and Prayagraj MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai expressing apprehensions over the legislation. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna even intervened while Bajpai was speaking to appeal: “Aap samajh nahi rahe ho. Pahle padh toh lo (You do not understand the Bill. First, go through it carefully).” BJP ally NISHAD Party’s Anil Tripathi then joined Singh and Bajpai in expressing his misgivings. Then, a day after the Bill cleared the Assembly, the Legislative Council sent it to a Select Committee for further scrutiny. The demand was first made by UP BJP chief and MLC Bhupendra Chaudhary, and supported by Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, who has launched a covert rebellion against Adityanath. While Adityanath in his capacity as CM is the Leader of the BJP in the Assembly, Maurya is the leader of the BJP in the Council. The BJP and allies enjoy a clear majority in both the Houses, which means that it is rare for a Bill to be sent to a Select Committee, that too on a demand made from the Treasury Benches. Nazul land is land originally acquired during the colonial period for specific purposes such as public utilities, administrative functions or for the settlement of displaced individuals. Over time, this land has been used or leased for various public and private purposes. As per the proposed Bill, Nazul land in the state will now be reserved and used exclusively for public purposes. Any court proceedings or applications requesting the transfer of ownership of Nazul land to private individuals or institutions will be cancelled and automatically rejected. In case payments have been made in anticipation of such ownership changes, the amounts are to be refunded. The government could choose to extend the leases of current leaseholders of Nazul land, provided they are in good standing, regularly paying rent, and have not violated lease terms. While BJP leaders as well as the Opposition say they have raised objections to the Bill in “public interest”, the legislation in fact replaces an ordinance that has been in implementation since March this year. The ordinance did not see any significant opposition when it was passed by the Adityanath Cabinet. On Thursday, when Chaudhary proposed that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee, even Opposition members were initially caught off-guard, not knowing how to respond. Even as the latter neither backed nor opposed Chaudhary’s proposal, other BJP leaders expressed their support for Chaudhary, with Maurya indicating it by raising his hand. The other Deputy CM, Brajesh Pathak, was seated next to Maurya in his capacity as minister. He could not vote on the proposal as he is a member of the Assembly and not the Council, but as soon as the decision was taken to send the Bill to the Select Committee, Pathak and Maurya were seen shaking hands. While the Bill saw a discussion in the Assembly on July 31, before it was passed by a voice vote, there was no discussion on it in the Upper House on August 1 before it was sent to the Select Committee. In the Assembly, noting that “governments work in continuation”, Sidharth Nath Singh suggested that those who have been residing on such land for ages and near the end of their lease should be given the opportunity to get an extension. He also suggested that with previous governments alternatively allowing freehold of the land or stopping it, those who continued to pay their instalments after freehold should also be considered. The Indian Express spoke to some members of the Legislative Council, where the Bill saw no discussion. They admitted they had not read the Bill, but added that they knew it would be recommended for Select Committee appraisal as “the public is against the provisions of the Bill”. They could not say what these provisions were. A BJP MLC said: “When the organisational head makes a proposal, we have to follow. He (Chaudhary) is not just a member of the Council but also the head of the state organisation. Even the Leader of our House and Deputy CM Keshav ji supported it. Many people have been approaching us against the provisions as it would displace poor people who have been residing on Nuzul lands for generations… The new law would have given the government the power to take it back at will.” Asked why they did not object when the ordinance was moved, the BJP MLC said he “did not know about that”. “We had to support sending it to the Select Committee, and we did.” About the surprisingly vociferous intervention by BJP MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai on the matter, Prayagraj Mahanagar BJP president Rajendra Mishra said: “Harshvardhan ji is a two-term MLA and always speaks his mind and raises his voice for the people.” He added: “Harshavardhan ji only speaks and works according to the policy and agenda of the party and government.” Bajpai is the grandson of Rajendra Kumar Bajpai, a veteran Congress leader and former Union minister who was seen as close to Indira Gandhi. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav Friday demanded the permanent withdrawal of the “inhuman” Nazul Bill. Taking a swipe at Adityanath in a post on X, Akhilesh said: “The Nazul land issue is entirely a decision to uproot homes because a bulldozer cannot run over every house… What will the BJP gain by demolishing settled homes? Will the BJP render people homeless for the benefit of land mafias?” On Thursday, soon after the Bill was sent to a Select Committee, Akhilesh said the BJP government wanted the law for “the personal benefit” of some people. “There are many such lands in Gorakhpur which some people want to grab to expand their sphere of influence… It is hoped that the Chief Minister will take suo motu cognisance and will not let any such plan succeed, especially in Gorakhpur,” he wrote on X. Gorakhpur is Adityanath’s political turf.

"""Haryana's least-privileged Dalit communities claim 'old life' and demand quota abolition in upcoming session.""","Haryana most-deprived Dalit groups see ‘new life’, want law for quota within quota in current session  Soon after the Supreme Court order Thursday empowering states to go ahead with sub-categorisation within the Scheduled Castes for the purpose of reservations, the ‘Dalit-A Mahapanchayat Haryana’ announced that it would meet Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini to press that a legislation to enforce this be introduced in the ongoing Monsoon Session. Several Dalit groups, excluding those who work in the leather industry, have been seeking quota within the overall 20% SC quota to help them avail the benefits of reservation. The Dalit A Mahapanchayat is one of them. However, the group that works in the leather industry and enjoys a level of affluence has been opposed, saying such a measure would hurt Dalit unity. After Thursday’s order, they said they would be meeting BJP leaders to demand that the status quo be maintained on the issue in Haryana. With the Assembly polls in Haryana coming soon, both sides realise that they can put pressure on parties to concede their demands. Dalit-A Mahapanchayat president Devi Das Valmiki said: “We will hold a big rally if a quota within the SC quota for government jobs is not given before the Assembly polls.” The Dalit A Mahapanchayat also believes it has a strong case because, in March 2020, conceding the demand of Dalit groups like it, the Haryana Assembly had passed a Bill creating a quota within the SC quota for seats in the state’s higher educational institutions for a newly designated “Deprived Scheduled Castes” category. This category includes 36 communities, such as the Valmikis, Bazigars, Sansis, Dehas, Dhanaks and Saperas. The Dalit A Mahapanchayat wants a similar sub-quota now for government jobs. According to government sources, the ‘Deprived Scheduled Castes’ cover almost the entire SC category, which comprises around 11% of the state’s population. Haryana was an interested party in the case before the Supreme Court as in 1994, the then Congress government in the state led by Bhajan Lal had bifurcated the SC quota into two groups – ‘Block A’, comprising the more deprived Dalit groups, and ‘Block B’, comprising the Dalits working in the leather industry. In 2006, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had quashed the 1994 notification, citing the decision of a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the E V Chinnaiah vs State Of Andhra Pradesh And Others case. On Thursday, a seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court overruled this order. Devi Das Valmiki told The Indian Express: “The current BJP government should have implemented the quota within the SC reservation in government jobs too when it introduced one for admission in educational institutions in 2020. After the latest Supreme Court decision, it should be implemented as early as possible, without delay. The ball is now in the court of the state government.” He called the Supreme Court decision a “lifeline” for them. “From 1966 to now, no one from our community has become a Lok Sabha MP from Haryana, even as the state has two seats reserved for SCs.” Devi Das Valmiki claimed that after the 2004 apex court order, “even the graduates or postgraduates from our communities did not get enough employment in the state”. However, the president of the Hisar unit of the ‘Dr B R Ambedkar Sabha’, Raghubir Sunda, termed the Supreme Court order “unfortunate”, warning that it could have “adverse effects for SCs”. “A significant number of government posts out of the 20% set aside for SCs are lying vacant in Haryana with the remark ‘not found a suitable candidate’. The Supreme Court judgment would just increase this backlog for government jobs. More government posts for SCs will fall vacant. Even in educational institutions, the representation of SCs has decreased after the implementation of a quota within the SC quota,” Sunda claimed. He added: “When there is no caste-based census, then how can such a decision be implemented?” Independent voices within SC groups called for unity among community members in “the larger interest”. A Scheduled Caste leader who did not wish to be identified said: “This is the time for unity among SCs for upliftment of the community members.

"""Reservation not needed for all Dalits: Modi govt must delay provision of sub-quotas: SC-ST panel former chief""","Reservation should be for all Dalits … Modi govt must expedite provision of sub-quotas: SC-ST panel former chief  The Narendra Modi government should set the ball rolling to classify the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) into sub-categories for the purpose of distributing the benefits of reservation among the most deprived Dalit and Adivasi communities, BJP leader and former chairman of the erstwhile National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Bizay Sonkar Shastri, has said. Even as other leaders in the BJP whom The Indian Express spoke to said the party would study the recent Supreme Court judgment on the issue before coming up with its view, Shastri welcomed the verdict, saying that those among Dalits opposing it were looking only at the interest of their own communities and not Dalits as a whole. “There should be sub-classification among SCs. Some communities are benefitting the most from reservation while others are not getting any benefit. So, if the quota is sub-categorised, a path will open for reservation benefits reaching those who have not got the benefit of reservation for long,” Shastri, from the Khatik (SC) community in Varanasi, told The Indian Express. Shastri cited the example of the Meenas of Rajasthan, saying they have benefited most from the ST quota, leaving others behind. Shastri was the last chairperson of the National Commission of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the days of Atal Bihari Vajpayee as PM, before the constitutional body was bifurcated in 2004 into the National Commission of Scheduled Castes and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes. Asked about his comments on an array of Dalit leaders, activists and academics who argue that sub-quotas could damage the struggle for Dalit unity, Shastri, a former BJP MP, said, “All this is deceptive talk. I was chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and my view should carry weight. I am saying it upfront that people who talk like this have only their community and not Dalits as a whole in mind. These arguments are bogus and against Dalit interests as a whole. They should not talk like this and ensure that all Dalit communities benefit from reservation.” He added, “Dr Ambedkar once told Govind Ballabh Pant that reservation was not about ability but about redistribution. The country as a whole should feel that it is a stakeholder in running the country. Reservation should be for all Dalits. If only one community corners all benefits, what will happen to the vision of Dr Ambedkar? I demand that the Modi government should expedite the provision of sub-quotas for the benefit of all Dalits,” Shastri said. His party has not taken an official view on the issue yet. Nor is Shastri’s view the only one within it. A Dalit leader in the BJP who comes from the leather-working caste said, on the condition of anonymity, that it was best if the SCs remained a singular entity for the purposes of reservation in the larger interest of SC unity across the country. The government, however, told the Supreme Court that the State should have freedom to offer sub-quotas in order to deepen reservation, by making it trickle down to the most deprived groups. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta made this submission before the Supreme Court, which validated the position in its judgment.

Responding to Union minister Amit Shah’s remark labelling him as the head of the “Aurangzeb Fan Club”, Thackeray claimed that Shah is a “political heir” of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the Afghan ruler who defeated the Marathas in the battle of Panipat. Earlier on July 21, Shah during his Pune visit had attacked the Sena (UBT) chief, saying, “Uddhav Thackeray is the leader of Aurangzeb Fan Club.” Read more: Kerala CM counters Amit Shah's 'early warnings' claim on Wayanad landslides: ‘Red alert issued only after…’ Thackeray accused the BJP, a former ally, of orchestrating splits in political parties, notably the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Referring to a letter from the former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Balasaheb Deoras to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Thackeray pointed out that Deoras emphasised no hatred toward Muslims or non-Hindus and upheld secularism as a valued Hindu trait. Thackeray questioned whether this form of Hindutva was unacceptable to Shah. He claimed that the people of Maharashtra delivered a strong message to Shah during the recent Lok Sabha elections, stating that after campaigning and facing voter backlash, Shah returned to his leaders to assess the political damage. He told his party workers in Pune that, according to the BJP, aligning with Muslims after explaining their version of Hindutva equates to being part of the “Aurangzeb Fan Club” and accused the saffron party of engaging in “power jihad”. The Sena leader claimed that the Eknath Shinde government’s “Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin” scheme was an attempt to bribe voters with freebies. Thackeray also mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demand for accountability from the Congress for its 70-year governance, highlighting that the new parliament building had structural issues within a year of its construction. He urged Modi to address the mismanagement of his government.

BJP leader and deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis criticised Thackeray, calling him “disappointed and frustrated” and suggested that the Sena leader’s remarks were evidence of his unstable state of mind and affiliation with the “Aurangzeb Fan Club”. Commenting on Thackeray’s statement, Maharashtra minister Girish Mahajan said, “I think Uddhav Thackeray has lost his mental balance.

Today, he made wrong comments about the home minister of India Amit Shah...Elections are very far, I don’t know till then what kind of language he will use...”","""What are Uddhav Thackeray's comments on BJP's 'power jihad' claims and his opinion on Amit Shah's leadership?""",False,False,True

File   Photo Credit: PTI NCP (SP) leader Supriya Sule on August 3 responded to Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar's denial of reports about him travelling to Delhi in disguise to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah when he was a opposition leader in Maharashtra and said she never levelled allegations. Mr. Pawar had said he would quit politics if the reports about his Delhi visit before the NCP forged an alliance with the BJP in 2023 were proven, and if not, those raising such allegations should quit politics. ""I never made allegations against anyone. I believe in constructive politics and policy-making. All news channels quoted Ajit Pawar as claiming how he would visit Delhi in disguise under a fake name before splitting NCP, during a media interaction at Sunil Tatkare's house in the national capital,"" Ms. Sule said. She said she was shocked that Mr. Pawar had visited Delhi in disguise to meet Mr. Shah at least “ten times” when he was the opposition leader. “When news channels in Delhi asked me about Ajit Pawar’s claims, I was shocked. I raised the issue of matching facial identification with Aadhaar on the DG app in Lok Sabha during question hour. I did not name any person,” she said. Reports published in a section of the media claimed that during an informal interaction held recently, Mr. Pawar revealed he used to travel to Delhi in disguise and meet Amit Shah on the alliance between the two parties (NCP and BJP). ""I used to wear a mask and a cap during air travel while going to Delhi to attend those meetings. I had also changed my name for air travel,"" reports quoted Mr. Pawar as saying. Latching on to this claim, the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP (SP) leaders targeted Mr. Pawar. However, talking to reporters in Nashik on August 2, Mr. Pawar said he believed in “playing open politics”. ""I am an activist who works in democracy. I don't have the habit of doing politics by hiding anything. However, opponents are targeting us with fake narratives and false news,"" he said. He said his opponents have resorted to such moves as they were shattered due to the good schemes being implemented by the Mahayuti government in Maharashtra. ""The news of me going to Delhi in disguise is false. If I want to go anywhere, I will go openly. There is no need for me to be afraid of anyone.

"""Trump Media shares plummet by 30% following failed assassination attempt""","Trump Media Stock Price Falls To Lowest Level Since Going Public  Donald Trump's media company's stock has fallen to its lowest level since it went public on March 26. Trump Media and Technology Group Corp., which owns the social media platform Truth Social, fell by 68.82 percent on Tuesday. Shares were priced at $17.89 at around midday, according to CNBC, a further drop from the previous low of $19.50 on Friday, according to Forbes. The shares were priced at $79.38 when they came on the stock market in March. The drop in the company's stock, which uses the ticker DJT, means that the former president's net worth is down by $163 million as of Tuesday, equivalent to a 4 percent drop, according to Forbes. Trump's net worth had reportedly dropped to $3.9 billion as of 4.30pm EDT on September 3, according to Forbes. The Republican presidential candidate was not alone in suffering a financial drop. Other social media companies were also affected, including Reddit, which fell by 4 percent, and Snap, which fell by 5 percent, Forbes reported. The market downturn affected all three major U.S. stock indexes, the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, and National Association of Securities Dealers (Nasdaq). Forbes reported that the drop, which mostly impacted tech companies, was triggered by a report from the Institute for Supply Management which showed that manufacturing had slowed for the fifth month in a row in August. Trump's stocks have risen and fallen over the past few months, often coinciding with the GOP nominee's political campaign. When Trump survived a failed assassination attempt on July 13, Trump Media shares experienced a surge of 30 percent at the end of the Monday after the incident, the outlet reported. This is in part because DJT trades more like a meme stock than a traditional financial investment that responds to the real value of a company, CNBC reported. As a result, the former president's net worth has decreased by $900 million since Kamala Harris joined the presidential race after Joe Biden withdrew and publicly endorsed her on July 21, according to CNN. Trump Media, which was valued at $4 billion on July 19, dropped to about $3.1 billion at the start of August, according to the outlet. The company has plans to expand its reach to live-stream TV, according to Forbes. After announcing the company would be going public, Trump joined the list of the world's 500 wealthiest people on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the first time, according to CNN.

But make no mistake: Ukraine can and will stop Putin, especially with our full collective support.” The aid will include new batteries and components for Patriot missile systems, donated by the U.S., Germany, Romania, the Netherlands and other partners. Italy will donate an additional SAMP-T missile system. Speaking from a teleprompter, Biden said that more air defense supplies will be distributed to Ukraine in the coming months. The announcement comes over two years into brutal invasion of Ukraine led by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a war that has become a point of contention on Capitol Hill as lawmakers remain divided on whether to keep providing funds for Ukraine’s defense. Biden’s speech also served as the latest example of the split screen looming over the 2024 NATO summit this week: As the president holds high-stakes meetings with foreign allies, his political future in the U.S. Democratic Party is on the line. The president’s Tuesday remarks were another opportunity for him to assuage Democratic fears about his 2024 candidacy, following his disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump in June. Since then, cracks have emerged within the Democratic Party as some lawmakers, donors and strategists publicly urge Biden to bow out of the race and allow a new nominee to step forward. Earlier Tuesday, House Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., joined the growing tally of Democratic lawmakers officially calling on Biden to drop out. Others have expressed continued support for the president in public statements, while voicing their reservations behind closed doors. Even as some Democrats remain tight-lipped about their concern about the president’s electability, many have openly noted that this week’s NATO summit comes with added pressure given the looming reelection doubts. The summit presents a timely example of Democrats’ heightened anxieties about losing to Trump in November. The former president has said he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the 32-member military alliance if he won a second term. “Americans, they know we’re stronger with our friends and we understand this is a sacred obligation,” Biden said during his NATO speech. Since his June 27 debate fumble, Biden has held several public appearances to try and restore confidence in his candidacy, including a 22-minute interview with ABC News last Friday. So far, his public showings have not put Democrats’ worries to rest. “The president needs to engage in the kind of interaction with voters that will prove to those that are skeptical out there that he can do the job,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a Sunday broadcast interview about the week ahead. “If he can’t do that, then he has a decision to make.” Biden is scheduled to hold a solo press conference on Thursday evening, a highly anticipated opportunity for him to prove that he can carry on an exchange with reporters in an unscripted environment.

"""Iran's conservative leader wins landslide victory, sweeping away reformist hopes for immediate change""","Ebrahim Raisi wins Iran's presidential election in landslide victory amid historically low voter turnout  Watch CBS News Updated on: June 19, 2021 / 7:21 PM EDT / CBS/AP Iran's hard-line judiciary chief won the country's presidential election in a landslide victory Saturday, propelling the supreme leader's protege into Tehran's highest civilian position in a vote that appeared to see the lowest turnout in the Islamic Republic's history. Initial results showed Ebrahim Raisi won 17.8 million votes in the contest, dwarfing those of the race's sole moderate candidate. However, Raisi dominated the election only after a panel under the watch of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei disqualified his strongest competition. His candidacy, and the sense the election served more as a coronation for him, sparked widespread apathy among eligible voters in the Islamic Republic, which has held up turnout as a sign of support for the theocracy since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Some, including former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, called for a boycott. CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports there's another reason turnout may be low: An online campaign urging people not to vote. It's a protest against Iran's rigged political system, which only allowed seven men to run for the presidency — all of them from within the ruling establishment, and five of them conservative hardliners. Three dropped out the day before the vote. In initial results, former Revolutionary Guard commander Mohsen Rezaei won 3.3 million votes and moderate Abdolnasser Hemmati got 2.4 million, said Jamal Orf, the head of Iran's Interior Ministry election headquarters. The race's fourth candidate, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, had around 1 million votes, Orf said. Hemmati offered his congratulations on Instagram to Raisi early Saturday. ""I hope your administration provides causes for pride for the Islamic Republic of Iran, improves the economy and life with comfort and welfare for the great nation of Iran,"" he wrote. On Twitter, Rezaei praised Khamenei and the Iranian people for taking part in the vote. ""God willing, the decisive election of my esteemed brother, Ayatollah Dr. Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi, promises the establishment of a strong and popular government to solve the country's problems,"" Rezaei wrote. The quick concessions, while not unusual in Iran's previous elections, signaled what semiofficial news agencies inside Iran had been hinting at for hours: That the carefully controlled vote had been a blowout win for Raisi amid the boycott calls. As night fell Friday, turnout appeared far lower than in Iran's last presidential election in 2017. At one polling place inside a mosque in central Tehran, a Shiite cleric played soccer with a young boy as most of its workers napped in a courtyard. At another, officials watched videos on their mobile phones as state television blared beside them, offering only tight shots of locations around the country - as opposed to the long, snaking lines of past elections. Balloting came to a close at 2.a.m. Saturday, after the government extended voting to accommodate what it called ""crowding"" at several polling places nationwide. Paper ballots, stuffed into large plastic boxes, were to be counted by hand through the night, and authorities said they expected to have initial results and turnout figures Saturday morning at the earliest. ""My vote will not change anything in this election, the number of people who are voting for Raisi is huge and Hemmati does not have the necessary skills for this,"" said Hediyeh, a 25-year-old woman who gave only her first name while hurrying to a taxi in Haft-e Tir Square after avoiding the polls. ""I have no candidate here."" Iranian state television sought to downplay the turnout, pointing to the Gulf Arab sheikhdoms surrounding it ruled by hereditary leaders, and the lower participation in Western democracies. After a day of amplifying officials' attempts to get out the vote, state TV broadcast scenes of jam-packed voting booths in several provinces overnight, seeking to portray a last-minute rush to the polls. But since the 1979 revolution overthrew the shah, Iran's theocracy has cited voter turnout as a sign of its legitimacy, beginning with its first referendum that won 98.2% support that simply asked whether or not people wanted an Islamic Republic. The disqualifications affected reformists and those backing Rouhani, whose administration both reached the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and saw it disintegrate three years later with then-President Donald Trump's unilateral withdrawal of America from the accord. Voter apathy also has been fed by the devastated state of the economy and subdued campaigning amid months of surging coronavirus cases. Poll workers wore gloves and masks, and some wiped down ballot boxes with disinfectants. Palmer reports Iran's economy, battered by U.S. sanctions, endemic corruption and then the coronavirus pandemic, has withered, and the price of basic goods has skyrocketed. The price of chicken, for example, has more than doubled in just 10 years.   Raisi would be  the first serving Iranian president sanctioned by the U.S. government even before entering office over his involvement in the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988, as well as his time as the head of Iran's internationally criticized judiciary - one of the world's top executioners. It also puts hard-liners firmly in control across the government as negotiations in Vienna continue to try to save a tattered deal meant to limit Iran's nuclear program at a time when Tehran is enriching uranium at its highest levels ever, though it still remains short of weapons-grade levels. Tensions remain high with both the U.S. and Israel, which is believed to have carried out a series of attacks targeting Iranian nuclear sites as well as assassinating the scientist who created its military atomic program decades earlier. © 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

The election was called early following the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi, and took place amid heightened regional tensions and domestic discontent. Issued on: 06/07/2024 - 05:21 Modified: 06/07/2024 - 07:17  Iran's reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday won a runoff presidential election against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, the interior ministry said. Pezeshkian received more than 16 million votes and Jalili more than 13 million out of about 30 million votes cast, electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said, adding that voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent. The number of spoiled ballots was reported to be over 600,000. Pezeshkian thanked his supporters who came to vote ""with love and to help"" the country. ""We will extend the hand of friendship to everyone; we are all people of this country; we should use everyone for the progress of the country,"" he said on state television. The election, called early after the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, followed a first round marked by a historically low turnout last week. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority, had called for a higher turnout in the runoff, emphasising the importance of the election. He said the first round turnout was lower than expected, but added that it was not an act ""against the system"". The ballot comes against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme, and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy. In last week's first round, Pezeshkian, who was the only reformist allowed to stand, won the largest number of votes, around 42 percent, while Jalili came second with around 39 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority. Read more Who are the men running to become Iran's next president? Only 40 percent of Iran's 61 million eligible voters took part in the first round -- the lowest turnout in any presidential election since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The candidacy of Pezeshkian, a relative unknown until recently, has raised the hopes of Iran's reformists after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps Iran's main reformist coalition supported Pezeshkian, with endorsements by former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, a moderate. Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has called for ""constructive relations"" with Western countries to revive the nuclear deal in order to ""get Iran out of its isolation"". Jalili, 58, is Iran's former nuclear negotiator who is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance. Daily newsletter Receive essential international news every morning During his campaign, he rallied a substantial base of hardline supporters and received backing from other conservative figures. Ahead of Friday's runoff, Pezeshkian and Jalili took part in two televised debates during which they discussed the low turnout, as well as Iran's economic woes, international relations and internet restrictions. Pezeshkian vowed to ease long-standing internet restrictions and to ""fully"" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory headscarf for women, a high-profile issue since the death in police custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini. The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been detained for an alleged breach of the dress code and her death sparked months of nationwide unrest. (AFP)  © 2024 Copyright France 24 - All rights reserved.

"""India-Bangladesh trade faces stability as Modi's resignation shakes up commerce""","What does Sheikh Hasina’s resignation mean for India-Bangladesh relations?  India views the events in Bangladesh as a setback for security, trade and connectivity and a possible loss of influence. Save articles to read later and create your own reading list. When the deposed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled Dhaka by military helicopter on August 5, following weeks-long deadly protests against her government, there was little doubt about where she was headed. India has supported Hasina and it is where she spent many years in exile after almost her entire family was assassinated in 1975. When Hasina landed at an air force base near New Delhi, she was received by none other than Ajit Doval, the head of the Indian security establishment who oversees the external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), which has been accused of meddling in the internal affairs of Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries. Hasina resigned after weeks-long protests that killed nearly 300 people. She is reportedly seeking asylum in the West and will likely stay in India for “a while”, according to local Indian media. Bangladesh is currently being led by an interim government under Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus. There are already signs of frostiness between the two neighbours in the wake of Hasina’s resignation. Following her departure, non-essential staff from India’s high commission have been withdrawn from Bangladesh, according to local Indian media. The events that led to Hasina’s overthrow are perceived as a major setback for India, which shared strong diplomatic and trade relations with Dhaka under Hasina, and in whom India had invested a lot in recent years. Hasina had been a valuable ally that helped undo – to some extent – the security, logistical and political nightmare created by the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan. After partition, to India’s east lay East Pakistan, later renamed Bangladesh in 1971 after a bloody war of independence led by Hasina’s father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Following the birth of Bangladesh with India’s help, challenges grew for India as the new nation vacillated between a secular democracy and an Islamic republic like Pakistan. India always perceived any shift towards Pakistan’s values as a threat. In the late 1970s, India faced a national security challenge with a Zia on the left and a Zia on the right – meaning Pakistan under General Zia-ul-Haq and Bangladesh led by General Ziaur Rahman. Rahman, who founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), was assassinated in 1981. His wife Khaleda Zia ruled the country sporadically until 2006. It was much to India’s relief when in 2009 Hasina and her Awami League party, which represented a secular democracy where minorities like Hindus, Bangladesh’s largest minority faith, felt protected, came to power. In the last 15 years, Hasina rebuilt roads linking Dhaka with Kolkata and Agartala in India that were severed after 1947. She built bridges, re-established railway links and facilitated easy access of cargo ships on the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries, bringing the two countries closer. Security cooperation increased between India and Bangladesh and Hasina helped India quell rebellion in the northeastern Indian state of Assam by refusing to provide safe refuge to rebels from across the border. Although Hasina had an excellent relationship with China, too, she managed to convey to India that its interests came first. She had recently said, for example, that she preferred India over China for a $1bn river development project. However, what really tightened the relationship between India and Bangladesh was a deal struck between Hasina’s government and the Indian Adani Group in the power sector. The agreement would see Bangladesh receive coal-based power from a $1.7bn plant in Jharkhand, India. But the deal generated unease within the opposition, as Bangladesh would be paying higher tariffs than what it would pay for other sources. Moreover, there was disquiet over the deal as any agreement with Adani was also seen to earn favour with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “It was not a secret to the AL [Awami League] that Adani was closely tied with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a business deal that favours Adani would ultimately bring political favour from Modi to [the] AL government,” Saimum Parvez, research fellow of the department of political science of Vrije University in Brussels, told Al Jazeera in 2023. India, therefore, recognised the importance of securing its precious ally, Hasina, and her government in Dhaka. Back in January, there were allegations of Indian interference in Bangladesh’s elections to keep Hasina in power. Hasina had become increasingly authoritarian, arresting and targeting opposition members, and cracking down on dissent and free speech. Many observers including the United States said the elections were “not free or fair” given that the main opposition, the BNP, did not participate. When Hasina secured a fifth term in the controversial poll, India, along with Russia and China, congratulated her on her victory. When Bangladesh’s student demonstration against job quotas for the families of freedom fighters turned violent and became a nationwide call for her resignation, the authorities responded with a harsh crackdown. Indian security experts told this journalist on condition of anonymity that the Indian security establishment thought Hasina and her control over the army would ensure that the upheaval would not spin out of control. There had been occasions, however, when India tried to reach out to the opposition so that it was not left on in the cold if Hasina’s government were to be thrown out of office. But according to sources speaking to the Indian Express newspaper, Hasina would not allow any Indian high commissioner to talk to BNP leader Khaleda Zia. Hasina allegedly zealously guarded not just her friends, but also who they spoke to. What many strategic experts on security issues Al Jazeera spoke to, including those in the diplomatic community, were reluctant to say was that much of the harm done to India’s interests was of its own doing. That is, ever since India’s foreign policy was driven by the same forces that are trying to shift India from being a secular constitution-based democracy to one which is guided by the Hindu faith, New Delhi has been losing friends. In 2021, when Modi visited Dhaka, protests against the prime minister erupted leaving at least 12 dead. Bangladeshis were protesting anti-Muslim discrimination in India and policies such as a controversial law which allows a citizenship pathway for minorities but excludes Muslims. “This was the turning point of our relationship with Bangladesh,” a retired intelligence official who did not want to be named said last week. “Local people just got turned off India’s shift away from constitutional secularism.” At the face of it, the biggest worry for the Indian diplomatic establishment would be the return of a right-wing BNP government under Khaleda Zia in Bangladesh that could attempt to marginalise the Awami League. There are fears that such a government could affect the Hindu minority, which accounts for about 8 percent of the country of 170 million and traditionally supports the Awami League. Some Indian news outlets have been pushing claims that Pakistan and China were behind the protests, as well as exaggerating the scale of attacks Hindu minorities have experienced in the wake of the protests. Anti-Muslim coverage has pushed the narrative that Pakistan wants to turn Bangladesh – a Muslim country that upholds secular principles – into an Islamic state. Al Jazeera has independently verified that since Hasina’s removal two Hindus have been killed – a police officer and an Awami League activist – and several Hindu households in the country have been attacked and looted. A Hindu leader told Al Jazeera attacks that have been politically motivated, not communal. Still, there have been numerous reports of attacks targeting Hindu households, temples and businesses. The interim cabinet said its in first official statement on Sunday that attacks “have been noted with grave concern”. It said it would “immediately sit with the representative bodies and other concerned groups to find ways to resolve such heinous attacks”. Student protesters in Bangladesh are trying to prove fears of religious violence unfounded by protecting Hindu temples and houses from being vandalised. Instagram is full of pictures of young students guarding shrines in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. But any violence targeting Hindus would only help the hardliners in India’s governing BJP who may claim vindication that the Hindus and Muslims cannot live together and justify bringing in the citizenship law. India has a lot riding on Bangladesh, including annual trade worth $13bn. The countries were also due to start talks for a free trade agreement. With Hasina now out, India has lost influence in the country and it would prefer for there to be no elections for now. That may not happen with exiled BNP opposition leader Tarique Rahman due to return to Bangladesh, according to his party. “The time-tested diplomatic response to this should be that we are waiting and watching to see how things will develop and to reiterate our friendly sentiments for the people of a close and important neighbour,” Shyam Saran, the former foreign secretary, said writing in the Indian Express newspaper. Indian political parties are largely with the government on this. At an all-party meeting, the government was given a carte blanche for dealing with the situation in Bangladesh.
