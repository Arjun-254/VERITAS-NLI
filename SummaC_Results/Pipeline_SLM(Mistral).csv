Psilocybin temporarily dissolves brain networks,"Psilocybin desynchronizes brain networks  An official website of the United States government   Preview improvements coming to the PMC website in October 2024. Learn More or Try it out now. The relationship between the acute effects of psychedelics and their persisting neurobiological and psychological effects is poorly understood. Here, we tracked brain changes with longitudinal precision functional mapping in healthy adults before, during, and for up to 3 weeks after oral psilocybin and methylphenidate (17 MRI visits per participant) and again 6+ months later. Psilocybin disrupted connectivity across cortical networks and subcortical structures, producing more than 3-fold greater acute changes in functional networks than methylphenidate. These changes were driven by desynchronization of brain activity across spatial scales (area, network, whole brain). Psilocybin-driven desynchronization was observed across association cortex but strongest in the default mode network (DMN), which is connected to the anterior hippocampus and thought to create our sense of self. Performing a perceptual task reduced psilocybin-induced network changes, suggesting a neurobiological basis for grounding, connecting with physical reality during psychedelic therapy. The acute brain effects of psilocybin are consistent with distortions of space-time and the self. Psilocybin induced persistent decrease in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and cortex (and DMN in particular), lasting for weeks but normalizing after 6 months. Persistent suppression of hippocampal-DMN connectivity represents a candidate neuroanatomical and mechanistic correlate for psilocybin’s pro-plasticity and anti-depressant effects. Psychedelic drugs can reliably induce powerful changes in the perception of self, time and space via agonism of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A receptor)1,2. In clinical trials, a single high dose of psilocybin has demonstrates immediate and sustained symptom relief in depression3–8, and addiction9. Taken together, these two observations suggest that psychedelics should have distinct neurobiological signatures corresponding to acute (intoxication) and persisting (after the drug has been eliminated from the body) phases. Acute effects of psilocybin include increase in glucose metabolism in frontal and medial temporal cortex10,11. EEG and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies of acute psychedelic effects have reported decreased signal power12,13 and functional connectivity (FC) with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), and LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) broadly across the cortex. These seemingly paradoxical observations of increased metabolism and decreased signal power are not understood. Persisting effects of psychedelics include increase in the expression of genes that contribute to synaptic plasticity14,15, and increase in growth of neurites and synapses in vitro16, and in vivo17–19. Network-level correlates of persisting psilocybin effects remain unknown in humans. Rodent models have suggested that the burst of plasticity in the medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus may be key to psilocybin’s antidepressant effects16,17,20. The medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus form core part of the default mode network21 and increased cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms22. Precision functional mapping (PFM) utilizes dense repeated rsfMRI sampling23–25 to reveal the timecourses of individual-specific intervention-driven brain connectivity changes26. The PFM approach takes advantage of the high variability in brain networks across individuals and high stability within individuals24. We applied the PFM approach to detail the individual-specific acute and persistent effects of a single high dose of psilocybin (25mg). Healthy young adults received psilocybin (PSIL) and methylphenidate (MTP, generic Ritalin, dose-matched for arousal effects) on different days and underwent regular MRI sessions (~18 per participant) each before, during, between, and after the two drug doses (Fig. S1A). Dense pre-drug sampling familiarized participants with the scanner and establish baseline variability. We found that psilocybin produced changes in brain network structure that far exceeded those induced by other state changes such as treatment with methylphenidate, or an auditory-visual task. Interrogation of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal revealed that the highly conserved spatial structure of resting BOLD fluctuations was dramatically altered by psilocybin. Finally, we identified a change in hippocampal-cortical connectivity that persisted for weeks after psilocybin and had normalized by the time participants returned for additional open label psilocybin doses 6+ months later. Psilocybin acutely caused profound and widespread brain network changes (Figs. 1a, S2, S3), greater than 3x larger than the effects of methylphenidate or other manipulations (task engagement = 1.30, methylphenidate = 1.51, high head motion = 1.46, psilocybin = 4.58, between person = 4.58). To put psilocybin’s effects in perspective, it helps to consider that the differences in an individuals’ brain organization on/off drug were as large as those between different persons (Fig. 1b). Brain-wide connectivity change (Euclidian distance) was calculated across the cortex and subcortical structures and effects of condition were determined with a linear mixed effects (LME) model. a) Top: psilocybin-associated network change (LME model, t-statistic). Middle: methylphenidate-associated network stimulant. Bottom: day to day FC variability (random effect of day). b) Whole Brain network change magnitude (Euclidian distance between brain-wide connectivity matrices) reveals that psilocybin produces much larger change than methylphenidate, closer in magnitude to between person differences. Vertical bars and asterisks indicate significance (p<0.05) for post-hoc t-test between conditions. c) Change by system (resting-state network), based on individualized Infomap parcellation. Open circles represent individual subjects, bars represent average magnitude. *Disruption was significantly enriched within the default mode network based on rotation permutation testing. d) Psilocybin Network Change across the bilateral hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (same color scale as panel a). In the cortex, psilocybin-associated changes localized to association networks. To assess resting state networks (RSNs, referred to here as ‘systems’) specificity, we ran a community detection algorithm on each participant and then compared network change between system, using a rotation-based null model27. Psilocybin-associated change was greatest in the default mode networks (Fig. 1c). By contrast, network changes associated with methylphenidate consistently localized to motor and action communities (Fig. S3). Individual-specific psilocybin-induced brain changes were consistent when participants returned 6 months later for a second psilocybin dose (correlation between change maps; r=0.67) (Fig. S2). In subcortex, the largest psilocybin-associated network changes were seen in DMN-connected parts of the thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and hippocampus (Fig. 1d)21,28,29. In the hippocampus, foci of strong FC disruption were in the anterior hippocampus (MNI: −24, −22,16 and 24, −18,16). In the basal ganglia, the largest FC disruptions were seen in mediodorsal (MD) thalamus and anteromedial caudate. In the cerebellum the largest FC disruptions were seen in the DMN29. To examine the latent dimensions of variability in brain networks across participant, drug condition, and task, we performed multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) on brain networks from every session24. Dimension 1 (Dim1), the dimension which explained the largest amount of variability across the dataset, largely separated psilocybin from other scans (Fig. 2a), apart from one session where the participant (P5R) vomited 30 minutes after taking the psilocybin dose and was not re-dosed (red dots on the left of Fig. 2a). The higher score on Dim1 associated with psilocybin, corresponded to reduced segregation between default mode, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and cingulo-opercular network – systems that are normally anticorrelated 30(Figs. 2c and S5). Subtraction of average FC during psilocybin minus baseline revealed a similar pattern of FC change (Fig. S5). To determine if this reflects a common effect of psilocybin that generalized across dataset and psychedelics, we calculated Dim1 scores for extant datasets from participants receiving I.V. psilocybin31 and LSD32. Psychedelic increased Dim1 in nearly every participant in the LSD and psilocybin datasets (Fig. 2d). In the scatter plots, each point represents the functional network from a single scan, plotted in a multidimensional space based on the similarity between scans. Replication scans are represented with open circles. a) Dimensions 1 and 4 are plotted for every 15-minute scan. In the top panel, points are colored based on drug condition. In the bottom panel, points are colored based on participant identity. Dimension 1 separates psilocybin from non-drug and MTP scans in most cases. Dimension 4 separates individuals in most cases and shows a small but significant before/after effect. C) Visualization of dimension 1 weights (top 1% of edges are projected onto the brain to show the connections most effected by psilocybin). D) In additional datasets with LSD (top) and psilocybin (bottom), psychedelic causes reliable change along dimension 1. By comparison, methylphenidate produced a decrease in connectivity between regions in the sensory, motor, and auditory networks (Fig. S5b), consistent with previous reports33 and similar to the effect of caffeine25. To verify that observations in our sample (N = 7) were generalizable, we compared our study’s stimulant effects to those in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study34 (n = 487 taking stimulants). The main effect of stimulant use on FC in ABCD was consistent with methylphenidate-associated FC changes in our dataset (Fig. S5b). To investigate how psilocybin-driven network changes are influenced by task states, participants were asked to complete a simple auditory-visual matching task in the scanner. Participants performed this task with high accuracy during drug sessions (Fig. S4). Engagement in the task significantly decreased the magnitude of psilocybin-associated network disruption by 43% (change (psilocybin + rest) = 4.58; change (psilocybin + task) = 2.59; unpaired t-test, P = 0.0041; Figs. 1b & S3c), suggesting that psilocybin’s acute effects on brain networks may be context dependent. The reduction of psilocybin-driven brain changes parallels the psychological principle of ‘grounding’ – directing one’s attention on sensory perception as a means of alleviating intense or distressing thoughts or emotions – which is commonly employed in psychedelic-associated psychotherapy35. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of context-dependent effects of psilocybin on functional connectivity and fills an important gap between preclinical studies of context dependence36,37 and clinical observations38. Evoked responses during the auditory-visual matching task were largely unchanged during psilocybin, suggesting that altered neurovascular uncoupling is unlikely to account for observed FC change (Fig. S4). We observed that the normally stable spatial structure of resting fMRI fluctuations was disrupted by psilocybin, making the FC desynchronized and disorganized (see video supplement). We measured synchrony of brain signals using Normalized Global Spatial Complexity (NGSC) – a measure of spatial entropy that is independent of the number of signals39. NGSC calculates cumulative variance explained by subsequent spatiotemporal patterns (Fig. 3a). The lowest value of NGSC=0 means that the timecourse for vertex/voxel is identical. The highest value of NGSC=1 means that the timecourse for every vertex/voxel is independent – indicating maximal desynchronization (or spatial entropy). a) normalized global spatial complexity (NGSC) captures the ‘complexity’ of brain activity patterns. It is derived from the number of spatial principal components (PCs) used to explain the data. Higher entropy = less desynchronized activity. b) Whole-brain entropy (NGSC) is shown for every fMRI scan for a single participant (P6). Psilocybin scans are shown in red. At right, increases during psilocybin were present in all participants (box and whiskers indicate quartiles and 99.7th percentiles for non-drug scans, red circles indicate psilocybin) c) Entropy within functional brain areas shown similar increases. d) Spatial entropy is visualized on the cortical surface. Psilocybin-associated increase in entropy was largest in association cortices. This was replicated in LSD data (middle; using data from Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) and corresponds spatially to 5ht2A binding density (bottom; borrowed with permission from Beliveau et al., 2017). Psilocybin significantly increased NGSC (mixed effects model with individual differences and head motion as random effects, p = 9.2e-7), with levels returning to pre-drug baseline by the following session (Fig. 3b- d). The increase in NGSC was observed at whole-brain and individual brain area levels (Fig. 3c, d), with the largest increases in association cortex and minimal chance in primary cortex (Fig. 3d). Global and local desynchronization replicated in an LSD dataset (Fig. 3d)32 and the distribution of these effects closely matched PET-based maps of 5HT-2A receptor density (Fig. 3e)40. To assess if persistent neurotrophic and psychological effects of psychedelics might be reflected in network changes weeks after psilocybin, we assessed network changes 1–21 days post-psilocybin (compared to pre-drug). Whole brain network change scores were small, and not significantly different from day-to-day variability, indicating that the brain’s structure had mostly returned to baseline (Fig. S2 and S3). The anterior hippocampus forms part of the default mode network21 and atypical cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms22. The same region of the anterior hippocampus which showed strong acute FC changes with psilocybin showed persistent connectivity alterations in the three weeks post-drug period (Fig. 4a and Supplemental figure 7). This persistent suppression of FC between the anterior hippocampus and cortex was found in all participants (Fig. 4b; LME model testing change in RMS AntHippo-cortical FC with head motion as a random effect: p = 5.1e-5). a) Group network change (relative to baseline) t-maps, left hippocampus: top=acute psilocybin, bottom = persisting (2 weeks after psilocybin. b) All subjects demonstrated a weakening of anterior hippocampal-cortical FC post-psilocybin (p=5.1e-5; linear mixed effects model accounting for head motion and subject ID). c) Connectivity from an anterior hippocampus seedmap at baseline, post-psilocybin and change for an exemplar (P3). The red border on the right-most brain illustrates individual-defined default mode network. A decrease in hippocampal FC with parietal and frontal components of the DMN is seen. d) Timecourse of anterior hippocampus - DMN for all participants/scans (participant colors as in panel b). A moving average is shown in black. e) schematic of hippocampal-cortical circuits, borrowed from Zheng et al., 2021. As predicted based on typical connectivity patterns, FC between the anterior hippocampus and DMN was decreased after psilocybin (Fig. 4c- e). Timecourse visualization, after aligning psilocybin doses between subjects, suggests that connectivity is reduced for 3 weeks after psilocybin but returned to pre-drug by 6–12-month replication scans (Fig. 4d). This observation is compelling, as it localized to the anterior hippocampus, a brain region shown to demonstrate substantial synaptogenesis following psilocybin18. Reduced hippocampal-cortical FC may reflect increased flexibility of self-oriented hippocampal circuits. The synchronized patterns of co-activation in the resting brain are believed to reflect the brain’s perpetual job of modeling reality41. It follows that the stability of synchronized brain networks across day, task, methylphenidate, and arousal levels (but not between individuals), reflects the subjective stability of waking consciousness. By contrast, the much larger changes induced by psilocybin fit with participants’ subjective report of a radical change in consciousness. The large magnitude of psilocybin’s effects, in comparison to methylphenidate, suggests that observed changes are not merely a consequence of changes in arousal or a nonspecific effect of monoaminergic stimulation42. Multi-unit recording studies suggest that agonism of 5HT2A receptors by psychedelics does not uniformly increase or decrease firing of pyramidal neurons, but rather serves to desynchronize pairs or populations of neurons which co-activate under normal conditions43. We observed a parallel phenomenon at the region, and whole brain level. This may explain the paradoxical effects of psychedelic seen in PET FDG and fMRI: disruption of synchronized activity should produce a decrease in power of local fluctuations12,13, despite an increase in metabolic activity, and a loss of the brain’s segregated network structure32,44. This desynchronization of neural activity has been described as an increase in entropy or randomness of brain activity in the psychedelic state45,46 (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), and it has been hypothesized to underly the cognitive and perception changes associated with psychedelics. The dramatic departure from normal synchronized patterns of co-activation may be key not only to understanding psilocybin’s acute effects, but also its persistent neurotrophic effects. Changes in resting BOLD activity are linked to shifts in glutamate-dependent signaling during psilocybin47,48. This phenomenon, shared by ketamine and psychedelics, engages homeostatic plasticity mechanisms49 - a neurobiological response to large deviations in typical network activity patterns50–52. This response to novelty includes rapid upregulation in expression of BDNF, mTOR, EF2 and other plasticity-related immediate early genes15,48. Consistent with this notion, psilocybin produced the largest changes in the fronto-parietal and default mode network, brain systems frequently associated with neuropsychiatric disorders53. Psychedelics rapidly induce plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex and this appears to be necessary for rapid antidepressant-like effects in animal models. However, to understand the underpinnings of psychedelics’ unique effects, it is necessary to study the human brain. Advances in precision functional mapping and individual-level characterization enabled us to identify desynchronization of resting state fMRI signals and localize these changes to depression-relevant circuits. Novel methods to measure neurotrophic markers in the human brain54 will provide a critical link between mechanistic observations at the cellular, brain-systems and psychological levels. Such links will help answer fundamental questions about the diagnosis and treatment of conditions of psychiatric illness. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and procedures established by the Washington University in Saint Louis Institutional Review Board. All participants were compensated for their time. All aspects of this study were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) Internal Review Board, the Washington University Human Research Protection Office (WU HRPO), the Federal Drug Administration (IND: 202002165) and the Missouri Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) under a federal DEA schedule 1 research license and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04501653). Psilocybin was supplied by Usona Institute via Almac Clinical Services. Healthy young adults (N=7, 18–45 years) were enrolled in a randomized cross-over precision functional brain mapping study to evaluate differences in individual-level connectomics pre-, during, and post- psilocybin exposure. Participants underwent imaging during drug sessions with psilocybin (PSIL) 25mg, or methylphenidate (MTP) 40mg as well as non-drug imaging sessions. Drug condition categories were 1) before psilocybin (‘Baseline’), 2) Drug 1( methylphenidate or psilocybin), 3) between, 4) Drug2 and 5) After. A minimum of 3 non-drug imaging sessions were completed during each non-drug window: before (baseline), between and after drug sessions. The number of non-drug MRI sessions was dependent on availability of the participant, scanner and scanner support staff. Dosing day imaging sessions were conducted 60–180 minutes following drug administration during peak blood concentration55. MTP was selected as the active control condition to simulate the cardiovascular effects and physiological arousal (i.e., controlling for dopaminergic effects) associated with psilocybin (Griffiths et al., 2006). Usona Institute, a United States non-profit medical research organization, provided good manufacturing practices (GMP) psilocybin. Drug sessions were facilitated by two clinical research staff who completed an approved in-person or online facilitator training program provided by Usona Institute, as part of Usona’s phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03866174). The role of the study facilitators was to build a therapeutic alliance with the participant throughout the study, prepare them for their drug dosing days, and to observe and maintain participant safety during dosing day visits35. The pair consisted of an experienced clinician (lead clinical facilitator) and a trainee (co-facilitator).  Participants were invited to return >6 months after completing the initial cross-over study for an open label psilocybin dose (which we refer to as ‘replication protocol). This included 1–2 baseline fMRIs, a psilocybin session (identical to initial session, except for blinding), and 1–2 “after” sessions within 4 days of the dose. Healthy adults ages 18 to 45 years were recruited via campus-wide advertisement and colleague referral. Participants were enrolled from March 2021 to May 2023. Participants were required to have had at least one previous lifetime psychedelic exposure (e.g., psilocybin, mescaline, ayahuasca, LSD), but no psychedelics exposure within the past 6 months. Individuals with psychiatric illness (depression, psychosis, addiction) based on DSM-5 were excluded. Participants were scanned roughly every other day over the course of the experiment (Fig. S1). Imaging was performed at a consistent time of day to minimize diurnal effects in functional connectivity 56. Neuroimaging was performed on a Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) in the neuroimaging labs (NIL) at the Washington University Medical Center. Structural scans (T1w and T2w) were acquired for each participant at 0.9 mm isotropic resolution, with real-time motion correction. Structural scans from different sessions were averaged together for the purposes of Freesurfer segmentation and nonlinear atlas registrations. To capture high resolution images of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, we used an echo-planar imaging sequence with 2mm isotropic voxels, multi-band 6, multi-echo 5 (TEs: 14.20 ms, 38.93 ms, 63.66 ms, 88.39 ms, 113.12 ms), TR 1761ms, flip angle = 68 degrees, and in-plane acceleration57 (IPAT/grappa) = 2. This sequence acquired 72 axial slices (144mm coverage). Each resting scan included 510 frames (lasting 15:49 minutes) as well as 3 frames at the end used to provide estimate electronic noise. Every session included two rest scans, totally 30-minute resting-state fMRI, during which participants were instructed to hold still and look at a white fixation crosshair presented on a black background. Head motion was tracked in real time using Framewise Integrated Real-time MRI Monitoring software (FIRMM)58. An eye-tracking camera (EyeLink, Ottawa) was used to monitor participants for drowsiness. Participants also completed a previously validated event-related fMRI task initially designed for the purposes of modeling hemodynamic responses in the auditory, visual, and motor cortices. Two task fMRI runs were completed during a subset of imaging sessions. Task fMRI runs employed the same sequence using in resting fMRI, included 48 trials (24 congruent, 24 incongruent), and lasted a total of 410s. See supplemental methods ‘Matching task’ fMRI for details. Resting fMRI data were preprocessed using a in-house processing pipeline. Briefly, this included alignment, normalization, non-linear registration, removal of thermal noise using NORDIC59, bandpass filtering, and scrubbing at a movement threshold of 0.3mm. Tissue-based regressors were computed in volume (white matter, ventricles, extra-axial CSF)60 and applied following projection to surface. Details on rsfMRI preprocessing are provided in supplemental methods.  Surface generation and processing of functional data followed procedures similar to Glasser and colleagues 201361. For cortical regions and resting state networks, we used a surface parcellation and community assignments generated by Gordon & Laumann and colleagues27. See supplemental methods for further details on surface generation and cortical parcellation. For subcortical regions, we used a set of regions of interest (Seitzman et al., 2020) generated to achieves full coverage and optimal region homogeneity. A subcortical limbic system was defined based on neuroanatomy: amygdala, antero-medial thalamus, nucleus accumbens, anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus62. These regions were expanded to cover fill anatomical structures (e.g. anterior hippocampus)63. To generate region-wise connectivity matrices, time courses of all surface vertices or subcortical voxels within a region were averaged. Functional connectivity (FC) was then computed between each region timeseries using Fisher z-transformed Pearson correlation.  We identified canonical large-scale networks using the individual-specific network matching approach described in previously27–29. Briefly, cortical surface and subcortical volume assignemtns was derived using the graph-theory-based Infomap algorithm64. In this approach, we calculated the Pearson correlation matrix from all cortical vertices and subcortical voxels, concatenated across all a participant’s scans. Correlations between vertices within 30 mm of each other were set to zero. The Infomap algorithm was applied to each subject’s correlation matrix thresholded at a range of edge densities spanning from 0.01% to 2%. At each threshold, the algorithm returned community identities for each vertex and voxel. Communities were labeled by matching them at each threshold to a set of independent group average networks described in Gordon et al. 2016. In each individual and in the average, a “consensus” network assignment was derived by collapsing assignments across thresholds, giving each node the assignment it had at the sparsest possible threshold at which it was successfully assigned to one of the known group networks. See supplementary figure S2 and S3 for individual and group mode assignments.  Network change (‘distance’) was calculated at the vertex level to generate network change maps (Fig. 1a- d, Fig. 4) and a linear mixed effects model with wild bootstrapping65,66 was used to generate statistics on these maps. First, a distance map was generated for every scan by computing, for each vertex, the average distance between its FC seedmap and the FC seedmap for each of that subject’s baseline scans. Second, distance maps for every scan were labeled on 5 dimensions: Subject ID, MRI session, task (task/rest), drug condition (baseline, PSIL, between, MTP, after, etc.), and head motion (average framewise displacement). Distance maps and associated conditions were then used to solve a linear mixed effects model in which drug condition and task were fixed effects, and Subject ID, MRI session, and head motion were random effects. Wild bootstrapping in combination with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was employed to estimate p-values for t-statistic maps resulting from the LME model. To perform the analysis, a wild bootstrapping procedure was implemented, which involved resampling clusters or groups of observations rather than individual data points. A large number of bootstrap samples (B=1,000) were generated using the Rademacher procedure66, where the residuals were randomly inverted to disrupt any potential autocorrelation. Specifically, a Rademacher vector was generated by randomly assigning −1 or 1 values with equal probability to each observation’s residual. By element-wise multiplication of the original residuals with the Rademacher vector, bootstrap samples were created to capture the variability in the data. For each bootstrap sample, the TFCE algorithm was applied to enhance the sensitivity to clusters of significant voxels or regions while controlling for multiple comparisons. The value of the enhanced cluster statistic, derived from the bootstrap samples, was used to create a null distribution under the null hypothesis. By comparing the original observed cluster statistic with the null distribution, p-values were derived to quantify the statistical significance of the observed effect. The p-values were obtained based on the proportion of bootstrap samples that produced a maximum cluster statistic exceeding the observed cluster statistic. Significance thresholds were determined using alpha = 0.05 to control for the family-wise error rate. The combined approach of wild bootstrapping with the Rademacher procedure and TFCE provided a robust and data-driven method to generate p-values for neuroimaging data. This methodology accounted for the complex correlation structure, effectively controlled for multiple comparisons, and accommodated potential autocorrelation in the residuals through the Rademacher procedure. By incorporating these techniques, significant effects of psilocybin and other conditions were reliably identified amidst noise and spatial dependencies.  For analyses in Figs. 1b, 2, S2, S3, distance calculations were computed at the parcel level. The effects of day-to-day, drug condition (baseline, psilocybin, between, MTP, after), task, and head motion and their interactions were directly examined by calculating the distance between each functional network matrix. RMS Euclidean distance was computed between the linearized upper triangles of the parcellated FC matrix between each pair of 15-minute fMRI scans, creating a second-order ‘‘distance” matrix (Fig. S2). In this analysis, the two task sessions were concatenated to match the length of the 15-minute rest runs. Subsequently, the average distance was examined for functional network matrices that were (1) from the same individual within a single session, (2) from the same individual across days (‘‘day-to-day”), (3) from the same subject between drug and baseline (e.g. ‘‘PSIL v Base”), (4) from the same individual but different tasks (‘‘task:rest”), (5) from the same individual between highest motion scans and baseline (“hi:lo motion”), (6) from different individuals (“between person”). Post-hoc comparison between drug conditions was conducted using two-tailed t tests. A related approach using z-transformed Pearson correlation (‘similarity’ rather than distance) was also taken and results were unchanged (Fig. S2c).  The different conditions above were compared by calculating whole brain network change magnitudes as shown in Figs. 1b, S2, and S3c. These are reported in the text as normalized network change scores calculated using the following procedure: We (i) determined network change for each condition compared to baseline as described above, (ii) subtracted within-session distance for all conditions (such that within-session network change = 0), (iii) divided all conditions by day-to-day distance (such that day-to-day network change = 1). Thus, normalized whole brain network change values (e.g. PSIL v Base = 4.58) could be thought of as proportional to day-to-day variability.  We used a classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach to cluster brain networks across fMRI sessions, as described by Gratton and colleagues24. This data driven approach was used to identify how different parameters (e.g. task, drug, individual) affect similarity/distance between networks. MDS places data in multidimensional space based on the similarity (Euclidean distance; correlation-based distances produce similar results) among data points – where in this case a data point represents the linearized upper triangle of a given functional network matrix. Each separate matrix (from a given subject, task, and session) was entered into the classical MDS algorithm (implemented using MATLAB 2019, cmdscale.m). Multiple dimensions of the data were explored. The eigenvectors were multiplied by the original FC matrices to generate a matrix of eigen-weights that corresponded to each dimension.  To assess network specificity of vertex-wise PSIL network change values, we calculated average network change of matched null networks consisting of randomly rotated networks with preserved size, shape, and relative position to each other. Following Gordon & Laumann et al., 2016, we employed a rotation-based null model, in which a subject’s subnetworks were iteratively rotated a random amount around the spherical expansion of the cortical surface. The spatial autocorrelation of smoothed BOLD data means that small networks are more likely to contain a single connectivity pattern than large networks. To create such matched random networks, we rotated each hemisphere of the original networks a random amount around the x, y, and z axes on the spherical expansion of the cortical surface. This procedure randomly relocated each network while maintaining networks’ size, shape, and relative positions to each other. Random rotation followed be computation of RSN-average PSIL network change score was repeated 1000 times to generate null distributions of network change scores. Vertices rotated into the medial wall were not included in the calculation. Actual PSIL network change score was then compared to null rotation permutations to generate a p-value for each of 12 systems (resting state networks) that were consistently present across every subject’s infomap parcellation. For bar graph visualization of ‘PSIL Change by System’ (Figs. 1, S3), RSNs with greater change (p<0.05 based on null rotation permutations) are shown their respective color (as indicated in Fig. S3) and all other RSNs are shown in gray. We used a n approach previously validated to assess spatial complexity (termed entropy) or neural signals39. Temporal principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the full BOLD dense timeseries, which yielded m principal components (m = ~80K surface vertices and subcortical voxels) and associated eigenvalues. The normalized eigenvalue of the i -th principal component was calculated as where m was the number of principal components, λ i and λ i represented the eigenvalue and the normalized eigenvalue of the i -th principal component respectively. Lastly, the NGSC, defined as the normalized entropy of normalized eigenvalues, was computed using the equation:  The NGSC computed above attains values from the interval 0 to 1. The lowest value NGSC=0 would mean the brain-wide BOLD signal consisted of exactly one principal component or spatial mode, and there is maximum global functional connectivity between all vertices. The highest value NGSC=1 would mean the total data variance is uniformly distributed across all m principal components, and a maximum spatial complexity or a lowest functional connectivity is found. To assess if persistent effects of psychedelics, we compared network changes 1–21 days post-psilocybin to pre-drug baseline. The network change analysis (described above) indicated that connectivity at the ‘whole brain’ level did not change following psilocybin (Fig. S2 and S3). A screen was conducted with p>0.05 threshold to identify brain systems or areas showing persisting effects. This analysis identified the anterior hippocampus as a candidate region of interest (ROI) for persisting FC change (see ‘Pre/Post Psilocybin Network Change Analysis’ in Extended Data). We assessed anterior hippocampus FC globally with cortex and specifically with the DMN. A bilateral anterior hippocampus ROI was used to generate a cortex-wide FC seed map for every session. Root-mean-square FC was computer to generate global FC67. Global FC was compared between pre-psilocybin sessions and post-psilocybin using a linear mixed effects model described above (drug condition and task were fixed effects, and Subject ID, MRI session, and head motion were random effects). Post-hoc visualization and timecourses were generated for FC with individual-defined default mode network. Raw fMRI and structural data from (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012) and (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) were run through our in-house registration and processing pipeline described above. These datasets were used for replication, external validation, and generalization to another classic psychedelic (i.e., LSD) for the measures described above (e.g., normalized global spatial complexity, and the MDS-derived psilocybin FC dimension (Dimension 1).

Evolutionary virologist Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks out ancient pathogens,"Evolutionary virologist Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks out ancient pathogens  Every print subscription comes with full digital access He has reconstructed two viruses brought to the Americas during European colonization Daniel Blanco-Melo’s obsession with viruses bloomed in high school. Today he studies how they’ve shaped human evolution and history. COURTESY OF D. BLANCO-MELO By Pratik Pawar NOVEMBER 14, 2023 AT 9:00 AM Smallpox, measles, mumps. These are among the contagious diseases that European colonists likely brought to the Americas at the turn of the 16th century, prompting the collapse of Indigenous populations. But the exact viruses that caused the millions of deaths remain unknown. Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks to solve that historical puzzle. An evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, he uses cutting-edge tools to study ancient viruses and illuminate how they have shaped human evolution and history. In recent work, Blanco-Melo and colleagues reconstructed two viruses circulating in Mexico at the time of European colonization. “Our research on ancient viruses is really appealing to the curiosity of the people and how we can study history,” Blanco-Melo says. But this work also holds personal meaning for Blanco-Melo as someone who was born and raised in Mexico. Through genetic sleuthing, he is able to study “something that is very dear in my heart,” he says, “really understanding, with molecular biology, those historical events.” Blanco-Melo’s obsession with viruses bloomed in high school when he had a chance encounter with Matt Ridley’s book Genome. Blanco-Melo had bought it as a Father’s Day gift for his dad but ended up reading it himself. Later, with encouragement from his biology teacher, he enrolled in an undergraduate program in genomics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, campus in Cuernavaca. He had his first encounter with ancient viruses as a Ph.D. student at the Rockefeller University in New York City. His research focused on particular viruses called endogenous retroviruses, remnants of past infectious viruses that have become integrated into a host’s genetic instruction book. Blanco-Melo first cataloged the genetic remains left behind by an ancient retrovirus called HERV-T that spread among our primate ancestors tens of millions of years ago. Further analysis revealed that a gene responsible for producing the virus’s outer envelope stuck around throughout primate history; even modern humans retain an inactive version. This gene encodes the envelope protein that helps the virus enter and infect a cell by interacting with another protein on the cell surface. Why would such a viral gene be so well preserved, Blanco-Melo wondered. What kind of evolutionary advantage could it have offered? Based on studies of cells in a lab dish, he hypothesizes that ancient primates must have co-opted the viral gene and used the related protein to get rid of the cell surface protein, essentially blocking the virus’s entry into cells. This example highlights how a virus’s own genetic material, over the course of evolution, can be used against it. “This project not only satisfied my curiosity, but we were able to push it into a full-blown story of how a virus evolved, emerged, but also how that virus ceased to exist,” Blanco-Melo says. Perhaps today’s researchers can exploit similar strategies to combat current retroviruses — “the big goal being HIV,” Blanco-Melo says. More recently, Blanco-Melo has teamed up with María Ávila-Arcos, an evolutionary geneticist at UNAM and an old friend, to study viral epidemics that largely wiped out Indigenous populations in the Americas. Blanco-Melo, Ávila-Arcos and a team of researchers extracted and isolated viral DNA from skeletal remains that they dated to somewhere between the 15th and 17th centuries. These remains come from mass graves at a colonial hospital and a chapel in what is now Mexico City. Archaeological and hospital autopsy records suggest that the remains in the graves belonged to Indigenous people and enslaved Africans who were victims of epidemics that occurred during the 1540s and 1570s. Based on those findings, the team reconstructed the genetic instruction books of two viruses not previously known to be circulating at that time — human parvovirus B19 and a human hepatitis B virus. The study, published in 2021 in the journal eLife, is perhaps the first to obtain ancient viral sequences from the Americas, says Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutch who wasn’t involved in this work. “Knowing about the ancient viruses that were infecting people hundreds of years ago is of great scientific and historical interest throughout the world, but especially of interest in the Americas,” Bloom says. The team found that the ancient viruses were similar to contemporary African strains. They “seem to have arrived in Mexico shortly after the European arrival,” Blanco-Melo says, “but they did not come from Europe. They came from Africa, basically through the transatlantic slave trade.” Through the collaboration, Blanco-Melo has been careful to avoid helicopter research, where outsiders come to a place, get the data and take credit for the resulting work. “These samples should stay in Mexico, should be analyzed by Mexican researchers … and all those results are, of course, going to be communicated back into the communities. That’s our goal,” he says. Though the two viruses the team identified aren’t likely to have caused massive epidemics, they could have exacerbated some of the symptoms of other diseases. Ongoing projects based on the same samples from Mexico are looking for other viruses and even peptides to get a fuller picture of the viruses from that time — and perhaps pin down big culprits. “There’s a lot more research that needs to be done in order to capture those other causative agents,” Blanco-Melo says.

A flower-shaped soft robot could make brain monitoring less invasive,"A flower-shaped soft robot could make brain monitoring less invasive  Every print subscription comes with full digital access The flexible sensor array would be deployed through a small hole in the skull A new type of brain sensor consists of flexible “petals” (pictured) that are inverted into a central hub before insertion through a small hole in the skull and then “bloom” outward to lie flat on the brain's surface. ALAIN HERZOG/ÉCOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FÉDÉRALE DE LAUSANNE By Bob Hirshon MAY 10, 2023 AT 2:00 PM A tiny, flexible machine might one day help neuroscientists eavesdrop on electrical activity in the brain, allowing them to pinpoint and potentially treat seizures. Inserted into the skull through a hole just 1 to 2 centimeters wide, the flower-shaped device unfurls a flexible array of sensors that contact the brain’s surface, allowing it to monitor electrical activity, researchers report May 10 in Science Robotics. A successful demonstration on a minipig suggests the device could be a less invasive way to place sensors directly on the brain, which currently can require removal of a large section of skull. The device is known as a soft robot: soft, because unlike traditional mechanical devices, it’s made of flexible materials, and robot, because its sensory apparatus moves, opening like a flower once implanted (SN: 3/3/21). “Of all the soft robotics that I’ve seen, it’s kind of the one that you say, ‘Wow, this is really going to change, potentially, the way we do things in neurosurgery,’” says Joseph Madsen, a neurosurgeon at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study. “The idea of a robot that kind of internally unfolds and goes over the brain is just very elegant.” The robotic device consists of a central hub surrounded by six flat, petal-shaped sensors made of a soft, flexible material. At first, the petals are inverted into the hub. “It’s a bit like a glove where … you flip it outside in,” says Stéphanie Lacour, a bioengineer at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Geneva. Once inside the skull, a flow of saline solution through the hub gently forces the petals open, where they then lay flat against the surface of the cerebral cortex. Sensors in each petal signal when they’re in place and then start monitoring the brain, sending information back to a monitor via electrical wires. Lacour and colleagues tested a prototype in the brain of a minipig, successfully deploying the roughly daisy-sized sensor array inside the skull and recording electrical activity. The technology could be sized up to cover a larger area for human use, Lacour says. Future versions could be bidirectional, she says, not only sensing brain activity but also stimulating it. That might allow the device to stop seizure activity before it begins, stimulate brain areas damaged by stroke or act as a brain-machine interface to allow people to control devices (SN: 2/11/21). The researchers have created a company to further develop the technology and conduct the additional testing that will be required to gain approval for use in human patients.

Cheesy pictures: gymnast’s parmesan photos take Olympics by storm,"Cheesy pictures: gymnast’s parmesan photos take Olympics by storm  Giorgia Villa won silver with Italy in the women’s team final. But her passion for parmesan has also gained attention T hree years ago Italian gymnast Giorgia Villa was cruelly denied her first shot at Olympic glory when she injured her ankle less than two weeks before getting on the plane for Tokyo. On Tuesday, the 21-year-old from Brescia helped Italy to their first medal in artistic gymnastics since 1928, teaming with Angela Andreoli, Alice D’Amato, Manila Esposito and Elisa Iorio to win a historic silver behind the United States. The Italian quintet have become overnight celebrities back home, where they have been dubbed le fate d’argento (the silver fairies). But Villa’s profile has managed to transcend gymnastics in the days since her landmark medal thanks to a viral tweet which unearthed her endorsement deal with parmesan cheese. The images speak for themselves. There’s Villa posing in her leotard next to a wheel of parmesan. There’s Villa seated proudly with three wheels of parmesan, performing an aerial cartwheel over a wheel of parmesan, doing the splits on four wheels of, yep, parmesan. There’s Villa giving a warm embrace to her “best friend” – you guessed it – a wheel of parmesan. More than 20 sponsored posts across Villa’s social media channels have featured her showing off wheels, blocks and bite-size packets of the hard cheese. Olympic silver medalist and Italian gymnast Giorgia Villa is sponsored by parmesan cheese and takes many of her photos while posing with large wheels of cheese pic.twitter.com/klx8PEuFPN Three months before the Tokyo Olympics, Villa signed a sponsorship deal with the Parmigiano Reggiano Consortium (PRC), the association which oversees production and unites all producers of the cheese. A press release hailed the partnership as “confirming how the combination of Parmigiano Reggiano and the world of sport is indissoluble in terms of authenticity, quality and energetic value, both in sporting activity and in correct nutrition”. She is not the first athlete to get in bed with Big Parma. According to the Italian marketing agency Impresa e Sport, Parmigiano Reggiano has also partnered with current world No 1 men’s tennis player Jannik Sinner, former NBA point guard Nico Mannion and Paralympic swimmer Giulia Ghiretti and the fencer Matteo Neri. The association boasts that Parmesan cheese, which is made through a manufacturing process dating to the 13th century, is “suitable for a sports diet”. Some health experts agree, describing it as “easy digested, for the presence of ready to use proteins and lipids, lactose free, rich in calcium, with possible prebiotic and probiotic effect”. Villa’s mother signed her up for gymnastics lessons “before I destroyed her whole house” due to her high energy and activity level. “I had just started nursery school, but I immediately understood that I would love that sport with all my being,” she said. “I left school and, still wearing my pink apron, I couldn’t wait to enter that gym and jump and run feeling free and happy.” Since the age of 11 she has been schooled at the Italian Gymnastics Federation’s International Academy of Brescia, training six days a week. Villa no doubt caught the eye of the PRC’s power brokers after the 2019 world championships where she competed on all four apparatus to lead Italy to a surprise bronze, the country’s first team medal since 1950. No longer able to compete in the all-around due to a recurring back injury, Villa’s clean uneven bars routine on Tuesday played no small part in Italy’s historic medal. But it’s Villa’s magnetic enthusiasm that has enamoured the throngs of media who have packed the Bercy Arena over the past week. She could hardly contain her excitement after Sunday’s qualifying round, where she performed before a celebrity-flecked crowd that included Tom Cruise, Lady Gaga, Jessica Chastain, Ariana Grande and Anna Wintour. “Biles and her teammates are fabulous gymnasts, what can I say?” Villa said. “Simone is from another planet.

Djokovic has won his first Olympic gold medal by beating Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in the 2024 Games men’s tennis singles final. (AP Photo/Louise Delmotte)                    PARIS (AP) — For all of his Grand Slam championships and other titles, for all of his time at No. 1, Novak Djokovic really, really wanted an Olympic gold medal for Serbia, the last significant accomplishment missing from his glittering resume. He finally got one at age 37 on Sunday, beating Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in an enthralling and evenly matched men’s tennis singles final at the 2024 Games. In a sense, it doesn’t matter one bit how long it took, of course. Djokovic is now an Olympic champion and forever will be. And in another sense, the years of waiting, the stumbles along the journey, made him appreciate this triumph as much as — no, make that more than — every other, which is why his hands trembled when he knelt on Court Philippe Chatrier’s red clay at the end and why his tears flowed. “When I take everything into consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I ever had in my career,” said Djokovic, who didn’t drop a set in Paris and is the oldest man to win the Summer Games tennis title since 1908. “This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.” With margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tiebreakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago. “In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreaks, he played an impressive game,” said silver medalist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old from Spain who sobbed, too, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medalist. “That’s why I saw that he’s hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.”  Djokovic already owns a men’s-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze — and he made it clear that simply wasn’t sufficient. He kept talking over the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him — and Alcaraz said Sunday he kept hearing about it. 2024 Paris Olympics: Until getting Paris bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in Olympic semifinals, losing to the gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago. This time, Djokovic said, “I was ready.” In Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets. The 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic — and the “highest mountain to climb at the moment,” in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it. There was superb ball-striking, deft drop shots and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense. The No. 1 seed Djokovic saved eight break points, No. 2 Alcaraz saved six. Pressure? Ha. What pressure? “We both played at a very high level,” Djokovic said. “We really went toe-to-toe.” The only shame, perhaps, for the fans — and, naturally, Alcaraz — was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Those in the stands became part of the show, breaking out into choruses of “No-le! No-le!” or “Car-los! Car-los!” that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. As Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters chanted “Si, se puede!” (essentially, “Yes, you can!”). Yet the place was as quiet as a theater between points; play was delayed briefly when a young child’s crying pierced the air that was thick with anticipation. The first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes on the way to that tiebreaker, when Djokovic grabbed the last four points, then turned to face his guest box — which included his tennis team and his wife and their two children — with a fist held high. In the second tiebreaker, after Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point for a 3-2 lead, he waved his arms to encourage the folks standing and screaming. Soon, thanks to one last forehand winner, he had earned that prize he wanted, at long last. When the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out, Djokovic reached for his gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss. Was he worried that moment would never arrive? “There are always doubts. Absolutely, I had doubts,” Djokovic said. “But the belief and the conviction that I can make it is stronger than my doubts. It always has been. I knew that it’s going to happen. It was just a matter of when it’s going to happen.” AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games  Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.","1.

RB Leipzig confirm Xavi Simons stay at club in another loan,"RB LEIPZIG EXTEND LOAN DEAL FOR XAVI!     RBL agree another season-long loan for the Paris Saint-Germain attacker   Xavi to wear the number 10 shirt   25 goals contributions in 2023/24 Ready for a second year! Speculation surrounding Xavi’s future can finally be put to rest, with the Netherlands international (20 senior caps) returning to the Red Bulls for the new season. RB Leipzig will loan the 21-year-old from French giants Paris Saint-Germain for another year. With 10 goals in 43 games across all competitions (15 assists), Xavi had a scintillating first season at Cottaweg. Following Benjamin Šeško’s contract extension until 2029 a few weeks ago, RB Leipzig have been able to secure another key attacking player’s future at the club. Xavi also shone during the European Championship in Germany. He was a regular feature of the Dutch side, registering one goal and three assists to finish as the tournament’s third-best goal contributor and second-best assist provider. There will be a change of shirt number for Xavi in the new season. He will wear the number 10 and his shirt is available now in all Leipzig fan stores and online at the Red Bull Shop. Xavi will complete his medical on Monday at Cottaweg and then train individually for the first time since returning. The attacker will be available for questions at a press conference on Tuesday and will then train with the team for the first time. Welkom terug, Xavi!     After coming through the legendary youth academy ‘La Masia’ (FC Barcelona), Xavi moved to the U19s of Paris Saint-Germain in summer 2019. The talented youngster developed into a fantastic player and made his first-team debut for PSG in February 2021 in the Coupe de France. His first appearance in Ligue 1 followed around two months later. Xavi spent the 2022/23 season back in the Netherlands at PSV Eindhoven. His debut campaign in the Eredivisie was extremely impressive, as he finished the season as the division’s top goalscorer (19 goals) and recorded nine assists too. Overall in all competitions, Xavi was directly involved in 34 goals and was part of the PSV team that won the KNVB Beker. RB Leipzig agreed to sign Xavi on loan from Paris Saint-Germain in summer 2023 and so his journey here started. In his first competitive game for Marco Rose’s side, RBL won the DFL-Supercup with a 3-0 win away to FC Bayern. The young Dutchman mainly featured as an attacking midfielder last season. With eight goals and 13 assists in 32 Bundesliga games, Xavi played a big part in the club securing Champions League football for the sixth successive season. Our new number 10 added a further two goals and two assists in the Champions League last term.

"South Africa are looking to give Tristan Stubbs an extended run at No. 3 in their Test batting line-up, starting with this week's first Test against the West Indies in Port of Spain, coach Shukri Conrad said on Tuesday.","Coach Conrad backs big hitting Stubbs at number three in test side Final call! Get unlimited access to ST for $0.99/month  South Africa are looking to give Tristan Stubbs an extended run at No. 3 in their test batting line-up, starting with this week’s first test against the West Indies in Port of Spain, coach Shukri Conrad said on Tuesday. Stubbs, who turns 24 next week, has forged a reputation for his swashbuckling and powerful batting in the Twenty20 format but is now set for a role of some responsibility in the test side. He has played only one test previously, against India in January where he scored four runs in his two innings and saw South Africa lose by seven wickets. South Africa have struggled to find a consistent No. 3 in their batting line-up in recent years. “Tristan’s going to be given a good run in that position,” Conrad said. “I think his psyche and technique speaks to someone who will do that job really well. And I'm going to give him a good run. I'd be surprised if we didn't back him throughout the rest of the (test) cycle,” he told a virtual press conference. “I'm very confident that he’s going to come good, whether it's in the first test match, or the second, but I think we've got a good one for the future in the South African set up.” Conrad said Stubbs’ technique was the major factor in giving him the job, but also his imposing size. “Because you're going to be facing the new ball the bulk of the time, I know Tristan ticks all of those boxes. He's also quite an imposing character, a big strong boy, strapping boy. And I quite like that. I like the fact that at the top of the order we will imposing guys who have got a good aura about them with strong body language. “But ultimately, the proof is going be in the tasting. But yeah, I'm going down this road, and I'm confident we begin to reap the rewards.” South Africa play a first test series since sending a second-string side to New Zealand in February and suffering two heavy defeats. They take on a Windies team who last month lost a three-test series in England. “They've got three tough test matches under the belt and they'll come into this series at home taking a lot of confidence from several good performances,” Conrad said of the opposition.

Extra Kissed by Francis Ford Coppola in ‘Megalopolis’ Set Video Breaks Silence: ‘I Was in Shock’,"Video of Francis Ford Coppola Kissing Extra on ‘Megalopolis’ Set Revealed Matt Wilstein Matt Wilstein   The footage shows the acclaimed director walking into the middle of a nightclub scene in his new epic “Megalopolis” and kissing an unsuspecting background actor. Senior Editor “Sorry, if I come up to you and kiss you,” director Francis Ford Coppola boomed into a microphone on the set of his new film Megalopolis, according to an unnamed source who was there. “Just know it’s solely for my pleasure.” On Friday, Variety published two exclusive video clips leaked from the set of that much-maligned epic that show the 85-year-old filmmaker walking up to a scantily clad background actor and kissing her on the mouth. The Guardian previously reported witnesses who saw Coppola act in this inappropriate way during the film’s nightclub scene and quoted him as saying he was “trying to get them in the mood.” “I’ve worked with really important directors and that behavior is uncommon—the most I’ve ever seen any director do is say something like, ‘high energy, guys,’” the on-set source told Variety. “I’ve never seen anyone on set, and this extends to a camera operator, so much as touch an actor.” Of course, nothing about the Megalopolis production—or final result, for that matter—has been common. Coppola self-financed the film with $120 million project and then struggled to get a U.S. distributor for it after a string of highly divisive, mostly negative reviews out of Cannes. Lionsgate ultimately stepped in to release the film, which stars Adam Driver, Dustin Hoffman, and Shia LaBeouf among others, later this fall. “There were very contradicting views expressed, but the audience never stopped going to see the film, and to this day Apocalypse Now is still in very profitable distribution,” Coppola told The Daily Beast of the film’s controversial reception this past April. “I am sure this will be the same situation with Megalopolis. It will stand the test of time.” As for his on-set behavior, Coppola denied doing anything inappropriate in an interview with The New York Times last month, insisting, “I’m not touchy-feely. I’m too shy.” The leaked video footage tells a very different story. APOCALYPSE WOW   Senior Editor Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here.

In an interview with Bollywood Bubble, Rajeev expressed his opinion that it is unjust for politicians to advocate a ban on Pakistani actors. (Also read: Rajeev Khandelwal says Sanjay Leela Bhansali made him wait for a film for 1 year) Rajeev, while speaking about ther ban on Pakistani artists, opined, “Nahi nahi, it is politics. Bohot galat hai. Logo ko ban karne waale kaun hote hain politicians. Humari politics dictate karti hai kuchh cheezo ko. Jaha pe pyaar badh sakta hai, uss pyaar ko bhi aap badhne nahi de rahe, for whatever reasons. So, I don't understand this. Mera comment karna bhi galat hoga kyuki mujhe samajh hi nahi aata hai ki kyu. Hum aman ki baat karte hain na.

Pata nahi. I have seen a lot of love coming (No, it is all politics. This is very wrong. Who are these politicians to ban artists? Our politics dictates a certain narrative.

On Saturday, Kangana shared a morphed picture of Rahul Gandhi on her IG stories that showed him in a skull cap, with turmeric tika on his forehead and a cross necklace. She was taking a jibe at him for his recent remarks on caste census in the Parliament. Hours later, she was trending on Twitter for the ‘trolling’. (Also read: Kangana Ranaut calls Rahul Gandhi ‘pasta with kadi patta tadka’ amid his caste row with Anurag Thakur) With the picture, Kangana wrote, “Jaati jivi jise bina jaati pooche jaati ganana karani hai (He who wishes to hold a caste census without asking anyone's caste).” 'Kangana' is currently trending on Twitter with upwards of 20,000 tweets. Many have called her a ‘troll’ who is unfit for the Parliament. “This is an appeal to @siddaramaiah, @revanth_anumula and @mkstalin.

He later stated, “I had said that someone who doesn't know about caste talks about census. I did not name anyone.” Rahul, who had promised a nationwide census if INDIA bloc came into power, replied, “You can insult me as much as you like but we will pass the caste census in Parliament.

Ranvir Shorey and Sana Makbul had the most talked about rivalry in Bigg Boss OTT 3. The former housemates are in no mood to burry the hatchet and have gone on-record to speak against each other even after the reality show's finale. Ranvir, in a recent interview with Siddharth Kannan for his YouTube channel, responded to Sana's ‘male chauvinist’ comment and said being a girl doesn't give her the license to be unapologetic.

When she told me something, I gave it back, so now she shouldn’t be crying over me disrespecting her.” He further said, “Initially, we got along very well, I used to lovingly call her Pookie. I felt terrible about commenting on her lips, but I didn’t know the dog incident. It started on a good note, but later when our fights began she would twist the topic and that caught on.” Sana, in an interview with The Indian Express had stated that, “Strong women are not appreciated and he is one of those male chauvinist kind of a person who doesn’t like it if women do better than him. I don’t want to say anything about him. I have buried it all. I don’t hold any grudge against him. But if he does that, it is his way of dealing with things.

"Imane Khelif is a born woman, not a man: Chinmayi Sripaada defends boxer","By Yaseen Rashed This article was updated on August 6 in part to clarify details about Khelif’s boxing matches, past disqualification from the Women’s World Championships, and gender identity. Algerian Olympic boxer Imane Khelif made international headlines on August 1, when she knocked out Italian boxer Angela Carini just forty-six seconds into their match. After two forceful strikes to the head, Carini quit and fell to her knees in tears before walking away, refusing to shake Khelif’s hand. At one point, Carini could be heard on camera telling her coach, “It’s not right, it’s not right,” before exclaiming to the media that she had never been hit this hard in her career. Shortly after this, the hashtag #IStandWithAngelaCarini started to trend on social media. Prominent public figures, like former US President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, accused Khelif of being a transgender athlete and promised to keep “men out of women’s sports.” Others have called on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban her from competing in future matches, noting that she was disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) from the Women’s World Championships in New Delhi last year. The IBA said recently the disqualification was for failing to meet eligibility criteria. Some have erroneously claimed that the disqualification was because Khelif was biologically a male, despite the fact that Khelif was born female. The IBA stated that, ahead of the world championships in 2023, Khelif underwent a test (the nature of which is confidential, but the IBA stated it was not a testosterone examination). The IBA president later told Russian news agency Tass that her disqualification was because “it was proven they have XY chromosomes.” (There is no evidence that Khelif has XY chromosomes.) IOC spokesman Mark Adams told reporters that the committee could not confirm the IBA test results and that “this is not a transgender issue.” (The two organizations no longer work together.) Although Carini has since apologized for not shaking her opponent’s hand and said she felt badly that an online debate had transpired as a result, it wasn’t enough to stop the personal attacks on Khelif’s gender identity. Several media outlets have speculated that Khelif could have differences in sex development (DSD), a group of rare medical conditions, but there is no verification that she has DSD or any medical condition related to sex traits. Khelif is not transgender and does not identify as intersex, contrary to what many have claimed about her on social media. In the face of criticism after her disqualification last year, Khelif responded, “To say that I have qualities and abilities that do not qualify me to compete with women is illogical. I did not create myself. This is God’s creation.”   Middle East and North African (MENA) social media users were quick to stand behind Khelif, using the English and Arabic hashtags #IstandWithImaneKhelif and #إيمان_خليف (#Iman_Khelif) and calling her “brave” for standing her ground. The themes of discourse found online, mainly in Arabic, highlighted colonial-linked narratives about the “West” attempting to steal this win from an Arab athlete by fabricating lies about her gender identity. This also comes at a time when transgender rights in the West remain a highly contentious topic, especially in the lead-up to the US presidential election in November.  Some Algerian fans, in particular, have described the West’s reaction to Khelif’s win as “anti-Arab,” maintaining that Western notions of Arab womanhood remain entrenched in a profoundly Eurocentric and racist understanding. On X, Algerian cartoonist Nime posted a drawing of Khelif with her boxing shorts pulled down to reveal her pink undergarments to affirm her identity. Meanwhile, Algeria’s official football X account posted a picture of Carini at the press conference with the caption “cry more,” which has now gone viral with 59 million engagements. Many Algerians have highlighted the hypocritical nature of the accusations, noting that other Olympic female athletes, like US rugby player Ilona Maher, have been praised for taking a stand against body negativity and supporting women of “all the different body types,” while Khelif was harassed online for hers. Maher told her fans stories about how she was shamed for her masculine body type in a now-viral TikTok post with the caption, “All body types can be Olympians.” Yet, that same understanding was not extended to Khelif. Unfortunately, as the Associated Press noted, “Female athletes of color have historically faced disproportionate scrutiny and discrimination when it comes to sex testing and false accusations that they are male or transgender.”  Shortly after Khelif defeated Carini, far-right Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni posted a picture with Carini on X, stating, “I know you won’t give up, Angela, and I know that one day you will earn with effort and sweat what you deserve in a finally fair competition.” Other conservative public figures, like X’s Elon Musk, reposted videos of Khelif’s match and commentary warning US voters that “Kamala Harris supports this” in a bid to link the incident to domestic right-wing narratives about sexual identity amid a critical election cycle. Author J. K. Rowling, who has made transphobic comments in the past, also posted a picture of the match on X with the caption, “Could any picture sum up our new men’s rights movement better? The smirk of a male who’s knows he’s protected by a misogynist sporting establishment.” This strain of Western discourse portrays a bigoted understanding of womanhood, one rooted in anti-LGBTQI sentiments.  The contrast between both sides of the discourse highlights gaps in the social understanding of womanhood and sexuality. By denying Khelif’s womanhood and leveraging her win to disseminate miseducated narratives that fuel anti-LGBTQI sentiments, critics are essentializing the definition of gender and perpetuating stigmas.  This dangerous narrative, coupled with a rise in anti-Arab sentiments amid the ten-month Gaza war, has brewed the perfect storm for right-wing figures to launch baseless attacks on Khelif’s gender identity. Analyzing the sentiments behind these narratives can paint a picture of how divisive gender and sexuality discourse can be, especially amid a global election cycle. With the backdrop of race and nationality, these sentiments can be used to sustain a limited understanding of gender and LGBTQI identities. There is no “one box fits all” definition of these themes. Instead, using a nuanced approach to these complex issues could help shed light on the many unique experiences of womanhood. Like all Olympians, Khelif has dreamed of this moment since she was a young girl, growing up in an impoverished neighborhood where she and her family used to sell bread and plastic to afford her boxing lessons. Having beat Carini, Khelif won the quarterfinals against Hungarian boxer Anna Luca Hamori and is set to advance to the semifinals on August 6. With thirty-seven victories and nine defeats in her career, Khelif has earned her spot at the Olympics. Barring Khelif’s participation would only let misguided ideologies concerning gender identity win.

"In the seven days after President Biden stepped down as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Harris campaign raked in $200 million.","Harris Campaign Says It Raised $310 Million in July, More Than Double Trump’s Haul   ADVERTISEMENT In the seven days after President Biden stepped down as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Harris campaign raked in $200 million. By Theodore Schleifer Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign survived a brutal few weeks of fund-raising in July to bounce back so dramatically before the end of the month that she more than doubled the amount of money raised by former President Donald J. Trump, her campaign announced on Friday. The Harris campaign, which for the first 20 days of July was the Biden campaign, said it had raised $310 million during the month, including $200 million in just seven days after President Biden dropped out of the race. The Trump campaign and its own allies said on Thursday that they had collected $139 million in July, an enormous sum but well short of what the Harris campaign said it had brought in amid a huge burst of enthusiasm about her candidacy. The Harris campaign raised almost as much in July as the Biden campaign had raised in March, April, May and June combined. The surge in fund-raising has allowed Democrats, for the first time in months, to have a cash-on-hand advantage over Republicans. The Harris campaign said it now had $377 million in its war chest, in contrast to the $327 million that the Trump campaign has said it has. ADVERTISEMENT Neither campaign disclosed precisely how much of the money was raised or held by the campaigns themselves versus their allied party committees. Democrats’ fund-raising was said to have plummeted in the first three weeks of the month, in the aftermath of Mr. Biden’s disastrous debate, although precise figures were not known or released by the Biden campaign. But after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, the fund-raising spigot was opened wide. The $200 million that the Harris campaign said it had raised in the week after Mr. Biden ended his re-election bid was more than Mr. Biden’s haul in the first three months of the year. The Trump campaign’s own fund-raising was strong — and most likely would have far outstripped the Democrats’ had the party not changed its standard-bearer. The $139 million raised in July amounted to one of the Trump team’s strongest fund-raising months to date, just off the sum raised in May, when Mr. Trump’s supporters responded to his felony conviction with $141 million in donations. After collecting $112 million in June, donations for the Trump team ticked up in July as Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt, was formally nominated at the Republican convention in Milwaukee and picked Senator JD Vance of Ohio to be his running mate — events that surely motivated his donors and supporters. July was the second straight month in which Democrats out-raised the Trump team. In June, when Mr. Biden was still atop the ticket, his campaign raised $127 million and ended the month with $240 million on hand, all before the history-making events that would unfold over the next four weeks.

"The daughter of the judge in Donald J. Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial has worked as a consultant for Democratic candidates, though her relationship to the vice president is unclear.","Trump Claims Judge Has Ties to Harris and Seeks to Toss Him Off Case   ADVERTISEMENT  The daughter of the judge in Donald J. Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial has worked as a consultant for Democratic candidates, though her relationship to the vice president is unclear. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Ben Protess and Jay Root Former President Donald J. Trump is urging the judge who oversaw his Manhattan criminal trial to step aside, claiming in a legal filing that the judge has indirect ties to Vice President Kamala Harris and therefore an “actual conflict and appearances of impropriety.” In a letter to the judge released on Thursday — two months after Mr. Trump was convicted of falsifying documents to hide a sex scandal — Mr. Trump’s lawyers said that the judge’s daughter “has a longstanding relationship with Harris,” who is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and Mr. Trump’s election opponent. Mr. Trump’s legal team cited the daughter’s “work for political campaigns” as a Democratic consultant, an argument that many ethics experts had previously rejected. The letter is the former president’s latest long-shot bid to oust the judge, Juan M. Merchan, from the case. The judge, a former Republican now known as a moderate Democrat, refused Mr. Trump’s request last year to step aside. He cited a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter’s interests. Before the trial, Mr. Trump also tried unsuccessfully to remove the judge, who declared on the first day of jury selection in April, “There is no agenda here” and “We want justice to be done.” ADVERTISEMENT The new effort comes at a crucial moment, after Mr. Trump’s conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and before his sentencing next month. Mr. Trump has asked Justice Merchan to throw out the verdict in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling granting him broad immunity for official actions he took while in the White House. The Manhattan district attorney’s office, which brought the case, has argued that the Supreme Court decision had “no bearing on this prosecution” and urged the judge to uphold the jury’s verdict. Justice Merchan has promised to rule on Sept. 6. If he rejects Mr. Trump’s bid to toss out the conviction, he is set to impose the former president’s sentence on Sept. 18. Mr. Trump faces up to four years in prison, though the judge could decide on a much shorter jail term, or sentence him only to probation. Mr. Trump has sparred with the judge for months. In the lead-up to the trial, Mr. Trump berated Justice Merchan and his daughter, Loren Merchan, citing her work for Democratic candidates. But at the request of the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan imposed a gag order preventing Mr. Trump from assailing family members of prosecutors and the judge — in addition to prohibiting criticism of witnesses and jurors. Mr. Trump violated the order 10 times during the trial, resulting in $10,000 in fines. ADVERTISEMENT After the trial, Justice Merchan allowed attacks on witnesses and jurors, though he extended until Mr. Trump’s sentencing a narrow version of the gag order that covers prosecutors and their family members as well as family members of the judge. On Thursday, a New York appeals court rejected Mr. Trump’s effort to unwind those restrictions. The presidential election is 62 days away. Here’s our guide to the run-up to Election Day.

He has also sought to parry Ms. Harris’s attacks on him over the conviction by calling the judge biased, underscoring the importance to him of removing the gag order. “The court’s unjust and unconstitutional gag order continues to restrict President Trump’s ability to respond to Harris and address these topics with the American people,” his lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, wrote in the letter to the judge that was made public on Thursday. “Decisions by Your Honor on the pending Presidential immunity motion and at any sentencing would benefit not only Harris but also the professional aspirations and financial status of Your Honor’s daughter.” It is unclear how closely tied Ms. Merchan was to Ms. Harris. Cached pages from the website of Authentic Campaigns, a Democratic fund-raising and marketing firm, listed Loren Merchan in January 2024 as president. Her biography on the website noted that she had managed media campaigns for Ms. Harris, Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Beto O’Rourke. Mike Nellis, the chief executive of Authentic, declined to comment. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Trump was convicted in late May when a jury of 12 New Yorkers found he had falsified records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, in the final days of the 2016 campaign. Mr. Trump’s then-fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual liaison with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump repaid Mr. Cohen soon after ascending to the presidency, and approved plans to lie on company paperwork to hide the nature of the reimbursement, the jury found. In a recent filing, Mr. Bragg’s office cited “the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty.” William K. Rashbaum and Jonah E.

"With Prisoner Swap, Biden Scores a Win as His Term Nears Its End.The exchange offered a measure of validation for President Biden soon after he abandoned his bid for re-election.","With Prisoner Swap, Biden Scores a Win as His Term Nears Its End  ADVERTISEMENT  WHITE HOUSE MEMO The exchange offered a measure of validation for President Biden soon after he abandoned his bid for re-election. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Peter Baker Peter Baker covers the White House and previously spent four years reporting from Moscow. Even in the world of presidential multitasking, July 21 turns out to have been an extraordinary, whipsaw Sunday for President Biden. At 12:09 p.m., he picked up the phone at his vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., to talk with the prime minister of Slovenia as part of a high-stakes diplomatic gamble to seal a complicated, multinational prisoner swap. Just 97 minutes later, he posted a world-stunning letter online abandoning his bid for re-election after a bruising pressure campaign by his own Democratic allies, climaxing the biggest crisis of his political career and signaling the end of his presidency after a half-century in public life. By any measure, it was one of the darkest moments of his time in elective office as the inescapable reality of time, age and polls finally caught up with him. And yet it would lead to one of the most joyous days of his presidency barely a week and a half later as he orchestrated the release of imprisoned Americans from the dungeons of Russia. ADVERTISEMENT For Mr. Biden and his team, the successful negotiation to free 16 people held by Russia on Thursday, including three American citizens and a U.S. permanent resident, offered sweet validation even as the clock is now ticking toward his final curtain call in office. When the president appeared with relatives of the liberated prisoners in the State Dining Room of the White House, it was clearly personal to him and he framed it as a mission on behalf of the larger American family. “My dad had a simple proposition: Family is the beginning, the middle and the end. Blood of my blood and bone of my bone,” Mr. Biden said before hugging the daughter of one of the freed prisoners. “I could think of nothing more consequential.” As he often does, he drew on his own experience of personal tragedy. “Having lost family,” albeit in a very different way, he said that bringing home these tortured souls now, well, “it matters, it matters.” It clearly mattered to him too. Although he made no mention of the incredible timing of his diplomatic triumph, just an hour and a half before his political surrender, it reinforced a commitment to making his last five months in power count. He may be a lame duck now, but he has no intention of heading off quietly into the night — except his trip late Thursday to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, where he welcomed home the Americans. Mr. Biden’s staff made a point of talking up his diplomatic deftness in brokering the deal, bringing together seven countries in the largest such swap since the Cold War. And they emphasized that he and his administration had helped free more than 70 Americans wrongfully detained abroad during his tenure. ADVERTISEMENT “This was vintage Joe Biden,” said Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. “If you had not had Joe Biden sitting in the Oval Office, I don’t think this would have happened.” Mr. Sullivan, who has been personally invested in bringing home the hostages for years and had to deliver bad news to their families on many occasions, grew teary-eyed himself in the White House briefing room. “Today was a very good day,” he said, choking up. It was Mr. Sullivan who set up the president’s critical call with Prime Minister Robert Golob of Slovenia on July 21, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share behind-the-scenes details. The day before, on Saturday, July 20, Mr. Sullivan had been in Colorado for a meeting of the Aspen Strategy Group and worked the phones to bring together the deal. He was talking with his counterpart from Slovenia, which had agreed in principle to release two Russians held by that Balkan country as part of the swap to free the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and the others held by Moscow.

But the two Russians would have to be pardoned, and the Slovenians said they could not do that in time, according to the U.S. official. So Mr. Sullivan asked if he could arrange a call from the president to the prime minister. After flying back to Washington, Mr. Sullivan called from his home that Sunday and connected the two leaders through the White House Situation Room, according to the U.S. official. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Biden was in isolation in Rehoboth recovering from Covid — and unknown to nearly the whole world, finalizing his letter withdrawing from the race. Even Mr. Sullivan, one of Mr. Biden’s closest advisers, had no idea what the president was about to do when he patched through the call and only learned later — and not from the president. During the phone call, which lasted just a few minutes, Mr. Biden implored Mr. Golob to facilitate the release of the two Russians in his custody. In making his pitch, Mr. Biden even offered to visit Slovenia, the U.S. official said. What Mr. Biden did not say was that he would only have a few months left in office to follow up on that idea. Mr. Sullivan, asked about the timing of the call shortly before the withdrawal, said it was simply happenstance. “That’s when the pieces were falling in place,” he said. It was hardly the only conversation Mr. Biden had during the months of haggling. He reached out personally to other foreign leaders, most critically Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, who for a long time had resisted releasing Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin convicted of murdering a Chechen separatist in Germany on state orders. ADVERTISEMENT But with Mr. Biden pressing him, and the prospect of winning the release of Aleksei Navalny, the most prominent Russian opposition leader who was in prison, Mr. Scholz finally relented. “For you, I will do this,” he told Mr. Biden in January, according to U.S. officials. Mr. Navalny died in prison a few weeks later, temporarily sabotaging the deal. But Mr. Scholz still went along with releasing Mr. Krasikov in the end and got five German nationals imprisoned in Russia in trade. “The deal that made this possible was a feat of diplomacy and friendship — friendship,” Mr. Biden said on Thursday. In a veiled reference to former President Donald J. Trump, who constantly berates and belittles America’s European partners, Mr. Biden added: “For anyone who questions whether allies matter, they do. They matter.” No longer facing another election might have made it easier on some level for Mr. Biden to risk whatever political fallout there might be for the swap. It was an uncomfortable compromise. No one liked giving up a killer like Mr. Krasikov for innocent Americans like Mr. Gershkovich, the Marine veteran Paul Whelan and the journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, along with Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian opposition leader and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Washington Post who is a permanent U.S. resident. ADVERTISEMENT Trading for hostages always raises the tricky question of whether it encourages the hostage-takers to do it again. Unsurprisingly, Republicans quickly made that point, most loudly Mr. Trump, who is seeking his old job back and denounced giving anything away to free American prisoners. “To do so is bad precedent for the future,” Mr. Trump wrote on his social media site in a posting that did not even pause to celebrate the freedom for the Americans and others released. “That’s the way it should be, or this situation will get worse and worse. They are extorting the United States of America.” But in fact, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sullivan decided early in his administration that the old politics no longer applied and that they should be willing to make trades, when justified, to free imprisoned Americans. For all the predictable criticism that would come, they concluded that there was really no meaningful domestic political cost, nor was it clear that refusing to make deals would necessarily stop hostage taking. In that case, they reasoned that it was better just to get Americans home rather than stand on what they considered a pointless principle and leave innocent people wasting away in foreign prisons or terrorist sanctuaries. They did so for Trevor R. Reed, an ailing former U.S. Marine held in Russia on what his family called bogus charges of assault, and they did so again for Brittney Griner, the W.N.B.A. star arrested in Moscow on what U.S. officials considered trumped-up drug charges. Left out of all those deals, though, was Marc Fogel, an American teacher sentenced to 14 years in a labor camp after being found with medical marijuana. Biden aides said they would keep trying to free him too. ADVERTISEMENT When Mr. Biden appeared on Thursday with the families of Mr. Gershkovich and the others, he laughed off a claim by Mr. Trump that if he were elected again, he would get President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to simply free American prisoners without receiving anything in return. “Why didn’t he do it when he was president?” Mr. Biden asked. With that, he headed out of the room. There was more to do. In fact, he had another important phone call to make, this one with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. There were, after all, more crises to confront, more hostages to try to free and not much time left. Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.

"The Pennsylvania governor, a top contender to be Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, wrote in his college newspaper that Palestinians were “too battle-minded.”","Palestinians ‘too battle-minded’: Gov. Shapiro’s college article prompts backlash  Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s college newspaper article from 1993 resurfaced this week and has caused considerable backlash - with some taking offense to his claim that Palestinians are “too battle-minded” to coexist with Israel, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.  Shapiro has made a number of headlines recently as he is thought to be among Vice President Kamala Harris's picks for a potential running mate in her presidential bid. The article ‘Peace not possible,’ published in the University of Rochester’s Campus Times, is now three decades old. It expressed opinions contradicting the official’s current stance. One key issue is that he now claims to support a two-state solution and, by extension, the establishment of a Palestinian state. At 20 years old, Shapiro claimed, “Using history as precedent, peace between Arabs and Israelis is virtually impossible and will never come.” “Palestinians will not coexist peacefully,” Shapiro wrote. “They do not have the capabilities to establish their own homeland and make it successful even with the aid of Israel and the United States. They are too battle-minded to be able to establish a peaceful homeland of their own.” The article pre-dated Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, which was subsequently taken over by the Hamas terror group. The article also predated the signing of the Abraham Accords. Shapiro’s spokesperson, Manuel Bonder, told the Inquirer that the governor’s stance has changed and confirmed that Shapiro fully backs a two-state solution. “Governor Shapiro has built close, meaningful, informative relationships with many Muslim-American, Arab-American, Palestinian Christian, and Jewish community leaders all across Pennsylvania,” Bonder said. “The governor greatly values their perspectives and the experiences he has learned from over the years — and as a result, as with many issues, his views on the Middle East have evolved into the position he holds today.” “I was 20,” Shapiro said at a conference in Delaware County. “I have said for years, years before October 7, that I favor a two-state solution — Israelis and Palestinians living peacefully side-by-side, being able to determine their own futures and their own destiny.”","1.

"The Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller investigated whether a Trump adviser was part of an Egyptian plan, never proven, to funnel $10 million to the 2016 Trump campaign.","House Democrats ask Trump if he illegally accepted $10 million from Egypt  A recent Washington Post article detailed a now-closed Justice Department investigation spurred by intelligence from 2016 indicating that the Egyptian president sought to give Donald Trump money. Democratic leaders on the House Oversight Committee released a letter Tuesday asking former president Donald Trump if he ever illegally received money from the government of Egypt, and whether money from Cairo played a role in a $10 million infusion into his 2016 run for president. Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, and Rep. Robert Garcia (Calif.), the top Democrat on its subcommittee for national security, the border and foreign affairs, wrote to Trump that they were making the request as a result of a Washington Post article published last month. The article revealed details of a secret Justice Department investigation during Trump’s presidency into whether he took an illegal campaign contribution from Egypt. As members of the House minority, Raskin and Garcia do not have the power to subpoena documents or witnesses, and Trump is under no obligation to respond to their inquiries. But the Democrats said the public deserves answers now that Trump is running for president again. “Surely you would agree that the American people deserve to know whether a former president — and a current candidate for president — took an illegal campaign contribution from a brutal foreign dictator,” the letter signed by the two Democrats reads. “Accordingly, we request that you immediately provide the Committee with information and documents necessary to assure the Committee and the American public that you never, directly or indirectly, politically or personally, received any fund from the Egyptian president or government.” Asked for comment, the Trump campaign called reporting about Trump and Egypt “textbook Fake News.” The Justice Department investigation “found no wrongdoing and was closed,” spokesman Steven Cheung said, repeating a statement he gave for The Post story last month. “None of the allegations or insinuations being reported on have any basis in fact.” The Post article reported that the investigation began early in 2017 in response to U.S. intelligence indicating that Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi had sought to send Trump $10 million. In May of that year, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who had been appointed to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, agreed to take the lead on the Egypt investigation. In early 2019, as Mueller was preparing to deliver his report on Russian interference and close his office, his team obtained records from Egyptian banking officials. The records revealed a cash withdrawal of nearly $10 million — an amount almost identical to what the intelligence indicated — from an account tied to the Egyptian General Intelligence Service, The Post reported. The withdrawal occurred in January 2017, five days before Trump took office. The discovery intensified the probe. Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in D.C. who took over the case from Mueller proposed subpoenaing Trump’s bank records from a period that included Trump’s first months in the White House to see if any of the money from Cairo could be seen landing in Trump’s accounts, The Post reported. But months after the handoff, The Post’s investigation found, prosecutors and FBI agents were blocked by top Justice Department officials from obtaining those records. The case ground to a halt by the fall of 2019 as Trump’s then-attorney general, William P. Barr, raised doubts about whether there was sufficient evidence to continue the probe. Michael Sherwin, the then-acting U.S. attorney who closed the case, told The Post he did so for lack of evidence. Though the $10 million Trump injected into his election bid in 2016 was reported as a contribution, Trump privately signed papers to structure the funding as a loan, according to FBI interviews with campaign aides. BuzzFeed News later reported that aides said the president forgave the loan after taking office. The letter Democrats released Tuesday asks Trump to name the source of any funds he used to repay himself for that forgiven loan, if he did, and to name any individuals or entities who were involved in funding, arranging or transferring money for the original loan to his campaign or its repayment. Raskin and Garcia emphasized in the letter that the General Intelligence Service, Egypt’s intelligence agency and a key entity under scrutiny in the Justice Department investigation of Trump, has been implicated by U.S. prosecutors in an effort to corruptly buy influence with another prominent U.S. official, former senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey. General Intelligence Service leaders helped fund cash bribes to Menendez through an Egyptian American business. Menendez was convicted in July on charges of accepting bribes and acting as an unregistered foreign agent of Egypt.

Olympic Champion Simone Biles Posted on Social Media That She Loves her ‘Black Job’,"Simone Biles says she loves her ‘black job,’ an apparent clapback at Donald Trump   After the final Olympic Gold winner Simone Biles said three years ago she wasn’t sure whether she could compete again, but that she had “worked really hard, mentally and physically” with the help of her team.   Olympic gymnastics champion Simone Biles entered the fray of the U.S. presidential race on Friday with a post that appears to clap back at former President Donald Trump’s comment about “Black jobs.” “I love my black job,” Biles posted on X, in response to a post from singer Ricky Davila, who had said: “Iconic photo of the GOAT mastering her black job and collecting Gold Medals.” The exchange came hours after Biles held off Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade to win the all-around Paris Olympics gymnastics finals, taking home her ninth gold medal. At 27, she’s the oldest Olympic women’s gymnastics champ since 1952. Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has been criticized for arguing during his June debate with Democratic President Joe Biden that migrants are taking “Black jobs” and “Hispanic jobs” from Americans. Trump’s remark angered critics, who called it a racist and insulting attempt to expand his appeal beyond his white conservative base. When pushed by moderators on what constituted a “Black job,” Trump told attendees at this week’s National Association of Black Journalists conference that “a Black job is anybody that has a job,” drawing groans from the room. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has been critical of Biles before. During a 2021 Fox News Channel appearance, following Biles’ withdrawal from that year’s Olympics competition to protect her own safety in Tokyo — a self-removal that prompted an international discussion about mental health — Vance questioned why the athlete didn’t push forward.  “I think it reflects pretty poorly on our sort of therapeutic society that we try to praise people, not for moments of strength, not for moments of heroism, but for their weakest moments,” Vance, who was then running for his Senate seat, said at the time. Trump’s campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment on what Biles posted. Biles’ representatives also did not immediately return messages seeking further comment on her post or her thoughts generally about the 2024 U.S. presidential election. ___ Meg Kinnard reported from Chapin, S.C., and can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP.

Hunter Biden won’t be sentenced on gun charges until after presidential election,"Hunter Biden to be sentenced Nov. 13 after conviction on federal gun charges  Watch CBS News By Melissa Quinn August 2, 2024 / 3:30 PM EDT / CBS News Washington — Hunter Biden, President Biden's son, is set to be sentenced on Nov. 13 for his conviction on federal gun charges. Hunter Biden was found guilty by a 12-member jury in June on charges related to his purchase and possession of a firearm while he was addicted to crack cocaine. The trial in his case, brought by special counsel David Weiss, spanned six days. The jury heard testimony from Hunter Biden's ex-wife; an ex-girlfriend; Hallie Biden, widow of his deceased brother Beau Biden; and as his daughter, Naomi Biden. He faces up to 25 years in prison and fines of up to $750,000. Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of a crime. He is a first-time offender. The president's son was indicted on three felony gun charges in September 2023 after a proposed plea deal with federal prosecutors unraveled. He was accused of buying and having a gun, a Colt Cobra 38SPL, for 11 days in October 2018 when he was a drug user, and lying about his drug use on a federal form for firearms purchases. Federal law prohibits illegal drug users from having guns. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his lawyers argued during the trial that prosecutors had to prove he was using drugs when he purchased the gun. His defense team said he was abusing alcohol, not drugs, during the time that he had the weapon. Ultimately, the argument did not persuade the jury, who returned a guilty verdict after deliberating for less than three hours across two hours. Hunter Biden will be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who has overseen the case. The Nov. 13 date for the proceedings is just eight days after the presidential election. He is also set to stand trial in California, where he faces nine federal tax charges in a second case brought by Weiss. He was indicted in December and pleaded not guilty to the six misdemeanor counts and three felony counts. The trial in that case is set to begin Sept. 5.

"‘There was no excitement. Now, there’s tons’: How Harris’ candidacy has energized plans for the DNC","From a 'wake' to 'Mardi Gras': With Harris, the Democratic convention is a hot ticket  DEVELOPING: Four killed in shooting at Georgia high school, suspect is in custody         CHICAGO — Energy is exploding around the Democratic National Convention, with tickets, venues and hotel rooms spiking in demand as Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to become the first Black and Asian American woman to formally accept a major-party nomination. Credentials are at a premium. Events are growing in size and number. Some corporate clients are sending more people, while others are extending their stays. Since Harris moved to the top of the Democratic ballot, a deluge of new requests has flooded in for entry into the main event space at the United Center and surrounding bashes, people close to the convention and event-planning say. Chris Korge, national finance chair for the Democratic National Committee, who has worked in Democratic presidential politics for decades, said he’s fielding streams of calls and texts of last-minute requests for entry around the four-day convention, which starts Aug. 19.   “A credential to get into the Chicago Democratic National Convention is a hotter ticket than a Taylor Swift concert,” Korge said. “We have to tell people there’s a limit to how many people we can get into the convention.” Demand around the convention mirrors the ebullience the party is experiencing since President Joe Biden stepped aside from seeking the party’s nomination on July 21. Harris, who announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday, is riding a wave of momentum. She has packed arenas the last few weeks — a new phenomenon for the campaign. Harris’ campaign reported raising an eye-popping $310 million last month, more than double what former President Donald Trump’s campaign had raised. In one week, 360,000 people signed up to volunteer for Harris.  It’s all a marked shift from the days and weeks after Biden’s devastating debate with Trump in late June. As fundraising for Biden began to falter across the board, there was talk about canceling events around the convention, said Jaimey Sexton, a Chicago-based consultant with the Sexton Group who has booked or helped arrange multiple events around the convention.  Now, he said, he’s hard-pressed to help find a proper dinner spot for a group of 20 people.  “Before it was going to be a wake; now it’s going to be Mardi Gras,” Sexton said. “Normally, this stuff would have been coming together six weeks ago. But everyone was paralyzed; no one had money to do anything.” After Harris stepped into Biden’s role at the top of the Democratic ticket, demand accelerated, he said. “Now it’s just a scramble,” he said, to accommodate all the new requests.  A person close to convention planning said that to some degree, it’s typical for people to come out of the woodwork two weeks before a convention trying to get tickets. And after Covid sidetracked live events in 2020, there was steady enthusiasm to hold the first real Democratic convention since 2016. The Chicago Host Committee closed its call for convention volunteers at the end of July after it received applications or interest forms from 30,000 people. It surpassed its goal of 12,000 in mid-July, before the change of nominee, a spokesperson said. Still, consultants, event planners, activists and delegates say they’re experiencing a spike in interest since Harris took the reins. The host for one event specifically asked that it not be publicized for fear it would swell beyond capacity.  Talk of bartering tickets for event entry is already underway, said Greg Goldner, founder and managing partner of Resolute Public Affairs.   Goldner said some of his corporate clients are sending more people for longer stays than anticipated, candidates competing in November who had planned to attend only a couple of days are extending their trips, and new entertainment and events are popping up. Finding a hotel room is still possible — Chicago can accommodate conventions of 100,000 people, and the convention is estimated to bring in 50,000 — but prices aren't cheap, he said.   “The informal economy around access and who can trade what is going to be at its finest,” Goldner said. “The centralized calendar is now a massive spreadsheet that is increasing every single day. … You’re starting to see a lot of new events that are going to be fun.”  Illinois State Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who is also a delegate, is among those who has been bombarded with requests for help landing convention credentials.  “Enthusiasm is off the charts right now. We really feel massive momentum going into this convention,” Mendoza said. “My phone has literally been ringing in an insane way, with people asking me if I have extra tickets to the convention. They are so hard to come by, which is clearly a sign of the excitement.”    Kim Walz, a longtime Democratic activist in Chicago and onetime aldermanic candidate, said the last few weeks have been transformative for her and others in the party. “There has been so much divisiveness that I wanted just to tune it all out — and I’m a pretty engaged person.

Trump’s political operation says it raised nearly $139 million in July,"Trump campaign reports raising $137 million in July, falling short of Harris’ first-week total   Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally, Wednesday, July 31, 2024, in Harrisburg, Pa. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican former President Donald Trump ‘s campaign and its related affiliates announced Thursday that they had raised $138.7 million last month — less than what his new opponent in November’s election, Vice President Kamala Harris, took in during her White House bid’s opening week. Trump’s campaign says it has $327 million in cash on hand heading into August, with the election now just a bit more than three months away. Harris’ campaign has yet to announce its July fundraising totals or say how much it has in campaign funds, but it says the vice president’s entry into the race has sparked a wave of new donations and volunteers. The former president’s campaign, the Republican National Committee and other entities previously announced raising $331 million in the three-month period that ended in June — meaning their July totals were above that pace. They may have been helped by Trump surviving an assassination attempt during a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, which galvanized some of his supporters, and his subsequently announcing his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Some Democrats were once panicked about the party’s prospects of a November loss by President Joe Biden. But donors gave enough that Harris’ team announced it had taken in $200 million in the first week after Biden revealed on July 21 that he was abandoning his reelection bid and formally endorsing Harris.  The vice president has since intensified her travel schedule and unleased a flurry of advertising presenting her personal story and criticizing Trump. Some in her party who felt like Trump was favored in November after the 81-year-old Biden’s dismal debate performance on June 27 now see a new race with the 59-year-old Harris. Harris will become her party’s formal presidential nominee by virtual voting of delegates to the Democratic National Convention in a process set to conclude Monday, and she is expected to name her running mate around the same time.

Panel recommends Trump ally Jeffrey Clark’s law license be suspended over his role in efforts to overturn 2020 election,"Panel recommends Trump ally Jeffrey Clark’s law license be suspended over his role in efforts to overturn 2020 election   By Katelyn Polantz, CNN (CNN) — Jeffrey Clark, the Trump-era Justice Department official who advocated for the department to contact Georgia and cast doubt on Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss, should face a two-year suspension from practicing law, a disciplinary committee in Washington, DC, said Thursday. As an environmental lawyer at the Justice Department, Clark tried to push through an official letter to officials in Georgia after the 2020 election, urging the state to interfere with the election results. His superiors at the Justice Department told him no. The disciplinary committee found Clark included false and misleading information in the letter. “What Mr. Clark did was objectively reckless, but subjectively, the evidence indicated that he thought he had been chosen for a historic cause, to which he applied all of his energies,” the three-person hearing committee wrote in its findings. Clark maintained he believed he could send the letter to Georgia, and even took the stand in his own defense at the disciplinary trial. Then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Deputy Attorney General Richard Donohue also testified in Clark’s proceeding, saying the Justice Department didn’t find significant fraud in the elections even while Clark insisted it might. “His sincerity of belief does not make him less reckless,” the committee wrote in its findings. “To the contrary, we conclude that his personal beliefs blinded him from objectively assessing the facts and the reality of his proposed course of action, and caused him to rationalize a broader role for the Department of Justice, failing to distinguish President Trump from candidate Trump.” The disciplinary counsel that brought the case against Clark sought for him to face a severe sanction like disbarment, while Clark’s team wanted him to avoid being disciplined. The recommendation — laid out in a 213-page report after a quasi-trial proceeding — is an early step in the process of attorney discipline. If the recommendation is adopted, Clark would face less fallout than two other attorneys who may be disbarred for their work for Trump: John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani. The hearing committee wrote in its report that it doesn’t believe there was “clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Clark was as culpable” as those two, who worked privately for Trump after the election. “We cannot recommend sanctioning Mr. Clark from what might be true or what evidence was presented in other cases. We can only recommend sanctioning him for what has been proven in this case by clear and convincing evidence,” the report said. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

"Rajasthan tribal MP: ‘SC verdict will break unity among Dalits, Adivasis … if there is a big attack on quota in future, people won’t be able to resist’","Rajasthan tribal MP: ‘SC verdict will break unity among Dalits, Adivasis … if there is a big attack on quota in future, people won’t be able to resist’  Following the landmark Supreme Court judgment allowing sub-classification of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), Rajasthan’s INDIA alliance constituent Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) has announced its opposition to it. The party’s founder and Lok Sabha MP Rajkumar Roat, says sub-classification will lead to division within the SC-ST communities. Roat speaks to The Indian Express about why he thinks sub-categorisation will be divisive. Excerpts: * What is your take on the Supreme Court judgment? The situation of the SC-ST communities is different in every state. The manner in which this judgment was delivered, it (sub-categorisation) will serve to break up the unity among SCs and STs. If there is inequality in our state among STs, then our people, social organisations, MPs, and MLAs can sit together, decide, and submit a proposal to the government on what needs to be done. However, this SC judgment will break the unity among tribals and SCs. * Did any Rajasthan ST group demand sub-categorisation? There hasn’t been any such demand. In Rajasthan, there is indeed discussion on scheduled and non-scheduled areas when it comes to (jobs in) state services. But that can be resolved on the basis of the concerned areas, not by dividing the community. If you target the community then it will lead to conflict and that is what they (the BJP-led Centre) want. They are saying that they will give jobs to the weaker sections but how will they be identified? How will the government identify? * They also favour removing quotas for the creamy layer … Reservation has not been given for backwardness. The STs fought all the aggressors and it has been given based on their social identity. But the way they are defining it now (based on economic status) is incorrect. If this continues, reservation will be over in times to come. * What is your party’s position on the judgment? Our stand is that it has been brought for a particular community to fight within itself, which is wrong. We don’t support it. People in some remote areas haven’t yet received the benefit of reservation. Because of such cases, there can be a division of (existing reservation in) state services, between Schedule 5 and non-Schedule 5 areas, on the basis of population. Rather than target and divide communities, the division can be on the basis of the area. * It is said that some Rajasthan ST groups have received more reservation benefits than others… We do agree that this is true, but in Rajasthan, it can be addressed on a social level by the social and political leaders of the community. We will send such a proposal (to the state government). The government cannot identify that (because of political compulsions) but we can. * How do you see the judgment play out in the state? It will lead to divisions within SCs and STs and if there is a big attack on reservation in the future, then there may not be any struggle as the people won’t be able to resist it unitedly.

"Not cast in stone: Naidu govt mulls over removing Jagan images from boundary markers, passbooks","Not cast in stone: Naidu govt mulls over removing Jagan images from boundary markers, passbooks  During the recently concluded Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, the state Land Titling Act became a flashpoint between the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), with the former claiming that the system before the Land Tilling Act came into effect led to land encroachment under the previous regime and the TDP accusing the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led party of using the Act to grab land and property without the proper documents. After the N Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP alliance came to power, the new state government fulfilled its poll promise and repealed the Land Titling Act on July 24. Now, the Naidu government is contemplating removing Jagan Mohan Reddy’s photographs from the land boundary marker stones that were fixed during land surveys and from lakhs of land ownership passbooks issued as part of the Act. Naidu told the Assembly this week that the government would reissue the pattadar passbooks with only the official state seal. “The Jagan government wasted Rs 15 crore for printing his photos on the passbooks. The state government, as promised during the electioneering and as per the demand of the people, has decided to issue passbooks with the official seal. Officers have already submitted a copy of the passbook carrying the official seal,” said the CM. However, the TDP government is at a loss over what to do with approximately 77 lakh boundary stones with Jagan’s photo carved on them that revenue officials had planted. After the TDP stormed back to power, many farmers and landowners ripped out the stones, mostly because they disputed the land markings. The TDP’s Revenue Minister Anagani Satya Prasad claimed over 80% of land and property owners were unhappy with the YSRCP surveys and had initiated litigation. “We will be holding ‘gram sabhas’ in over 7,000 villages to ascertain if the land had been marked properly or not, and in consultations with the villagers, will conduct a resurvey if necessary and mark the boundaries accordingly,” he added. TDP ministers also alleged the Jagan government spent over Rs 600 crore to procure the boundary stones and carve the former CM’s image on them. “Though the Centre has never mentioned the issue of laying stones in the directions for the survey, Jagan prepared granite stones only for carving his pictures,” Satya Prasad said. Officials said that the exercise to re-issue land title passbooks without Jagan’s photograph, and the removal of the boundary stones with Jagan’s carving might cost up to Rs 15 crore. “The lakhs of granite stones that will be removed will be used for other purposes,” an official said. YSRCP spokesperson and former minister Ambati Rambabu accused the TDP and Naidu of levelling false allegations. “The land survey was done very scientifically and involved technology that ensured very precise marking of lands. The TDP had originally supported the YSRCP’s land survey but made a U-turn and opposed it. Even now, they are backtracking from their opposition by saying that they will conduct a re-survey, which means it will be a continuation of what the YSRCP government started,” he said. In October 2020, after the NITI Aayog, the Centre’s policy think tank, recommended the implementation of the Land Titling Act in all states, Andhra Pradesh became one of the first states to conduct land surveys to implement it. As per the now-repealed Act, all land and immovable property must be compulsorily registered with government agencies that will then issue permanent titles for them. The Act also provided a new system for speedy property dispute resolution by establishing tribunals. After the Act was rolled out, several property owners raised objections to the method of surveying lands using drones and geotagging, which resulted in discrepancies and disputes. During the election campaign, Naidu and ally JanaSena Party chief K Pawan Kalyan alleged that the YSRCP wanted to usurp land under the Act. In his public meetings, Naidu said the process of land surveys was full of discrepancies and that the people involved were not technically qualified to conduct such surveys.

Decode Politics: How a Yogi govt Bill ran into a wall raised by senior UP BJP leaders,"Decode Politics: How a Yogi govt Bill ran into a wall raised by senior UP BJP leaders  In another attempt to project a united front in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP ensured that both its Deputy Chief Ministers in the state were present alongside CM Yogi Adityanath at the Legislature Party meeting convened before the start of the Monsoon Session of the Assembly this week. Days later, that front is again showing cracks. First, the Adityanath government’s Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilization for Public Purposes) Bill ran into objections from the BJP’s own ranks in the Assembly, with City West, Prayagraj, MLA and former minister Sidharth Nath Singh and Prayagraj MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai expressing apprehensions over the legislation. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna even intervened while Bajpai was speaking to appeal: “Aap samajh nahi rahe ho. Pahle padh toh lo (You do not understand the Bill. First, go through it carefully).” BJP ally NISHAD Party’s Anil Tripathi then joined Singh and Bajpai in expressing his misgivings. Then, a day after the Bill cleared the Assembly, the Legislative Council sent it to a Select Committee for further scrutiny. The demand was first made by UP BJP chief and MLC Bhupendra Chaudhary, and supported by Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, who has launched a covert rebellion against Adityanath. While Adityanath in his capacity as CM is the Leader of the BJP in the Assembly, Maurya is the leader of the BJP in the Council. The BJP and allies enjoy a clear majority in both the Houses, which means that it is rare for a Bill to be sent to a Select Committee, that too on a demand made from the Treasury Benches. Nazul land is land originally acquired during the colonial period for specific purposes such as public utilities, administrative functions or for the settlement of displaced individuals. Over time, this land has been used or leased for various public and private purposes. As per the proposed Bill, Nazul land in the state will now be reserved and used exclusively for public purposes. Any court proceedings or applications requesting the transfer of ownership of Nazul land to private individuals or institutions will be cancelled and automatically rejected. In case payments have been made in anticipation of such ownership changes, the amounts are to be refunded. The government could choose to extend the leases of current leaseholders of Nazul land, provided they are in good standing, regularly paying rent, and have not violated lease terms. While BJP leaders as well as the Opposition say they have raised objections to the Bill in “public interest”, the legislation in fact replaces an ordinance that has been in implementation since March this year. The ordinance did not see any significant opposition when it was passed by the Adityanath Cabinet. On Thursday, when Chaudhary proposed that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee, even Opposition members were initially caught off-guard, not knowing how to respond. Even as the latter neither backed nor opposed Chaudhary’s proposal, other BJP leaders expressed their support for Chaudhary, with Maurya indicating it by raising his hand. The other Deputy CM, Brajesh Pathak, was seated next to Maurya in his capacity as minister. He could not vote on the proposal as he is a member of the Assembly and not the Council, but as soon as the decision was taken to send the Bill to the Select Committee, Pathak and Maurya were seen shaking hands. While the Bill saw a discussion in the Assembly on July 31, before it was passed by a voice vote, there was no discussion on it in the Upper House on August 1 before it was sent to the Select Committee. In the Assembly, noting that “governments work in continuation”, Sidharth Nath Singh suggested that those who have been residing on such land for ages and near the end of their lease should be given the opportunity to get an extension. He also suggested that with previous governments alternatively allowing freehold of the land or stopping it, those who continued to pay their instalments after freehold should also be considered. The Indian Express spoke to some members of the Legislative Council, where the Bill saw no discussion. They admitted they had not read the Bill, but added that they knew it would be recommended for Select Committee appraisal as “the public is against the provisions of the Bill”. They could not say what these provisions were. A BJP MLC said: “When the organisational head makes a proposal, we have to follow. He (Chaudhary) is not just a member of the Council but also the head of the state organisation. Even the Leader of our House and Deputy CM Keshav ji supported it. Many people have been approaching us against the provisions as it would displace poor people who have been residing on Nuzul lands for generations… The new law would have given the government the power to take it back at will.” Asked why they did not object when the ordinance was moved, the BJP MLC said he “did not know about that”. “We had to support sending it to the Select Committee, and we did.” About the surprisingly vociferous intervention by BJP MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai on the matter, Prayagraj Mahanagar BJP president Rajendra Mishra said: “Harshvardhan ji is a two-term MLA and always speaks his mind and raises his voice for the people.” He added: “Harshavardhan ji only speaks and works according to the policy and agenda of the party and government.” Bajpai is the grandson of Rajendra Kumar Bajpai, a veteran Congress leader and former Union minister who was seen as close to Indira Gandhi. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav Friday demanded the permanent withdrawal of the “inhuman” Nazul Bill. Taking a swipe at Adityanath in a post on X, Akhilesh said: “The Nazul land issue is entirely a decision to uproot homes because a bulldozer cannot run over every house… What will the BJP gain by demolishing settled homes? Will the BJP render people homeless for the benefit of land mafias?” On Thursday, soon after the Bill was sent to a Select Committee, Akhilesh said the BJP government wanted the law for “the personal benefit” of some people. “There are many such lands in Gorakhpur which some people want to grab to expand their sphere of influence… It is hoped that the Chief Minister will take suo motu cognisance and will not let any such plan succeed, especially in Gorakhpur,” he wrote on X.

"In with a chance in Haryana, Congress looks to set house in order, unify warring factions","In with a chance in Haryana, Congress looks to set house in order, unify warring factions  Having been hampered by a lack of unity in recent years, the Congress in Haryana is trying to bring together it’s warring factions as it prepares to face the Assembly polls — likely to be held in October — at a time when the ruling BJP is facing a 10-year anti-incumbency on top of the disappointment of having lost half the state’s 10 Lok Sabha seats in June. Giving the Congress hope is Assembly segment-level polling data from the Lok Sabha elections, which show that if the Haryana polls were held today, although it would result in a hung House, the Opposition INDIA bloc would come out on top as an alliance. Attempting to strike a balance between various factions in the state unit, the Congress has constituted a 45-member “strategy committee” that has members of every faction. All top guns of its Haryana unit, as well as their close aides, are there in this list. Chaired by All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge Deepak Babaria, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Udai Bhan is its convener. Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda is a member of the committee along with 42 other leaders. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting in Haryana Bhawan, New Delhi, on August 10 when Hooda, Kumari Selja and other warring leaders could be seen on the same platform for the first time in years. However, Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Singh Surjewala, considered the leader of one of the factions, appeared cautious, telling The Indian Express, “I haven’t seen the constitution of this strategy committee and nobody has informed me about it yet. As such, I am busy in Parliament these days and it is likely the session will get extended. I will only be able to say something on it when I see what this committee is all about.” Selja and Surjewala are the only two Haryana Congress leaders who are also party affairs in-charge for Uttarakhand and Karnataka, respectively. Surjewala is also a member of the Upper House from Rajasthan. Former BJP Union Minister Birender Singh, who recently made a comeback to the Congress, has also been included in the list. Besides Selja, MPs Deepender Hooda, Jai Prakash, Varun Chaudhary and Satpal Brahmchari are part of this committee as are at least eight MLAs: Bharat Bhushan Batra, Aftab Ahmed, Geeta Bhukkal, Rao Dan Singh, Jagbir Malik, Jaiveer Singh Valmiki, Rajender Singh Joon, and Bishan Lal Saini. Others on board include several former ministers and MLAs, some of whom had been voicing out their concerns, such as former Deputy CM Chander Mohan: former ministers Sampat Singh, Anand Singh Dangi, Nirmal Singh, Karan Singh Dalal, Rao Narender Singh, Capt Ajay Singh Yadav; and former chief parliamentary secretaries Anita Yadav and Ram Niwas Ghorela. All three working presidents of the Haryana Congress — Jitender Kumar Bhardwaj, Ram Kishan Gujjar and Suresh Gupta — are also there. Talking about the balancing act carried out in the committee, Deepak Babaria told The Indian Express, “Everybody shall be on the same platform and their suggestions, party feedback, etc, shall be discussed in this meeting. It is basically constituted to discuss the party’s future campaigns, strategy, issues that we need to raise, when and where and how, areas where we need to focus, etc. All party leaders are welcome to share their vision, feedback and suggestions with the sole motive of strengthening the party’s ongoing campaign for the upcoming elections.” On the question of who among Bhupinder Hooda, Selja, and Surjewala would be participating in the strategy committee meeting, Babaria said, “Hopefully, they will all be there. I have always said that dialogue is the key to resolving differences. They should meet more frequently and discuss the issues. Deepender (Hooda) is not the brand ambassador of our ‘Haryana Maange Hisab (Haryana demands accountability)’ campaign. It is a party campaign and he is going wherever he has a clout, or wherever local leaders are calling him. Similarly, Kumari Selja is also taking out the Congress Sandesh Yatra, which is also the party’s campaign. Each and every leader of the party can get out and raise these issues in areas where they have a clout. The core issue is mobilisation of the party cadre, and the people. If anybody is calling another leader of having taken over a campaign, it is incorrect. In this committee, all Haryana Congress leaders have been included and their suggestions, on how to strategise the party’s campaign and strengthen it, shall be welcomed.” Regarding factionalism, Babaria said, “I must say that self-interest serves as a catalyst. If anybody has an aspiration of becoming the CM, he or she must have at least 20-30 MLAs on his or her side. For that, every ambitious party leader will need to work hard, mobilise party cadres to first ensure that the party wins a majority. Rest, the high command and senior leadership decides.” Bhupinder Singh Hooda told The Indian Express, “It is good that everybody has been included in this committee. Everybody shall give their suggestions on shaping the party’s strategy and campaign for the elections.” Other party leaders said the committee would only focus on election strategy and won’t have any role in selection of candidates for the Assembly polls.

Several Dalit groups, excluding those who work in the leather industry, have been seeking quota within the overall 20% SC quota to help them avail the benefits of reservation. The Dalit A Mahapanchayat is one of them. However, the group that works in the leather industry and enjoys a level of affluence has been opposed, saying such a measure would hurt Dalit unity. After Thursday’s order, they said they would be meeting BJP leaders to demand that the status quo be maintained on the issue in Haryana. With the Assembly polls in Haryana coming soon, both sides realise that they can put pressure on parties to concede their demands. Dalit-A Mahapanchayat president Devi Das Valmiki said: “We will hold a big rally if a quota within the SC quota for government jobs is not given before the Assembly polls.” The Dalit A Mahapanchayat also believes it has a strong case because, in March 2020, conceding the demand of Dalit groups like it, the Haryana Assembly had passed a Bill creating a quota within the SC quota for seats in the state’s higher educational institutions for a newly designated “Deprived Scheduled Castes” category. This category includes 36 communities, such as the Valmikis, Bazigars, Sansis, Dehas, Dhanaks and Saperas. The Dalit A Mahapanchayat wants a similar sub-quota now for government jobs. According to government sources, the ‘Deprived Scheduled Castes’ cover almost the entire SC category, which comprises around 11% of the state’s population. Haryana was an interested party in the case before the Supreme Court as in 1994, the then Congress government in the state led by Bhajan Lal had bifurcated the SC quota into two groups – ‘Block A’, comprising the more deprived Dalit groups, and ‘Block B’, comprising the Dalits working in the leather industry. In 2006, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had quashed the 1994 notification, citing the decision of a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the E V Chinnaiah vs State Of Andhra Pradesh And Others case. On Thursday, a seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court overruled this order. Devi Das Valmiki told The Indian Express: “The current BJP government should have implemented the quota within the SC reservation in government jobs too when it introduced one for admission in educational institutions in 2020. After the latest Supreme Court decision, it should be implemented as early as possible, without delay. The ball is now in the court of the state government.” He called the Supreme Court decision a “lifeline” for them. “From 1966 to now, no one from our community has become a Lok Sabha MP from Haryana, even as the state has two seats reserved for SCs.” Devi Das Valmiki claimed that after the 2004 apex court order, “even the graduates or postgraduates from our communities did not get enough employment in the state”. However, the president of the Hisar unit of the ‘Dr B R Ambedkar Sabha’, Raghubir Sunda, termed the Supreme Court order “unfortunate”, warning that it could have “adverse effects for SCs”. “A significant number of government posts out of the 20% set aside for SCs are lying vacant in Haryana with the remark ‘not found a suitable candidate’. The Supreme Court judgment would just increase this backlog for government jobs. More government posts for SCs will fall vacant. Even in educational institutions, the representation of SCs has decreased after the implementation of a quota within the SC quota,” Sunda claimed. He added: “When there is no caste-based census, then how can such a decision be implemented?” Independent voices within SC groups called for unity among community members in “the larger interest”. A Scheduled Caste leader who did not wish to be identified said: “This is the time for unity among SCs for upliftment of the community members. We should not fall prey to the agenda of divisive politics, and avoid any conflict on the issue.” Click here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates","""Has the Haryana government proposed a law for 'quota within quota' for most-deprived Dalit groups in the current session?""",True,True,True

Uddhav Thackeray accuses BJP of indulging in 'power jihad'; hits out at Amit Shah,"Uddhav Thackeray accuses BJP of indulging in 'power jihad'; hits out at Shah   Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, 3 August, accused the former ally-turned-foe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of doing ""power jihad"" by breaking political parties to form a government. Hitting back at Union home minister Amit Shah for his ""Aurangzeb Fan Club"" barb, Thackeray dubbed the senior BJP leader a political descendant of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the Afghan king who defeated the Marathas in the third battle of Panipat. Addressing party workers at a rally in Pune, he also accused the Eknath Shinde-led dispensation of bribing voters by distributing ""revdis"" (freebies) to them under the garb of schemes like the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin Yojana, under which eligible women will get Rs 1,500 every month. Accusing the former ally of breaking parties, Thackeray said, ""If Muslims are with us after we explained to them our Hindutva, then we are (according to the BJP) the Aurangzeb Fan Club. Then what you are doing is power jihad."" Shah had dubbed Thackeray ""the head of the Aurangzeb fan club"" sitting with people who sought pardon for 1993 Mumbai serial blasts convict Yakub Memon, apparently referring to Shiv Sena (undivided) severing ties with BJP after the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections and joining hands with the Congress and NCP (undivided) to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. ""Amit Shah is the political descendant of Ahmad Shah Abdali. Even he was a Shah. That was Ahmad Shah and he is Amit Shah. Will he give us the teachings of Hindutva? You ate the birthday cake of Nawaz Sharif and we should learn Hindutva from you?"" Thackeray said. Thackeray had recently launched a sharp attack on his friend-turned-adversary and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, stating ""either you will be there or I will (in politics)"". Thackeray on Saturday clarified that he was not referring to any person. ""Some people thought I challenged someone, but I don't challenge bed bugs. 'I' means my cultured Maharashtra and 'you' means the party which loots Maharashtra,"" the former chief minister said. Bed bugs are not supposed to be challenged, but crushed, he added. Returning the fire, Fadanavis said Thackeray's remarks against Shah have established the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader's credentials as a member of the ""Aurangzeb fan club"". Thackeray asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to explain the leakage in the new Parliament building, built barely a year ago, instead of questioning Congress' achievements in the last 60-70 years. ""This government (at the Centre) is a leakage government. There are paper leaks also,"" he said. Thackeray accused the BJP of engineering division among castes and practising Hindutva taught by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. ""This is not the Hindutva taught to us by Chhatrapati Shivaji. This (the one practised by the BJP) must have been taught by Aurangzeb which we do not believe in. Our Hindutva is the one that takes forward the Maharashtra dharma of Chhatrapati Shivaji,"" he said. With a judgement on the disqualification of MLAs rebelled against him awaited, Thackeray took a dig, saying, ""We have faith in the judiciary. The result will surely be given in 5, 10 or 50 years"". Democracy is being murdered in broad daylight, he claimed and stressed that justice will be delivered in the court of the people. ""The term of (the legislative assembly) is getting over. Even if they (the rebel MLAs) are disqualified, they can contest polls. So have we got justice?"" he asked. Thackeray hit out at Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari with potholes emerging on roads in various cities during the monsoon season. ""Potholes are everywhere, including in Mumbai, Pune and other cities. Gadkari once said he will build such roads that even after 200 years there will be not a single pothole on them,"" he said. Given the condition of roads, Gadkari should be given the 'Khadde Purush"" (man of potholes) award, he said pointing out that the construction of the Mumbai-Goa Highway is still incomplete. Speaking at the event, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut claimed a ""sense of trust"" exists for Thackeray in Maharashtra. ""If we field 288 seats, we can win 160. Such (favourable) is the atmosphere in Maharashtra. But we are true to our word as there is Maha Vikas Aghadi).""

Middle East on knife-edge after alleged Israeli killing of Hamas leader in Iran,"Bomb Smuggled Into Tehran Guesthouse Months Ago Killed Hamas Leader   An explosive device hidden in a heavily guarded complex where Ismail Haniyeh was known to stay in Iran was what killed him, according to a Times investigation.   NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Ronen BergmanMark Mazzetti and Farnaz Fassihi Follow our latest updates on the Middle East crisis here. Ismail Haniyeh, a top leader of Hamas, was assassinated on Wednesday by an explosive device covertly smuggled into the Tehran guesthouse where he was staying, according to seven Middle Eastern officials, including two Iranians, and an American official. The bomb had been hidden approximately two months ago in the guesthouse, according to five of the Middle Eastern officials. The guesthouse is run and protected by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and is part of a large compound, known as Neshat, in an upscale neighborhood of northern Tehran. Mr. Haniyeh was in Iran’s capital for the presidential inauguration. The bomb was detonated remotely, the five officials said, once it was confirmed that he was inside his room at the guesthouse. The blast also killed a bodyguard. The explosion shook the building, shattered some windows and caused the partial collapse of an exterior wall, according to the two Iranian officials, members of the Revolutionary Guards briefed on the incident. Such damage was also evident in a photograph of the building shared with The New York Times. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Haniyeh, who had led Hamas’s political office in Qatar, had stayed at the guesthouse several times when visiting Tehran, according to the Middle Eastern officials. All of the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive details about the assassination. Iranian officials and Hamas said Wednesday that Israel was responsible for the assassination, an assessment also reached by several U.S. officials who requested anonymity. The assassination threatened to unleash another wave of violence in the Middle East and upend the ongoing negotiations to end the war in Gaza. Mr. Haniyeh had been a top negotiator in the cease-fire talks. Israel has not publicly acknowledged responsibility for the killing, but Israeli intelligence officials briefed the United States and other Western governments on the details of the operation in the immediate aftermath, according to the five Middle Eastern officials. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that the United States had received no advance knowledge of the assassination plot. ADVERTISEMENT In the hours after the killing, speculation immediately focused on the possibility that Israel had killed Mr. Haniyeh with a missile strike, possibly fired from a drone or a plane, similar to how Israel had launched a missile on a military base in Isfahan in April.  That missile theory raised questions about how Israel might have been able to evade Iranian air defense systems again to execute such a brazen airstrike in the capital. As it turns out, the assassins were able to exploit a different kind of gap in Iran’s defenses: a lapse in the security of a supposedly tightly guarded compound that allowed a bomb to be planted and to remain hidden for many weeks before it would eventually be triggered. Such a breach, three Iranian officials said, was a catastrophic failure of intelligence and security for Iran and a tremendous embarrassment for the Guards, which uses the compound for retreats, secret meetings and housing prominent guests like Mr. Haniyeh. ADVERTISEMENT How the bomb was stashed in the guesthouse remained unclear. The Middle Eastern officials said that the planning for the assassination took months and required extensive surveillance of the compound. The two Iranian officials who described the nature of the assassination said they did not know how or when the explosives were planted in the room. Israel decided to carry out the assassination outside Qatar, where Mr. Haniyeh and other senior members of Hamas’s political leadership live. The Qatari government has been mediating the negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a cease-fire in Gaza. The deadly blast early Wednesday shattered windows and collapsed a portion of the wall of the compound, photographs showed and the Iranian officials said. It appeared to do minimal damage beyond the building itself, as a missile probably would have done. At around 2 a.m. local time, the device exploded, according to the Middle Eastern officials, including the Iranians. Startled building staff members, the officials said, ran to find the source of the tremendous noise, leading them to the room where Mr. Haniyeh was staying with a bodyguard. The compound is staffed with a medical team which rushed to the room immediately after the explosion. The team declared that Mr. Haniyeh had died immediately. The team tried to revive the bodyguard, but he, too, was dead. ADVERTISEMENT The leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, was staying next door, two of the Iranian officials said. His room was not badly damaged, suggesting precise planning in the targeting of Mr. Haniyeh. Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy commander of Hamas in the Gaza Strip who was also in Tehran, arrived at the scene and saw his colleague’s body, according to the five Middle Eastern officials. Among the people immediately notified, said the three Iranian officials, was Gen. Ismail Ghaani, the commander in chief of the Quds Force, the overseas arm of the Revolutionary Guards, which works closely with Iranian allies in the region, including Hamas and Hezbollah. He notified Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in the middle of the night, waking him up, the officials said. Four hours after the blast, the Revolutionary Guards issued a statement that Mr. Haniyeh had been killed. By 7 a.m., Mr. Khamenei had summoned the members of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council to his compound for an emergency meeting, at which he issued an order to strike Israel in retaliation, according to the three Iranian officials. ADVERTISEMENT Tehran had already been under heightened security because of the inauguration of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, with senior government officials, military commanders and dignitaries from 86 countries gathering at Parliament in central Tehran for the ceremony. Mr. Haniyeh had looked cheerful and triumphant on Tuesday during the swearing in, hugging the new president after he delivered his inaugural speech, and the two men raised their hands together, making the victory sign. In Iran, the method of assassination was the subject of rumor and dispute. The Tasnim News Agency, the media outlet for the Guards, reported that witnesses said an object like a missile had hit the window of Mr. Haniyeh’s room and exploded. But the two Iranian officials, the members of the Guards briefed on the attack, confirmed that the explosion had taken place inside Mr. Haniyeh’s room, and said that an initial investigation showed that the explosives had been placed there sometime in advance. ADVERTISEMENT They described the attack’s precision and sophistication as similar in tactic to the remote controlled A.I. robot weapon that Israel used to assassinate Iran’s top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. Israeli assassination operations outside of the country are primarily carried out by Mossad, the country’s foreign intelligence service. David Barnea, the head of Mossad, said in January that his service was “obliged” to hunt down the leaders of Hamas, the group behind the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel. “It will take time, as it took after the massacre in Munich, but our hands will catch them wherever they are,” Mr. Barnea said, referring to the killing of Israeli athletes by terrorists at the 1972 Olympics.

Elon Musk attends Netanyahu’s speech to Congress as his guest; dozens of members skip,"Elon Musk attends Netanyahu’s speech to Congress as his guest, but dozens of lawmakers skip it                                                                                                                      Elon Musk made a surprise appearance in Washington Wednesday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress, attending the event as Netanyahu’s guest. Musk sat in Netanyahu’s private box in the visitors gallery above the House floor, alongside Netanyahu’s wife Sara, several Israeli soldiers and at least one former hostage of Hamas. The Tesla Motors CEO’s visit to Capitol Hill came a day after he announced on X that his satellite internet company Starlink had been activated in a Gaza hospital, with the support of Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Nine months into the Israel-Hamas war and the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Netanyahu’s speech has become a lightning rod of controversy, triggering an eruption of protests in Washington. Shortly before Netanyahu was scheduled to begin speaking, U.S. Capitol Police announced they were “deploying pepper spray” against protesters who had “started to become violent” close to the Capitol. Netanyahu scolded the protesters in his speech, calling them “Iran’s useful idiots.” “These protesters chant from river to the sea, but many don’t have a clue what river and what sea they’re talking about.” Netanyahu said. More than 30 members of Congress did not attend Netanyahu’s address, many of them skipping the event in protest of the Israeli prime minister’s approach to the Israel-Hamas war. One of Netanyahu’s most vocal opponents in Congress, however, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., did attend the speech. At several points, Tlaib held up a sign that read “War Criminal.” The clear breach of House decorum reflects the deep and painful divisions in Congress over the prime minister’s leadership. Despite the absences, the prime minister entered a crowded House floor to loud applause and cheering, shaking hands with various lawmakers on his way to the podium. “America and Israel must stand together because when we stand together something very simple happens. We win, they lose,” Netanyahu said at the opening of his remarks. The Prime Minister expressed gratitude to President Joe Biden “for his heartfelt support for Israel.” “President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years,” Netanyahu said. “I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel.” Biden and Netanyahu are scheduled to meet at the White House on Thursday. Vice President Kamala Harris did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, a conspicuous departure from tradition. The White House attributed her absence to the demands of travel. Harris will have a separate meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday. Typically, the vice president presides over joint congressional sessions, but Harris is traveling Wednesday, as the newly minted Democratic front-runner for the party’s presidential nomination. Former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also skipped the speech due to his “duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for Vice President,” a Trump campaign official told NBC News. In the vice president’s absence, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., would usually take her place as the president pro tempore of the Senate, but she did not attend Netanyahu’s address for ideological reasons, according to NBC News. Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Md., presided over Netanyahu’s joint address. “The United States relationship with the State of Israel transcends politics and partisanship,” Cardin said in a statement to NBC News. “It transcends any one Israeli government or any one U.S. administration.” Though Harris attributed her Wednesday absence to travel, many of the at least 30 lawmakers said they skipped the speech to boycott Netanyahu. Several, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said they would instead meet with families of hostages held by Hamas or attend a panel on Middle East peace and security. “Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress. On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., among the loudest critics of Netanyahu as the war carries on. Wednesday’s speech was Netanyahu’s fourth address to Congress, the last of which took place in March 2015. While the Prime Minister is on Capitol Hill, he will meet with the top four congressional lawmakers: House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

Palestinian rivals Hamas and Fatah sign reconciliation agreement in China ,"Rivals Hamas and Fatah sign a declaration to form a future government as war rages in Gaza AP AUDIO: Rivals Hamas and Fatah sign a declaration to form a future government as war rages in   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the U.S., sparking hopes of a U.S.-led effort to mediate an end to the nine-month Israel-Hamas war. However, it’s come at a time when Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah agreed in Beijing to form a government together - a move Israel has denounced. The AP’s Joe Federman explains.         RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah agreed in Beijing to form a government together, the groups said Tuesday, in the latest attempt at resolving a longstanding rivalry that looms over any potential vision for the rule of Gaza after the war with Israel. Previous similar declarations have failed, raising doubts about whether the China-sponsored negotiations might lead to reconciliation between Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip for 17 years, and Fatah, the main force in the U.S.-backed Palestinian Authority that administers parts of the occupied West Bank. The two groups issued a joint statement announcing the deal but gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done “by agreement among the factions.” Both sides said the accord, which provided no guarantees, was only an initial step, and they promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in 2011 and 2022. Israel and the United States rejected the pact. The U.S. and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel — a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions’ own competition for power. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the declaration on “ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.” The agreement offered only broad outlines for how they would work together.  “There is an opportunity … but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,” said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs. The declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports opposing Palestinian factions have sought common ground in China-sponsored talks. One of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war. The unity efforts are motivated in part by Palestinians’ desire to offer a scenario for postwar rule. But Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it vowed to destroy after the militants’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive postwar vision of its own. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ’ Fatah has been deeply reluctant to share power with its longtime rival. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since. During the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and that it advocates for forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions. That government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government. Reacting to the announcement out of China, Israel’s foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place “because Hamas’ rule will be crushed.” U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, “We made clear we want to see the Palestinian Authority” with a governing role in Gaza, “but no, we do not want to see a role for Hamas,” which he said has “blood on its hands.” The agreement also underscored China’s attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,” said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Officials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN. In the statement, all the factions including Hamas said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Hamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel’s destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognize Israel. The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognized Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s. Those deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving the authority in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves. Many Palestinians view the authority as corrupt, out of touch and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination. The unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organization, including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson. “It’s a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,” he added. Hamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority. Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further “positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.” U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling postwar Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory.

"Biden announces new NATO aid for Ukraine, as his reelection campaign teeters ","Biden announces new NATO aid for Ukraine, as his reelection campaign teeters                                                                                                                      President Joe Biden announced new commitments to help Ukraine bolster its air defense against Russia in a speech Tuesday commemorating NATO’s 75th anniversary. “Putin wants nothing less — nothing less — than Ukraine’s total subjugation, to end Ukraine’s democracy,” Biden said. “We know Putin won’t stop at Ukraine. But make no mistake: Ukraine can and will stop Putin, especially with our full collective support.” The aid will include new batteries and components for Patriot missile systems, donated by the U.S., Germany, Romania, the Netherlands and other partners. Italy will donate an additional SAMP-T missile system. Speaking from a teleprompter, Biden said that more air defense supplies will be distributed to Ukraine in the coming months. The announcement comes over two years into brutal invasion of Ukraine led by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a war that has become a point of contention on Capitol Hill as lawmakers remain divided on whether to keep providing funds for Ukraine’s defense. Biden’s speech also served as the latest example of the split screen looming over the 2024 NATO summit this week: As the president holds high-stakes meetings with foreign allies, his political future in the U.S. Democratic Party is on the line. The president’s Tuesday remarks were another opportunity for him to assuage Democratic fears about his 2024 candidacy, following his disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump in June. Since then, cracks have emerged within the Democratic Party as some lawmakers, donors and strategists publicly urge Biden to bow out of the race and allow a new nominee to step forward. Earlier Tuesday, House Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., joined the growing tally of Democratic lawmakers officially calling on Biden to drop out. Others have expressed continued support for the president in public statements, while voicing their reservations behind closed doors. Even as some Democrats remain tight-lipped about their concern about the president’s electability, many have openly noted that this week’s NATO summit comes with added pressure given the looming reelection doubts. The summit presents a timely example of Democrats’ heightened anxieties about losing to Trump in November. The former president has said he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the 32-member military alliance if he won a second term. “Americans, they know we’re stronger with our friends and we understand this is a sacred obligation,” Biden said during his NATO speech. Since his June 27 debate fumble, Biden has held several public appearances to try and restore confidence in his candidacy, including a 22-minute interview with ABC News last Friday. So far, his public showings have not put Democrats’ worries to rest. “The president needs to engage in the kind of interaction with voters that will prove to those that are skeptical out there that he can do the job,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a Sunday broadcast interview about the week ahead. “If he can’t do that, then he has a decision to make.” Biden is scheduled to hold a solo press conference on Thursday evening, a highly anticipated opportunity for him to prove that he can carry on an exchange with reporters in an unscripted environment.

‘A kind of civil war’: Divided France on alert for unrest amid political earthquake,"France braces for potential political earthquake: a far-right surge. What to know about the election  For decades, there’s been a strong political taboo in France against a far-right party coming to power. Now, just weeks before the showcase Summer Olympics begin in Paris, the nationalist-populist National Rally is making its most concerted bid ever to do just that. In Sunday’s second and final round of voting, the anti-immigration, “French-first” party is forecast to become the largest in Parliament — although the latest projections suggest it will likely fall short of an absolute majority that would allow it to form a government. Whether or not opponents succeed in banding together to blunt its most ambitious aims, the National Rally will likely be in a position to harry and hamstring centrist President Emmanuel Macron, who assumed his post in 2017 and still has three years remaining in his current term. “It means that France is entering a crisis,” Gerard Araud, a former French ambassador to the United States, said after the far-right party cruised to first place in an initial round of voting June 30. Speaking on an Atlantic Council podcast, Araud called the situation an “unmitigated disaster” for Macron. Galvanized by the National Rally’s early triumph, other parties, including Macron’s centrists, have spent this week working frantically to prevent it from attaining an absolute majority, an outcome that would force Macron to install its 28-year-old leader, Jordan Bardella, as prime minister. WORLD & NATION  June 19, 2024 Even if the far right fails to meet that threshold, it could potentially cobble together a ruling coalition, or simply use its newfound clout to gum up the agenda of Macron, whose party until now held the largest number of seats. Here is some background on how France arrived at this chaotic political juncture. The parties are vying for 577 seats in the National Assembly, the lower and more powerful house of Parliament. The National Rally hopes to win at least 289 seats, which would allow it to form a government without needing coalition partners. The three main political blocs in the running are the National Rally; a coalition called the New Popular Front, which includes center-left and hard-left forces, along with environmentalists; and Macron’s centrist alliance. They came in first, second and third, respectively, in the June 30 first round of voting. For the coming round, various complexities in the French electoral system make predictions difficult. Because lawmakers are elected by district, the result does not necessarily reflect overall levels of nationwide support for a given party. WORLD & NATION  July 2, 2024 Macron, whose presidential term lasts until 2027, did not need to call a parliamentary vote. But three weeks ago, after the National Rally outpolled his Renaissance party by a 2-1 margin in June’s European Parliament election — a stinging but mainly symbolic rebuke — he said he wanted “clarity” about voters’ wishes, and called a snap election. Analysts said Macron apparently gambled, as he has in the past, that the French electorate would recoil from actually being governed by the National Rally, and that the outcome of the European election, which does not directly affect national governance, essentially amounted to a protest vote. The president’s decision, taken within hours of the EU vote result, stunned France. According to French news accounts, only a tiny coterie of advisors knew of the move in advance of Macron’s announcement. That inner circle did not include his prime minister, Gabriel Attal. It is a rebranded version of the former National Front, whose founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was a notorious racist who sought to trivialize the Holocaust. Marine Le Pen, the founder’s daughter, worked assiduously to detoxify its brand, putting an emphasis on bread-and-butter issues, distancing herself from some of the party’s most extreme stands and even ejecting her father in 2015. With her blessing, Bardella replaced her as party leader in 2022, though she is expected to run as its presidential candidate when Macron’s term expires in 2027. The French distaste for the far right has deep historical roots, dating back to the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II, which delivered many of the country’s Jews to death at the hands of the Nazis. Many here still consider Vichy a lasting stain on the national honor. It promises to cut immigration, increase police powers and give native-born French citizens preferential treatment over dual nationals and foreigners, together with other measures that critics say would infringe on civil liberties. In the past, the party has fiercely rejected the European Union, a position it has since moderated, but it still wants to work from within to weaken the powers of the 27-nation bloc. Marine Le Pen also has a long history of sympathy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the Kremlin has cheered her efforts to break free of what it calls the dominion of Washington and of Brussels, seat of the EU. WORLD & NATION  June 13, 2024 When he won election seven years ago, at age 39, Macron was the country’s youngest-ever elected head of state, a proud technocrat who set out to deepen integration with the European Union and make France a more attractive business climate. But he also garnered a reputation for arrogance and dismissing the concerns of ordinary voters, such as the cost of living and income stagnation, especially in disadvantaged rural areas. His move to increase the retirement age from 62 to 64 was wildly unpopular, spurring mass protests. Substantially and negatively. Macron has been a strong supporter of the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky as Ukraine tries to fight off Russia’s full-scale invasion. The French leader has not ruled out the possibility of sending French troops to Ukraine to help train its army; the National Rally would oppose that. Bardella has also said he would block France from providing Ukraine with long-range missiles that could hit targets within Russia. WORLD & NATION  June 8, 2024 In France, the office of the presidency wields the greatest influence and authority in foreign affairs and national security, but a far-right prime minister would likely seek to erode that dominance. Much of Macron’s tenure overlapped with the presidency of Donald Trump, with whom the French leader sought to build a workable relationship, although Trump’s successor President Biden was more of a natural ally. Trump’s domestic backers have expressed glee at the prospect of far-right ascendancy that would leave Macron weakened. Mainstream parties in the past have banded together to form a firewall against the far right, and they are trying to do so again. Leading up to second-round balloting, the National Rally’s opponents have embarked on “tactical voting,” in which candidates in some constituencies abandon the race to help boost non-far-right candidates. By midweek, more than 220 leftists and centrists had pulled out of their runoff contests. The strategy could produce a “hung parliament,” in which no bloc has a clear majority, which could lead to a prolonged period of political instability. No new general election can be held for at least a year. As the contest has narrowed, opponents have been mining social media accounts and old pictures of National Rally contenders, seeking to diminish their base of support or force them out of the race. One candidate dropped out of her local race after a photo emerged of her clad in a World War II-era cap like those worn by Nazi officers.

Iran elects reformist Masoud Pezeshkian in presidential runoff vote,"Iran’s presidential election of 2024  Iran in 2006: A Country at a Crossroads   Masoud Pezeshkian emerged as the surprise victor of an early presidential election in Iran, which was held in June–July 2024 after Ebrahim Raisi, a hard-line conservative, died unexpectedly in a helicopter crash on May 19. Raisi, one of the few figures trusted by both the security establishment and the regime’s clerical guardians, was expected to oversee the transition to a new supreme leader after the death of the aging Ali Khamenei (and perhaps become supreme leader himself), and so Raisi’s death has thrown a wild card into Iran’s future. The election was expected to place another conservative loyalist of Khamenei in power. But Pezeshkian, a reformist who was critical of the government’s response to the death of Jina Mahsa Amini in 2022 and a vocal supporter of the Woman, Life, Freedom protests, managed to outperform the conservative frontrunners. He won in a runoff against Saeed Jalili with 54.8 percent of the vote. The victory for the most liberal and Western-friendly president since Mohammad Khatami (1997–2005) came amid an era of historically low voter turnout and widespread dissatisfaction with the regime. After an especially tumultuous few years under Raisi, Pezeshkian offers the Islamic Republic a chance to restore public faith in Iranians’ ability to determine their own future and reset the country’s relations with the West. Pezeshkian will have a lot on his plate, including: Pezeshkian is expected to seek outreach to the West to return to a nuclear agreement and to set a more cooperative tone for Iran’s foreign policy, but he is not expected to diminish Iran’s support for Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthi movement, and other allies in the region. As an ethnic minority (Azerbaijani) from the northwest of Iran and a vocal critic of the government during the 2022–23 protest movement, he is expected to push for greater social and civic freedom, but it is unclear whether he will be able to effect any major reform. Reformists (eslāḥ-ṭalabān) seek to liberalize Iran’s political system and take a cooperative approach toward international relations. Reformists do not belong to an organized political movement but are loosely defined against principlists (uṣūl-garāyān; often called “conservatives”), who emphasize the need to safeguard Iranians from corrupting and foreign influences. It is important to note that reformists do not seek to undermine Iran’s system of governance and generally accept the main principles of its Islamic Republic. They embrace the political oversight of the clerical class (velāyat-e faqīh) and believe in fostering an Islamic society. But they tend to reject enforcing Islamic principles through coercion and prefer an open society with freedom of expression and other social freedoms. Reformists also favor democratic governance over autocratic rule and some activists call for constitutional changes to remove some of the powers of the supreme leader (rahbar), but reformist politicians rarely push for changes to the constitution. Pezeshkian was the minister of health (2001–2005) in the second term of Iran’s previous reformist government. The reformists’ agenda was generally stifled by standoffs with the principlists in the Majles (parliament) and, to an extent, Khamenei. As president, Pezeshkian will face a Majles with even fewer reformists than before and a majority comprised of members of the Paydari Front, a fundamentalist faction. The supreme leader is powerful, but the president matters. The president’s role as head of state is indeed diminished by the post of supreme leader, who wields broad oversight over policymaking, oversees the armed forces, and generally sets the agenda for Iran’s government. But the presidency is hardly a ceremonial position. The president is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Iranian government and manages relations abroad, even if policy does not always originate in the president’s office. Presidents throughout Khamenei’s tenure have set very different agendas. Mohammad Khatami (1997–2005) sought reform at home and outreach abroad. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005–13) pursued a strongman approach, ramping up security and taking provocative and confrontational stances. Hassan Rouhani (2013–21) prioritized economic stability and engaged constructively with the West to achieve the JCPOA nuclear deal. Each one had a different presidency, and each one faced tensions with Khamenei, demonstrating that the president has some agency. Not directly, but he does have significant clout in deciding who is eligible to be president. But Pezeshkian’s victory shows that Khamenei, who most analysts believe preferred Jalili, does not always get what he wants. The president of Iran is chosen by popular election, but electoral candidates are vetted by the Council of Guardians, a deliberative body that supervises elections to ensure that they align with the ideals of the Islamic Republic. In practice, this often means making sure that the candidate is loyal to the supreme leader and his vision. The supreme leader virtually determines the makeup of the council’s majority: it is composed of 12 members, half of whom are religious jurists appointed by the supreme leader and the other half of whom are civil jurists nominated by the Supreme Judicial Council (whose chief is appointed by the supreme leader) and appointed by the parliament (whose members are also vetted by the Council of Guardians before they can run). Following the presidential election, the winner must be approved by the supreme leader before taking office. Shortly after the election results were announced, Khamenei met with Pezeshkian and congratulated him on winning the presidency. Iran has universal suffrage, meaning all adult citizens are able to vote, and they can do so unimpeded. But the selection of candidates offered to voters has been considerably restrictive in recent decades, and the process by which the Council of Guardians determines a candidate’s qualification is opaque. In February 2024 former Pres. Mohammad Khatami said Iran was “very far from free and competitive elections.” He abstained from voting in parliamentary elections in March. Reformists, the liberal faction within the Islamic Republic, have been systematically disenfranchised from the political process since 2009, when irregularities in the results for the presidential election led to massive demonstrations across Iran. A high voter turnout appeared to favor Mir Hossein Mousavi, the reformist candidate, but the official results showed that the conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad had won by an implausibly wide margin. The Council of Guardians investigated and later confirmed irregularities; after a partial recount, it declared that Ahmadinejad had won nonetheless. In 2011 Mousavi was placed under house arrest for his continued criticism of the government, and in the 2013 presidential election the most high-profile reformist candidate, former president Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989–97), was disqualified. In the 2021 presidential election only conservative candidates were approved, and Ebrahim Raisi, whom Khamenei favored, was the only viable candidate. The lack of reformist and centrist candidates in both parliamentary and presidential elections has resulted in record low voter turnout in the 2020s. The qualification of one reformist candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian, in the 2024 presidential election was thought to be an attempt to raise voter participation and thereby bolster the election’s legitimacy. But after the suppression of the massive Woman, Life, Freedom demonstrations in 2022–23, few Iranians appeared to have faith in their ability to change the direction of the country through the ballot box. The first round of voting saw record low turnout below 40 percent—lower than the turnout in 2021, when Raisi was the only major candidate. After Pezeshkian earned more than 44 percent of the vote in the first round, voter turnout was near 50 percent, the highest of any election since 2017. Saeed Jalili, who serves as Khamenei’s representative to the Supreme National Security Council, and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who was this year reelected as parliament speaker after parliamentary elections, were considered the main contenders going into the election. Masoud Pezeshkian, the only candidate who was not in the conservative camp, won a plurality of votes in the first round, despite widespread voter apathy and record low turnout that were expected to disfavor him. Jalili and Ghalibaf represent two factions within Iran’s conservative strand. Jalili, who is perhaps best known for his role as the intransigent chief nuclear negotiator under Ahmadinejad, is a populist academic with extreme loyalty to the supreme leader. He represents the fundamentalist Paydari Front, which seeks to strengthen the dominance of the clerical class in Iranian policymaking and gained a majority of seats in the parliament after legislative elections earlier in 2024. Ghalibaf, a former mayor of Tehrān, is an establishment figure related to Khamenei through his wife. He is considered a pragmatist and a favorite of the Revolutionary Guards, whose pervasive presence throughout society and government makes their preferences impossible to ignore. Although Ghalibaf would not be expected to venture far from the policies of the Raisi presidency, he has indicated his interest in pursuing negotiations with the West to return to a nuclear agreement and have sanctions lifted. Jalili would be more likely to maintain Raisi’s hard line on engagement with the West—insisting on the importance of a “resistance economy”—as well as his ironfisted approach to domestic issues. Masoud Pezeshkian, who served as the minister of health under Pres. Mohammad Khatami (1997–2005), could drive some real changes to policy in Iran. He openly calls for greater social freedom, including equal rights for women and freedom of expression, and he was a vocal critic of the government’s response to the Woman, Life, Freedom movement after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini in 2022. He also calls for a return to a nuclear deal with the West in order to reintegrate Iran into the global economy. He will not be able to reduce the role of the supreme leader, however, who thwarted much of Khatami’s agenda when he was president. As the sole candidate representing reformists and moderates, Pezeshkian’s candidacy was considered a wild card in the election. He won the plurality of the vote against his splintered conservative rivals, but not enough to win outright in the first round. His chances to win in the second round depended on voter turnout, which ultimately saw the highest turnout in an election since 2017 but was still much lower than in elections before 2017. Pezeshkian struggled to convince apathetic Iranians that their vote can change the country, although many voters are believed to have turned out for Pezeshkian in effort to keep Jalili from becoming president. “I told him not to stand as I think it is not in his interest or that of the country” – Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in 2016 after former Pres. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked to run for president for a third time About 80 people registered for the election, but only six qualified. (Two of the six later dropped out of the race before election day.) Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the best known among the disqualified candidates. Ahmadinejad fell out with Khamenei over a power struggle during his second term, and he has since remained out of the supreme leader’s favor. Several moderate administrators and figures from Rouhani’s presidency have been disqualified, including Ali Larijani (parliament speaker, 2008–20), Eshagh Jahangiri (first vice president, 2013–21), and Abdolnaser Hemmati (governor of the central bank, 2018–21). The reasons for these registrants’ disqualification are unknown, other than the general assumption that Khamenei wants a president who is both loyal and conservative. Presidential candidates in Iran can only win an election if they receive more than half (50 percent) of the votes. Because there was no winner in the first round of voting, a second round will take place between Pezeshkian and Jalili, the top two vote-getting candidates, on July 5. The only other time that Iran held a second round was during the hotly contested 2005 presidential election, when Rafsanjani, a former president, and Ahmadinejad, a charismatic dark horse, each garnered just over 20 percent in the first round. Following that election, the reformist candidate Mehdi Karroubi accused Mojtaba Khamenei (the son of the supreme leader) and the Basij (a paramilitary force in which Jalili once served) of conspiring to influence the outcome. Masoud Pezeshkian, the reformist candidate, won the plurality of the vote in the first round of voting held on June 28. He defeated Saeed Jalili, the conservative who won the most amount of votes, in a second round that was held on July 5. One spring afternoon in 1997, the telephone at the New York Times bureau in Istanbul rang. I was then serving as bureau chief, and the caller was my boss, the Times foreign editor. An election was soon to be held in Iran, he said, and he had chosen me to cover it. “Get yourself a visa,” he told me, “buy a plane ticket, go to Iran, and then tell us what’s really happening there.” Trying to find out what is really happening in Iran has been a challenge to outsiders for centuries. This is a country whose history stretches back over millennia, one that has known both the heights of world power and the depths of poverty and isolation. In its modern incarnation it puzzles outsiders as much as ever. Its people seem to embrace tradition while they thirst for modernity. Their society appears both terribly repressive and vibrantly democratic. Iranian leaders have done much to stabilize and pacify the Middle East, but they have done at least as much to destabilize it and to try to dominate it. These contradictions, along with Iran’s enormous potential to influence the course of world events, make it one of the world’s most fascinating countries. In the weeks leading up to the 1997 election, I traveled across Iran and spoke to hundreds of people, ranging from government ministers to illiterate peasants. Like almost everyone who visits there, I stopped at places that evoke the country’s rich history, from the haunting ruins of Persepolis, the former royal capital that Alexander the Great sacked in 330 BCE, to the spectacular mosques and palaces of Eṣfahān. Everywhere I found Iranians torn between hope and fear, wanting to believe that their country could once again rise to greatness but deeply uncertain that it could. The election campaign perfectly reflected these competing impulses. One candidate was a colourless bureaucrat who had been handpicked by the ruling elite. One of his opponents, Mohammad Khatami, a former minister of culture who had lived abroad and liked to quote Western philosophers, was all but unknown and seemed for most of the campaign to be nothing more than a sacrificial lamb offered up for electoral slaughter. Then, less than two weeks before the vote, something happened that no one had expected. Khatami caught the imagination of his people. He told them Iran needed to change, open its society, and launch a “dialogue of civilizations” with the rest of the world. In the last days of his campaign, as defenders of the old order watched in dismay, he took on rock-star popularity, thronged wherever he went by admirers who chanted his name. He won the presidency in a landslide victory, taking 69 percent of the vote. The day after the election, I wandered the streets of Tehrān and found people giddy with joy and disbelief. All knew that they had scored a great triumph over the dour regime many of them detested, but few dared to guess what their defiance might mean. In a small antiques store, I found the proprietor engaged in an animated argument with his nephew, who was also his shop assistant. “This was a referendum about freedom,” the older man insisted. “The voters were saying that we’re tired of people snooping into our private lives. What we do at home is our own business. With Khatami in power, the government is going to stop telling us what we can read, what we can watch, and what we can do. We voted for change, and the government will have to give it to us.” From behind the counter his nephew smiled and shook his head in gentle disagreement. “Khatami is not the boss and never will be,” he said. “In this country the president does not decide. Maybe Khatami has certain ideas, but he won’t have real power.” The debate in that shop crystallized the conflict that shapes modern Iran as well as the outside world’s uncertainty about what Iran is and what it can become. Iran is a large and very proud country, acutely conscious of its rich heritage and unwilling to accept dictates from any outside power. It is also insecure and confused, its people deeply divided over what kind of society they want at home and what role they should play in the world. Iran may emerge from this conundrum as an outlaw nation, one that thumbs its nose at the world and pushes toward dangerous confrontations with other powerful states and groups of states. It also, however, can become an example of democracy and stability in a region that has known precious little of either. It is this dichotomy, this contradiction, this remarkable potential to shape the Middle East and the wider world for better or worse, that makes Iran as important as it is fascinating.","""Has Masoud Pezeshkian been officially confirmed as the winner of the Iranian presidential runoff vote by the Iranian government?""",True,False,True
Britain’s Labour pulled off a thumping election victory with just 34% of the national vote,"Britain’s Labour pulled off a thumping election victory with just 34% of the national vote                                                                                                                      LONDON — The U.K.’s Labour Party won a huge parliamentary majority in the country’s general election, but a quirk of the British electoral system means it did so with just 34% of the total votes cast. Results show that the opposition Labour Party has won 412 parliamentary seats of the total 650, with just two seats yet to be declared. This translates as roughly 63% of the total seats, but Labour has won just 34% of the total “popular” vote, while the Conservative Party has secured nearly 24% of that number. Meanwhile, smaller parties including the centrist Liberal Democrats, right-wing Reform U.K. and the Greens took nearly 43% of the popular vote but gained just less than 18% of the seats available. This was aided by the U.K.‘s “first past the post” system, where voters choose only one single candidate from their local list in each of the country’s 650 constituencies. The person with the most votes in each constituency is elected as a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons, the U.K.’s lower house. The party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons usually forms the new government and its leader becomes prime minister. Unlike in other voting systems, there are no second rounds or ranking of first- and second-choice candidates, meaning it can be difficult for smaller parties to translate an increased share of the popular vote into parliamentary seats. Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at AXA Investment Managers, said in a note released Friday that this election “marks a warning sign for the political system, [as] a large majority has been delivered on a little more than a third of the popular vote.” She pointed out that voter turnout was just 60% for this election. That represents the second-lowest turnout rate since 1918, after 2001, when turnout fell to 59.4%. This 7.6% fall in turnout from 2019 indicated a “broader political disconnect,” said Dickens. “The scale of Labour’s majority is as much an outcome of the peculiarities of our voting system and an interplay of split votes and the [collapse of the] Scottish National Party (SNP), rather than of a resurgence in Labour’s popularity,” she said. That said, Dickens added that the “vote has shifted to the left more generally.” “If the Labour government can govern over the next five years and deliver a recovery in economic growth, investment and individuals’ real incomes they should be well placed ... to see a genuine improvement in the future,” she said. Meanwhile, Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Marcoeconomics, said that investors will need to “chew over how the vote shares, right-wing Reform’s results, and voters’ willingness to shift political allegiance translates into policy.” Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party won 14% of the popular vote, securing just four seats. Wood said: “Normally a majority as large as Labour’s would guarantee more than one term as government. But Mr. Starmer’s majority is not as secure as normal given the voting dynamics.” He said that Labour “will likely need to move fast with policy changes to demonstrate they can deliver their promised changes.” — CNBC’s Jenni Reid and Holly Ellyatt contributed to this report.

"""Psilocybin permanently strengthens brain networks""","Psilocybin desynchronizes brain networks  An official website of the United States government   Preview improvements coming to the PMC website in October 2024. Learn More or Try it out now. The relationship between the acute effects of psychedelics and their persisting neurobiological and psychological effects is poorly understood. Here, we tracked brain changes with longitudinal precision functional mapping in healthy adults before, during, and for up to 3 weeks after oral psilocybin and methylphenidate (17 MRI visits per participant) and again 6+ months later. Psilocybin disrupted connectivity across cortical networks and subcortical structures, producing more than 3-fold greater acute changes in functional networks than methylphenidate. These changes were driven by desynchronization of brain activity across spatial scales (area, network, whole brain). Psilocybin-driven desynchronization was observed across association cortex but strongest in the default mode network (DMN), which is connected to the anterior hippocampus and thought to create our sense of self. Performing a perceptual task reduced psilocybin-induced network changes, suggesting a neurobiological basis for grounding, connecting with physical reality during psychedelic therapy. The acute brain effects of psilocybin are consistent with distortions of space-time and the self. Psilocybin induced persistent decrease in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and cortex (and DMN in particular), lasting for weeks but normalizing after 6 months. Persistent suppression of hippocampal-DMN connectivity represents a candidate neuroanatomical and mechanistic correlate for psilocybin’s pro-plasticity and anti-depressant effects. Psychedelic drugs can reliably induce powerful changes in the perception of self, time and space via agonism of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A receptor)1,2. In clinical trials, a single high dose of psilocybin has demonstrates immediate and sustained symptom relief in depression3–8, and addiction9. Taken together, these two observations suggest that psychedelics should have distinct neurobiological signatures corresponding to acute (intoxication) and persisting (after the drug has been eliminated from the body) phases. Acute effects of psilocybin include increase in glucose metabolism in frontal and medial temporal cortex10,11. EEG and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies of acute psychedelic effects have reported decreased signal power12,13 and functional connectivity (FC) with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), and LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) broadly across the cortex. These seemingly paradoxical observations of increased metabolism and decreased signal power are not understood. Persisting effects of psychedelics include increase in the expression of genes that contribute to synaptic plasticity14,15, and increase in growth of neurites and synapses in vitro16, and in vivo17–19. Network-level correlates of persisting psilocybin effects remain unknown in humans. Rodent models have suggested that the burst of plasticity in the medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus may be key to psilocybin’s antidepressant effects16,17,20. The medial frontal lobe and anterior hippocampus form core part of the default mode network21 and increased cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms22. Precision functional mapping (PFM) utilizes dense repeated rsfMRI sampling23–25 to reveal the timecourses of individual-specific intervention-driven brain connectivity changes26. The PFM approach takes advantage of the high variability in brain networks across individuals and high stability within individuals24. We applied the PFM approach to detail the individual-specific acute and persistent effects of a single high dose of psilocybin (25mg). Healthy young adults received psilocybin (PSIL) and methylphenidate (MTP, generic Ritalin, dose-matched for arousal effects) on different days and underwent regular MRI sessions (~18 per participant) each before, during, between, and after the two drug doses (Fig. S1A). Dense pre-drug sampling familiarized participants with the scanner and establish baseline variability. We found that psilocybin produced changes in brain network structure that far exceeded those induced by other state changes such as treatment with methylphenidate, or an auditory-visual task. Interrogation of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal revealed that the highly conserved spatial structure of resting BOLD fluctuations was dramatically altered by psilocybin. Finally, we identified a change in hippocampal-cortical connectivity that persisted for weeks after psilocybin and had normalized by the time participants returned for additional open label psilocybin doses 6+ months later. Psilocybin acutely caused profound and widespread brain network changes (Figs. 1a, S2, S3), greater than 3x larger than the effects of methylphenidate or other manipulations (task engagement = 1.30, methylphenidate = 1.51, high head motion = 1.46, psilocybin = 4.58, between person = 4.58). To put psilocybin’s effects in perspective, it helps to consider that the differences in an individuals’ brain organization on/off drug were as large as those between different persons (Fig. 1b). Brain-wide connectivity change (Euclidian distance) was calculated across the cortex and subcortical structures and effects of condition were determined with a linear mixed effects (LME) model. a) Top: psilocybin-associated network change (LME model, t-statistic). Middle: methylphenidate-associated network stimulant. Bottom: day to day FC variability (random effect of day). b) Whole Brain network change magnitude (Euclidian distance between brain-wide connectivity matrices) reveals that psilocybin produces much larger change than methylphenidate, closer in magnitude to between person differences. Vertical bars and asterisks indicate significance (p<0.05) for post-hoc t-test between conditions. c) Change by system (resting-state network), based on individualized Infomap parcellation. Open circles represent individual subjects, bars represent average magnitude. *Disruption was significantly enriched within the default mode network based on rotation permutation testing. d) Psilocybin Network Change across the bilateral hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (same color scale as panel a). In the cortex, psilocybin-associated changes localized to association networks. To assess resting state networks (RSNs, referred to here as ‘systems’) specificity, we ran a community detection algorithm on each participant and then compared network change between system, using a rotation-based null model27. Psilocybin-associated change was greatest in the default mode networks (Fig. 1c). By contrast, network changes associated with methylphenidate consistently localized to motor and action communities (Fig. S3). Individual-specific psilocybin-induced brain changes were consistent when participants returned 6 months later for a second psilocybin dose (correlation between change maps; r=0.67) (Fig. S2). In subcortex, the largest psilocybin-associated network changes were seen in DMN-connected parts of the thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and hippocampus (Fig. 1d)21,28,29. In the hippocampus, foci of strong FC disruption were in the anterior hippocampus (MNI: −24, −22,16 and 24, −18,16). In the basal ganglia, the largest FC disruptions were seen in mediodorsal (MD) thalamus and anteromedial caudate. In the cerebellum the largest FC disruptions were seen in the DMN29. To examine the latent dimensions of variability in brain networks across participant, drug condition, and task, we performed multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) on brain networks from every session24. Dimension 1 (Dim1), the dimension which explained the largest amount of variability across the dataset, largely separated psilocybin from other scans (Fig. 2a), apart from one session where the participant (P5R) vomited 30 minutes after taking the psilocybin dose and was not re-dosed (red dots on the left of Fig. 2a). The higher score on Dim1 associated with psilocybin, corresponded to reduced segregation between default mode, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and cingulo-opercular network – systems that are normally anticorrelated 30(Figs. 2c and S5). Subtraction of average FC during psilocybin minus baseline revealed a similar pattern of FC change (Fig. S5). To determine if this reflects a common effect of psilocybin that generalized across dataset and psychedelics, we calculated Dim1 scores for extant datasets from participants receiving I.V. psilocybin31 and LSD32. Psychedelic increased Dim1 in nearly every participant in the LSD and psilocybin datasets (Fig. 2d). In the scatter plots, each point represents the functional network from a single scan, plotted in a multidimensional space based on the similarity between scans. Replication scans are represented with open circles. a) Dimensions 1 and 4 are plotted for every 15-minute scan. In the top panel, points are colored based on drug condition. In the bottom panel, points are colored based on participant identity. Dimension 1 separates psilocybin from non-drug and MTP scans in most cases. Dimension 4 separates individuals in most cases and shows a small but significant before/after effect. C) Visualization of dimension 1 weights (top 1% of edges are projected onto the brain to show the connections most effected by psilocybin). D) In additional datasets with LSD (top) and psilocybin (bottom), psychedelic causes reliable change along dimension 1. By comparison, methylphenidate produced a decrease in connectivity between regions in the sensory, motor, and auditory networks (Fig. S5b), consistent with previous reports33 and similar to the effect of caffeine25. To verify that observations in our sample (N = 7) were generalizable, we compared our study’s stimulant effects to those in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study34 (n = 487 taking stimulants). The main effect of stimulant use on FC in ABCD was consistent with methylphenidate-associated FC changes in our dataset (Fig. S5b). To investigate how psilocybin-driven network changes are influenced by task states, participants were asked to complete a simple auditory-visual matching task in the scanner. Participants performed this task with high accuracy during drug sessions (Fig. S4). Engagement in the task significantly decreased the magnitude of psilocybin-associated network disruption by 43% (change (psilocybin + rest) = 4.58; change (psilocybin + task) = 2.59; unpaired t-test, P = 0.0041; Figs. 1b & S3c), suggesting that psilocybin’s acute effects on brain networks may be context dependent. The reduction of psilocybin-driven brain changes parallels the psychological principle of ‘grounding’ – directing one’s attention on sensory perception as a means of alleviating intense or distressing thoughts or emotions – which is commonly employed in psychedelic-associated psychotherapy35. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of context-dependent effects of psilocybin on functional connectivity and fills an important gap between preclinical studies of context dependence36,37 and clinical observations38. Evoked responses during the auditory-visual matching task were largely unchanged during psilocybin, suggesting that altered neurovascular uncoupling is unlikely to account for observed FC change (Fig. S4). We observed that the normally stable spatial structure of resting fMRI fluctuations was disrupted by psilocybin, making the FC desynchronized and disorganized (see video supplement). We measured synchrony of brain signals using Normalized Global Spatial Complexity (NGSC) – a measure of spatial entropy that is independent of the number of signals39. NGSC calculates cumulative variance explained by subsequent spatiotemporal patterns (Fig. 3a). The lowest value of NGSC=0 means that the timecourse for vertex/voxel is identical. The highest value of NGSC=1 means that the timecourse for every vertex/voxel is independent – indicating maximal desynchronization (or spatial entropy). a) normalized global spatial complexity (NGSC) captures the ‘complexity’ of brain activity patterns. It is derived from the number of spatial principal components (PCs) used to explain the data. Higher entropy = less desynchronized activity. b) Whole-brain entropy (NGSC) is shown for every fMRI scan for a single participant (P6). Psilocybin scans are shown in red. At right, increases during psilocybin were present in all participants (box and whiskers indicate quartiles and 99.7th percentiles for non-drug scans, red circles indicate psilocybin) c) Entropy within functional brain areas shown similar increases. d) Spatial entropy is visualized on the cortical surface. Psilocybin-associated increase in entropy was largest in association cortices. This was replicated in LSD data (middle; using data from Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) and corresponds spatially to 5ht2A binding density (bottom; borrowed with permission from Beliveau et al., 2017). Psilocybin significantly increased NGSC (mixed effects model with individual differences and head motion as random effects, p = 9.2e-7), with levels returning to pre-drug baseline by the following session (Fig. 3b- d). The increase in NGSC was observed at whole-brain and individual brain area levels (Fig. 3c, d), with the largest increases in association cortex and minimal chance in primary cortex (Fig. 3d). Global and local desynchronization replicated in an LSD dataset (Fig. 3d)32 and the distribution of these effects closely matched PET-based maps of 5HT-2A receptor density (Fig. 3e)40. To assess if persistent neurotrophic and psychological effects of psychedelics might be reflected in network changes weeks after psilocybin, we assessed network changes 1–21 days post-psilocybin (compared to pre-drug). Whole brain network change scores were small, and not significantly different from day-to-day variability, indicating that the brain’s structure had mostly returned to baseline (Fig. S2 and S3). The anterior hippocampus forms part of the default mode network21 and atypical cortico-hippocampal connectivity has been associated with affective symptoms22. The same region of the anterior hippocampus which showed strong acute FC changes with psilocybin showed persistent connectivity alterations in the three weeks post-drug period (Fig. 4a and Supplemental figure 7). This persistent suppression of FC between the anterior hippocampus and cortex was found in all participants (Fig. 4b; LME model testing change in RMS AntHippo-cortical FC with head motion as a random effect: p = 5.1e-5). a) Group network change (relative to baseline) t-maps, left hippocampus: top=acute psilocybin, bottom = persisting (2 weeks after psilocybin. b) All subjects demonstrated a weakening of anterior hippocampal-cortical FC post-psilocybin (p=5.1e-5; linear mixed effects model accounting for head motion and subject ID). c) Connectivity from an anterior hippocampus seedmap at baseline, post-psilocybin and change for an exemplar (P3). The red border on the right-most brain illustrates individual-defined default mode network. A decrease in hippocampal FC with parietal and frontal components of the DMN is seen. d) Timecourse of anterior hippocampus - DMN for all participants/scans (participant colors as in panel b). A moving average is shown in black. e) schematic of hippocampal-cortical circuits, borrowed from Zheng et al., 2021. As predicted based on typical connectivity patterns, FC between the anterior hippocampus and DMN was decreased after psilocybin (Fig. 4c- e). Timecourse visualization, after aligning psilocybin doses between subjects, suggests that connectivity is reduced for 3 weeks after psilocybin but returned to pre-drug by 6–12-month replication scans (Fig. 4d). This observation is compelling, as it localized to the anterior hippocampus, a brain region shown to demonstrate substantial synaptogenesis following psilocybin18. Reduced hippocampal-cortical FC may reflect increased flexibility of self-oriented hippocampal circuits. The synchronized patterns of co-activation in the resting brain are believed to reflect the brain’s perpetual job of modeling reality41. It follows that the stability of synchronized brain networks across day, task, methylphenidate, and arousal levels (but not between individuals), reflects the subjective stability of waking consciousness. By contrast, the much larger changes induced by psilocybin fit with participants’ subjective report of a radical change in consciousness. The large magnitude of psilocybin’s effects, in comparison to methylphenidate, suggests that observed changes are not merely a consequence of changes in arousal or a nonspecific effect of monoaminergic stimulation42. Multi-unit recording studies suggest that agonism of 5HT2A receptors by psychedelics does not uniformly increase or decrease firing of pyramidal neurons, but rather serves to desynchronize pairs or populations of neurons which co-activate under normal conditions43. We observed a parallel phenomenon at the region, and whole brain level. This may explain the paradoxical effects of psychedelic seen in PET FDG and fMRI: disruption of synchronized activity should produce a decrease in power of local fluctuations12,13, despite an increase in metabolic activity, and a loss of the brain’s segregated network structure32,44. This desynchronization of neural activity has been described as an increase in entropy or randomness of brain activity in the psychedelic state45,46 (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), and it has been hypothesized to underly the cognitive and perception changes associated with psychedelics. The dramatic departure from normal synchronized patterns of co-activation may be key not only to understanding psilocybin’s acute effects, but also its persistent neurotrophic effects. Changes in resting BOLD activity are linked to shifts in glutamate-dependent signaling during psilocybin47,48. This phenomenon, shared by ketamine and psychedelics, engages homeostatic plasticity mechanisms49 - a neurobiological response to large deviations in typical network activity patterns50–52. This response to novelty includes rapid upregulation in expression of BDNF, mTOR, EF2 and other plasticity-related immediate early genes15,48. Consistent with this notion, psilocybin produced the largest changes in the fronto-parietal and default mode network, brain systems frequently associated with neuropsychiatric disorders53. Psychedelics rapidly induce plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex and this appears to be necessary for rapid antidepressant-like effects in animal models. However, to understand the underpinnings of psychedelics’ unique effects, it is necessary to study the human brain. Advances in precision functional mapping and individual-level characterization enabled us to identify desynchronization of resting state fMRI signals and localize these changes to depression-relevant circuits. Novel methods to measure neurotrophic markers in the human brain54 will provide a critical link between mechanistic observations at the cellular, brain-systems and psychological levels. Such links will help answer fundamental questions about the diagnosis and treatment of conditions of psychiatric illness. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and procedures established by the Washington University in Saint Louis Institutional Review Board. All participants were compensated for their time. All aspects of this study were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) Internal Review Board, the Washington University Human Research Protection Office (WU HRPO), the Federal Drug Administration (IND: 202002165) and the Missouri Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) under a federal DEA schedule 1 research license and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04501653). Psilocybin was supplied by Usona Institute via Almac Clinical Services. Healthy young adults (N=7, 18–45 years) were enrolled in a randomized cross-over precision functional brain mapping study to evaluate differences in individual-level connectomics pre-, during, and post- psilocybin exposure. Participants underwent imaging during drug sessions with psilocybin (PSIL) 25mg, or methylphenidate (MTP) 40mg as well as non-drug imaging sessions. Drug condition categories were 1) before psilocybin (‘Baseline’), 2) Drug 1( methylphenidate or psilocybin), 3) between, 4) Drug2 and 5) After. A minimum of 3 non-drug imaging sessions were completed during each non-drug window: before (baseline), between and after drug sessions. The number of non-drug MRI sessions was dependent on availability of the participant, scanner and scanner support staff. Dosing day imaging sessions were conducted 60–180 minutes following drug administration during peak blood concentration55. MTP was selected as the active control condition to simulate the cardiovascular effects and physiological arousal (i.e., controlling for dopaminergic effects) associated with psilocybin (Griffiths et al., 2006). Usona Institute, a United States non-profit medical research organization, provided good manufacturing practices (GMP) psilocybin. Drug sessions were facilitated by two clinical research staff who completed an approved in-person or online facilitator training program provided by Usona Institute, as part of Usona’s phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03866174). The role of the study facilitators was to build a therapeutic alliance with the participant throughout the study, prepare them for their drug dosing days, and to observe and maintain participant safety during dosing day visits35. The pair consisted of an experienced clinician (lead clinical facilitator) and a trainee (co-facilitator).  Participants were invited to return >6 months after completing the initial cross-over study for an open label psilocybin dose (which we refer to as ‘replication protocol). This included 1–2 baseline fMRIs, a psilocybin session (identical to initial session, except for blinding), and 1–2 “after” sessions within 4 days of the dose. Healthy adults ages 18 to 45 years were recruited via campus-wide advertisement and colleague referral. Participants were enrolled from March 2021 to May 2023. Participants were required to have had at least one previous lifetime psychedelic exposure (e.g., psilocybin, mescaline, ayahuasca, LSD), but no psychedelics exposure within the past 6 months. Individuals with psychiatric illness (depression, psychosis, addiction) based on DSM-5 were excluded. Participants were scanned roughly every other day over the course of the experiment (Fig. S1). Imaging was performed at a consistent time of day to minimize diurnal effects in functional connectivity 56. Neuroimaging was performed on a Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) in the neuroimaging labs (NIL) at the Washington University Medical Center. Structural scans (T1w and T2w) were acquired for each participant at 0.9 mm isotropic resolution, with real-time motion correction. Structural scans from different sessions were averaged together for the purposes of Freesurfer segmentation and nonlinear atlas registrations. To capture high resolution images of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, we used an echo-planar imaging sequence with 2mm isotropic voxels, multi-band 6, multi-echo 5 (TEs: 14.20 ms, 38.93 ms, 63.66 ms, 88.39 ms, 113.12 ms), TR 1761ms, flip angle = 68 degrees, and in-plane acceleration57 (IPAT/grappa) = 2. This sequence acquired 72 axial slices (144mm coverage). Each resting scan included 510 frames (lasting 15:49 minutes) as well as 3 frames at the end used to provide estimate electronic noise. Every session included two rest scans, totally 30-minute resting-state fMRI, during which participants were instructed to hold still and look at a white fixation crosshair presented on a black background. Head motion was tracked in real time using Framewise Integrated Real-time MRI Monitoring software (FIRMM)58. An eye-tracking camera (EyeLink, Ottawa) was used to monitor participants for drowsiness. Participants also completed a previously validated event-related fMRI task initially designed for the purposes of modeling hemodynamic responses in the auditory, visual, and motor cortices. Two task fMRI runs were completed during a subset of imaging sessions. Task fMRI runs employed the same sequence using in resting fMRI, included 48 trials (24 congruent, 24 incongruent), and lasted a total of 410s. See supplemental methods ‘Matching task’ fMRI for details. Resting fMRI data were preprocessed using a in-house processing pipeline. Briefly, this included alignment, normalization, non-linear registration, removal of thermal noise using NORDIC59, bandpass filtering, and scrubbing at a movement threshold of 0.3mm. Tissue-based regressors were computed in volume (white matter, ventricles, extra-axial CSF)60 and applied following projection to surface. Details on rsfMRI preprocessing are provided in supplemental methods.  Surface generation and processing of functional data followed procedures similar to Glasser and colleagues 201361. For cortical regions and resting state networks, we used a surface parcellation and community assignments generated by Gordon & Laumann and colleagues27. See supplemental methods for further details on surface generation and cortical parcellation. For subcortical regions, we used a set of regions of interest (Seitzman et al., 2020) generated to achieves full coverage and optimal region homogeneity. A subcortical limbic system was defined based on neuroanatomy: amygdala, antero-medial thalamus, nucleus accumbens, anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus62. These regions were expanded to cover fill anatomical structures (e.g. anterior hippocampus)63. To generate region-wise connectivity matrices, time courses of all surface vertices or subcortical voxels within a region were averaged. Functional connectivity (FC) was then computed between each region timeseries using Fisher z-transformed Pearson correlation.  We identified canonical large-scale networks using the individual-specific network matching approach described in previously27–29. Briefly, cortical surface and subcortical volume assignemtns was derived using the graph-theory-based Infomap algorithm64. In this approach, we calculated the Pearson correlation matrix from all cortical vertices and subcortical voxels, concatenated across all a participant’s scans. Correlations between vertices within 30 mm of each other were set to zero. The Infomap algorithm was applied to each subject’s correlation matrix thresholded at a range of edge densities spanning from 0.01% to 2%. At each threshold, the algorithm returned community identities for each vertex and voxel. Communities were labeled by matching them at each threshold to a set of independent group average networks described in Gordon et al. 2016. In each individual and in the average, a “consensus” network assignment was derived by collapsing assignments across thresholds, giving each node the assignment it had at the sparsest possible threshold at which it was successfully assigned to one of the known group networks. See supplementary figure S2 and S3 for individual and group mode assignments.  Network change (‘distance’) was calculated at the vertex level to generate network change maps (Fig. 1a- d, Fig. 4) and a linear mixed effects model with wild bootstrapping65,66 was used to generate statistics on these maps. First, a distance map was generated for every scan by computing, for each vertex, the average distance between its FC seedmap and the FC seedmap for each of that subject’s baseline scans. Second, distance maps for every scan were labeled on 5 dimensions: Subject ID, MRI session, task (task/rest), drug condition (baseline, PSIL, between, MTP, after, etc.), and head motion (average framewise displacement). Distance maps and associated conditions were then used to solve a linear mixed effects model in which drug condition and task were fixed effects, and Subject ID, MRI session, and head motion were random effects. Wild bootstrapping in combination with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was employed to estimate p-values for t-statistic maps resulting from the LME model. To perform the analysis, a wild bootstrapping procedure was implemented, which involved resampling clusters or groups of observations rather than individual data points. A large number of bootstrap samples (B=1,000) were generated using the Rademacher procedure66, where the residuals were randomly inverted to disrupt any potential autocorrelation. Specifically, a Rademacher vector was generated by randomly assigning −1 or 1 values with equal probability to each observation’s residual. By element-wise multiplication of the original residuals with the Rademacher vector, bootstrap samples were created to capture the variability in the data. For each bootstrap sample, the TFCE algorithm was applied to enhance the sensitivity to clusters of significant voxels or regions while controlling for multiple comparisons. The value of the enhanced cluster statistic, derived from the bootstrap samples, was used to create a null distribution under the null hypothesis. By comparing the original observed cluster statistic with the null distribution, p-values were derived to quantify the statistical significance of the observed effect. The p-values were obtained based on the proportion of bootstrap samples that produced a maximum cluster statistic exceeding the observed cluster statistic. Significance thresholds were determined using alpha = 0.05 to control for the family-wise error rate. The combined approach of wild bootstrapping with the Rademacher procedure and TFCE provided a robust and data-driven method to generate p-values for neuroimaging data. This methodology accounted for the complex correlation structure, effectively controlled for multiple comparisons, and accommodated potential autocorrelation in the residuals through the Rademacher procedure. By incorporating these techniques, significant effects of psilocybin and other conditions were reliably identified amidst noise and spatial dependencies.  For analyses in Figs. 1b, 2, S2, S3, distance calculations were computed at the parcel level. The effects of day-to-day, drug condition (baseline, psilocybin, between, MTP, after), task, and head motion and their interactions were directly examined by calculating the distance between each functional network matrix. RMS Euclidean distance was computed between the linearized upper triangles of the parcellated FC matrix between each pair of 15-minute fMRI scans, creating a second-order ‘‘distance” matrix (Fig. S2). In this analysis, the two task sessions were concatenated to match the length of the 15-minute rest runs. Subsequently, the average distance was examined for functional network matrices that were (1) from the same individual within a single session, (2) from the same individual across days (‘‘day-to-day”), (3) from the same subject between drug and baseline (e.g. ‘‘PSIL v Base”), (4) from the same individual but different tasks (‘‘task:rest”), (5) from the same individual between highest motion scans and baseline (“hi:lo motion”), (6) from different individuals (“between person”). Post-hoc comparison between drug conditions was conducted using two-tailed t tests. A related approach using z-transformed Pearson correlation (‘similarity’ rather than distance) was also taken and results were unchanged (Fig. S2c).  The different conditions above were compared by calculating whole brain network change magnitudes as shown in Figs. 1b, S2, and S3c. These are reported in the text as normalized network change scores calculated using the following procedure: We (i) determined network change for each condition compared to baseline as described above, (ii) subtracted within-session distance for all conditions (such that within-session network change = 0), (iii) divided all conditions by day-to-day distance (such that day-to-day network change = 1). Thus, normalized whole brain network change values (e.g. PSIL v Base = 4.58) could be thought of as proportional to day-to-day variability.  We used a classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach to cluster brain networks across fMRI sessions, as described by Gratton and colleagues24. This data driven approach was used to identify how different parameters (e.g. task, drug, individual) affect similarity/distance between networks. MDS places data in multidimensional space based on the similarity (Euclidean distance; correlation-based distances produce similar results) among data points – where in this case a data point represents the linearized upper triangle of a given functional network matrix. Each separate matrix (from a given subject, task, and session) was entered into the classical MDS algorithm (implemented using MATLAB 2019, cmdscale.m). Multiple dimensions of the data were explored. The eigenvectors were multiplied by the original FC matrices to generate a matrix of eigen-weights that corresponded to each dimension.  To assess network specificity of vertex-wise PSIL network change values, we calculated average network change of matched null networks consisting of randomly rotated networks with preserved size, shape, and relative position to each other. Following Gordon & Laumann et al., 2016, we employed a rotation-based null model, in which a subject’s subnetworks were iteratively rotated a random amount around the spherical expansion of the cortical surface. The spatial autocorrelation of smoothed BOLD data means that small networks are more likely to contain a single connectivity pattern than large networks. To create such matched random networks, we rotated each hemisphere of the original networks a random amount around the x, y, and z axes on the spherical expansion of the cortical surface. This procedure randomly relocated each network while maintaining networks’ size, shape, and relative positions to each other. Random rotation followed be computation of RSN-average PSIL network change score was repeated 1000 times to generate null distributions of network change scores. Vertices rotated into the medial wall were not included in the calculation. Actual PSIL network change score was then compared to null rotation permutations to generate a p-value for each of 12 systems (resting state networks) that were consistently present across every subject’s infomap parcellation. For bar graph visualization of ‘PSIL Change by System’ (Figs. 1, S3), RSNs with greater change (p<0.05 based on null rotation permutations) are shown their respective color (as indicated in Fig. S3) and all other RSNs are shown in gray. We used a n approach previously validated to assess spatial complexity (termed entropy) or neural signals39. Temporal principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the full BOLD dense timeseries, which yielded m principal components (m = ~80K surface vertices and subcortical voxels) and associated eigenvalues. The normalized eigenvalue of the i -th principal component was calculated as where m was the number of principal components, λ i and λ i represented the eigenvalue and the normalized eigenvalue of the i -th principal component respectively. Lastly, the NGSC, defined as the normalized entropy of normalized eigenvalues, was computed using the equation:  The NGSC computed above attains values from the interval 0 to 1. The lowest value NGSC=0 would mean the brain-wide BOLD signal consisted of exactly one principal component or spatial mode, and there is maximum global functional connectivity between all vertices. The highest value NGSC=1 would mean the total data variance is uniformly distributed across all m principal components, and a maximum spatial complexity or a lowest functional connectivity is found. To assess if persistent effects of psychedelics, we compared network changes 1–21 days post-psilocybin to pre-drug baseline. The network change analysis (described above) indicated that connectivity at the ‘whole brain’ level did not change following psilocybin (Fig. S2 and S3). A screen was conducted with p>0.05 threshold to identify brain systems or areas showing persisting effects. This analysis identified the anterior hippocampus as a candidate region of interest (ROI) for persisting FC change (see ‘Pre/Post Psilocybin Network Change Analysis’ in Extended Data). We assessed anterior hippocampus FC globally with cortex and specifically with the DMN. A bilateral anterior hippocampus ROI was used to generate a cortex-wide FC seed map for every session. Root-mean-square FC was computer to generate global FC67. Global FC was compared between pre-psilocybin sessions and post-psilocybin using a linear mixed effects model described above (drug condition and task were fixed effects, and Subject ID, MRI session, and head motion were random effects). Post-hoc visualization and timecourses were generated for FC with individual-defined default mode network. Raw fMRI and structural data from (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012) and (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) were run through our in-house registration and processing pipeline described above. These datasets were used for replication, external validation, and generalization to another classic psychedelic (i.e., LSD) for the measures described above (e.g., normalized global spatial complexity, and the MDS-derived psilocybin FC dimension (Dimension 1). Carhart-Harris et al., 2012: N=15 healthy adults completed two scanning sessions (psilocybin and saline) which included eyes-closed resting state BOLD scan for 6 minutes prior to and following I.V. infusion of drug. fMRI data were acquired using a gradient- echo EPI sequence, TR/TE 3000/35 ms, field-of-view = 192 mm, 64 × 64 acquisition matrix, parallel acceleration factor = 2, 90° flip angle. Carhart-Harris et al., 2016: N=22 healthy adults completed two scanning sessions (LSD and saline), which included eyes-closed resting state BOLD scan acquired for 22 minutes following I.V. drug infusion lasting 12 min. fMRI data were acquired using a gradient echo planer imaging sequence, TR/TE = 2000/35ms, field-of-view = 220mm, 64 × 64 acquisition matrix, parallel acceleration factor = 2, 90° flip angle, 3.4mm isotropic voxels.

"""Less than 100 million people worldwide are now estimated to have underweight conditions.""","Malnutrition         Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition addresses 3 broad groups of conditions: There are 4 broad sub-forms of undernutrition: wasting, stunting, underweight, and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals. Undernutrition makes children in particular much more vulnerable to disease and death. Low weight-for-height is known as wasting. It usually indicates recent and severe weight loss because a person has not had enough food to eat and/or they have had an infectious disease, such as diarrhoea, which has caused them to lose weight. A young child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Low height-for-age is known as stunting. It is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition, usually associated with poor socioeconomic conditions, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness, and/or inappropriate infant and young child feeding and care in early life. Stunting holds children back from reaching their physical and cognitive potential. Children with low weight-for-age are known as underweight. A child who is underweight may be stunted, wasted or both. Inadequacies in intake of vitamins and minerals often referred to as micronutrients, can also be grouped together. Micronutrients enable the body to produce enzymes, hormones and other substances that are essential for proper growth and development. Iodine, vitamin A, and iron are the most important in global public health terms; their deficiency represents a major threat to the health and development of populations worldwide, particularly children and pregnant women in low-income countries. Overweight and obesity is when a person is too heavy for his or her height. Abnormal or excessive fat accumulation can impair health. Body mass index (BMI) is an index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify overweight and obesity. It is defined as a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m²). In adults, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, whereas obesity is a BMI of 30 or more. Among children and adolescents, BMI thresholds for overweight and obesity vary by age. Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance between energy consumed (too much) and energy expended (too little). Globally, people are consuming foods and drinks that are more energy-dense (high in sugars and fats) and engaging in less physical activity. Diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) include cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke, and often linked with high blood pressure), certain cancers, and diabetes. Unhealthy diets and poor nutrition are among the top risk factors for these diseases globally. In 2022, approximately 390 million adults aged 18 years and older worldwide were underweight, while 2.5 billion were overweight, including 890 million who were living with obesity. Among children and adolescents aged 5-19 years, 390 million were overweight, including 160 million who were living with obesity. Another 190 million were living with thinness (BMI-for-age more than two standard deviations below the reference median). In 2022, an estimated 149 million children under the age of 5 years were suffering from stunting, while 37 million were living with overweight or obesity. Nearly half of deaths among children under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries. Every country in the world is affected by one or more forms of malnutrition. Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges. Women, infants, children, and adolescents are at particular risk of malnutrition. Optimizing nutrition early in life –including the 1000 days from conception to a child’s second birthday – ensures the best possible start in life, with long-term benefits. Poverty amplifies the risk of, and risks from, malnutrition. People who are poor are more likely to be affected by different forms of malnutrition. Also, malnutrition increases health care costs, reduces productivity, and slows economic growth, which can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and ill-health. On 1 April 2016, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly proclaimed 2016–2025 the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition. The Decade is an unprecedented opportunity for addressing all forms of malnutrition. It sets a concrete timeline for implementation of the commitments made at the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) to meet a set of global nutrition targets and diet-related NCD targets by 2025, as well as relevant targets in the Agenda for Sustainable Development by 2030 – in particular, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture) and SDG 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages). Led by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition calls for policy action across 6 key areas: WHO aims for a world free of all forms of malnutrition, where all people achieve health and wellbeing. According to the 2016–2025 nutrition strategy, WHO works with Member States and partners towards universal access to effective nutrition interventions and to healthy diets from sustainable and resilient food systems. WHO uses its convening power to help set, align and advocate for priorities and policies that move nutrition forward globally; develops evidence-informed guidance based on robust scientific and ethical frameworks; supports the adoption of guidance and implementation of effective nutrition actions; and monitors and evaluates policy and programme implementation and nutrition outcomes. This work is framed by the Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant, and young child nutrition, adopted by Member States through a World Health Assembly resolution in 2012. Actions to end malnutrition are also vital for achieving the diet-related targets of the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, the Global strategy for women’s, children’s, and adolescent’s health 2016–2030, and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development.

"""Deblina Sarkar is constructing gigantic robots to exit our minds""","Deblina Sarkar is building microscopic machines to enter our brains  Every print subscription comes with full digital access She dreams of using the ultratiny devices to cure brain diseases Deblina Sarkar wants to develop miniature machines that may one day help treat Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological afflictions. JIMMY DAY, MIT MEDIA LAB By Nikk Ogasa MAY 23, 2023 AT 8:00 AM Deblina Sarkar makes little machines, for which she has big dreams. The machines are so little, in fact, that they can humbly inhabit living cells. And her dreams are so big, they may one day save your mind. Sarkar is a nanotechnologist and assistant professor at MIT. She develops ultratiny electronic devices, some smaller than a mote of dust, that she hopes will one day enter the brain. She’s also a fan of Kung Fu movies and likes to dance her own twist on bharata natyam, a classical Indian dance form. Occasionally she goes hiking with her graduate students, once taking them as far as Yellowstone. Building camaraderie is vital, Sarkar says. But “I’m probably working day and night on my research,” she confesses. “There is an urgent problem at hand.” That problem is Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological afflictions that assault the minds of millions of people worldwide. Sarkar’s solution: Employ minute machines to detect and reverse these disorders. “She was always interested in applying … electronics to biological systems,” says collaborator and bioengineering researcher Samir Mitragotri of Harvard University, who has known Sarkar for about a decade and was on her thesis committee. She envisions using her tools to “transform how people are conducting biology,” he says, “bridging the worlds.” Born in Kolkata, India, Sarkar credits both of her parents as early inspirations. Her boldness as a researcher comes from her mother, who as a young woman defied social norms in her village by working to fund her own education and speaking out against the dowry system. Meanwhile, Sarkar’s father sparked her fascination for engineering. At the age of 15, he abandoned his dreams of becoming an engineer to find other jobs; he needed to support his parents and the rest of his family after his father, an Indian freedom fighter, was shot in the leg and could no longer work. Still, Sarkar recalls her father finding time for his passion, fashioning devices to make home life more convenient. These included an electricity-free washing machine and vehicles that could freight hefty loads down local byroads to their house. “That got me very, very interested in science and technology,” Sarkar says. “Engineering specifically.” After earning a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Dhanbad, Sarkar moved to California to study nanoelectronics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. There, she tested new ways to create nanodevices that could reduce the amount of power consumed by computers and other everyday electronics. One standout device Sarkar developed during her graduate work was a transistor that reduced the amount of power lost as heat by 90 percent compared with some of today’s most common silicon transistors (SN: 3/18/22). For the breakthrough, UC Santa Barbara awarded Sarkar’s Ph.D. dissertation the Lancaster Award for its impact in advancing math, physical sciences and engineering. Along the way, Sarkar became fascinated with the brain, which she calls “the lowest energy computer.” A project imaging amyloid-beta plaques as a postdoc at MIT opened the door to fusing her dual interests, and she stayed on as an assistant professor to found the Nano-Cybernetic Biotrek group. Her group develops nanodevices that can interface with living cells, and “neuromorphic” computing devices, which have architectures inspired by the human brain and nervous system.   So far, the group’s most innovative device may be the Cell Rover, a flat antenna that could monitor processes inside cells. For a study reported in 2022, Sarkar and her colleagues used magnetic fields to finesse a Cell Rover, roughly the size of a tardigrade, into a mature frog egg cell. The team demonstrated that when stimulated by a magnetic field created by an alternating current, molecules in the nanodevice vibrated at frequencies safe for living cells. Using a wire coil receiver, the researchers were able to detect how those vibrations affected the device’s own magnetic field, thus showing it could communicate with the outside world. Cell Rovers could be outfitted with films that latch onto and detect select proteins or other biomolecules. Sarkar envisions using the device to spot misfolded proteins in the brain that may be early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Today, memory loss is the only way to know a living person has Alzheimer’s, but by then, the damage is irreversible, Sarkar says. Cell Rovers could also be paired with nanodevices that harvest energy from and electrically stimulate cells, opening the door for new types of brain electrodes and subcellular pacemakers. Or fleets of remotely controlled devices could replace invasive surgeries — detecting a small tumor growing in the brain, for example, and maybe even killing it. She’s essentially establishing a new field of science, at the intersection of nanoelectronics and biology, Mitragotri says. “There are many opportunities for the future.” One day, Sarkar hopes to insert nanodevices between human neurons to boost the computing speed of the fleshy processor already in our skulls. Our brains are remarkable, she says, but “we could be better than what we are.” Deblina Sarkar is one of this year’s SN 10: Scientists to Watch, our list of 10 early and mid-career scientists who are making extraordinary contributions to their field.

As the sole selector of both the squad and the playing XI, Conrad has made the decision to give Stubbs a ""good run"" in the position despite his inexperience, because he sees something special in him. ""Technique is obviously a big factor because you're going to be facing the new ball the bulk of the time,"" Conrad said from Trinidad, where South Africa will play West Indies in the first of their two Tests from Wednesday. ""And he's quite an imposing character, a big, strong, strapping boy, and I quite like that. I like the fact that at the top of the order, there are quite imposing guys; guys that have got a good aura about them and strong body language."" South Africa's top three for this series will be: Aiden Markram, who stands at 1.85 metres, is an Under-19 World Cup-winning captain and the only national men's captain to qualify for a senior World Cup final; Tony de Zorzi, a bubbly character who is not afraid to speak his mind, especially on social media; and Stubbs, who is 1.84 metres tall and broad-shouldered. Similarly placed West Indies and South Africa meet amid hopes of competitiveness Tristan Stubbs - superb against spin, destructive at the death Imraan Khan named new batting lead at Cricket South Africa Conrad didn't elaborate on what the advantage of three physically big players would be, but it may have something to do with who they are being followed by: their diminutive captain Temba Bavuma, who is 1.62 metres tall and has not batted in a Test match since March last year. Bavuma was forced to withdraw from the Boxing Day Test against India with a left hamstring injury, a month after he suffered a right hamstring injury at the ODI World Cup. He is fully rehabilitated after a lengthy off-season and last week said he was ready to take on the responsibility of the No. 4 spot, as South Africa's most experienced batter and one of only three squad members (Kagiso Rabada and Keshav Maharaj are the others) with more than 50 Test caps. That doesn't mean Bavuma needs protecting, but that he needs players who can bat around him and lay a foundation. And Stubbs has been identified as someone who can do that. ""His psyche and his technique speak to someone who will do that job really well,"" Conrad said. ""We've got a good one for the future of South African cricket."" The numbers suggest Conrad is on to something. Stubbs has played 18 first-class matches over his career and has an eye-catching average of 50.20. His most notable long-format innings was the 302* he scored against (now-relegated) Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN) Inland in Pietermaritzburg last February. Although the opposition was the weakest in South Africa's top tier, Stubbs scored his runs quickly, off 372 balls, to demonstrate his dominance. His first red-ball hundred also came against KZN Inland, in February 2020, in the second tier of South Africa's domestic system. Stubbs was playing for Eastern Province (EP) and batting at No. 7 when he hit a 232-ball 105 to take EP from 135 for 5 to 327 for 8, and give them a first-innings lead. He has three more centuries in the format, the most high profile being 117 for South Africa A against Sri Lanka A in Colombo last year, when Conrad first decided to try him up the order. It was on that tour that Stubbs was identified as a possible long-term pick for the No. 3 spot and Conrad has all but committed to giving him the rest of this World Test Championship cycle to see if he can make the spot his own. ""I'm going to give him a good run,"" Conrad said, ""I'd be surprised if we didn't back him throughout the rest of the cycle. I'm pretty confident Tristan is going to come good."" South Africa play eight more Tests in this cycle - two in the West Indies, two in Bangladesh and two at home against each of Sri Lanka and Pakistan - which will give Stubbs a variety of oppositions and conditions to adjust to. He has received no special instructions or expectations from Conrad other than to express himself in the way he feels most comfortable and believes that the results will come. ""We do who we are,"" Conrad said. ""It's become quite a cliche now being the best version of yourself, but…"" But that's the mantra Conrad is adopting, albeit not in catch phrases. ""Whatever that identity is, you couple that with the conditions that you're confronting and then marry that with what the skills the opposition bring, but ultimately, you still operate with your own identity in mind. That's the only messaging I've given Tristan and the rest of the batters."" Firdose Moonda is ESPNcricinfo's correspondent for South Africa and women's cricket","1.

"""Justin Simien celebrates Lando spinoff series continuation: 'I am in joy'""","Star Wars Project ‘Lando’ Not Moving Forward, Says Director Justin Simien  By Bruce Haring  Justin Simien says the Donald Glover-starring Solo: A Star Wars Story spinoff series Lando will not be happening. Collider published remarks Friday from Simien indicating that Lando is dead. Simien is out promoting Hollywood Black, an MGM+ docuseries based on the book by scholar Donald Bogle examining race and representation in Hollywood. That’s when the Lando project came up. “It was pretty developed,” he said. “There was a Bible. There was concept art. There were scripts. But it just wasn’t meant to be.”  He added that he grieved for the project.  “For me, it has to be done pretty straight on. Like, ‘I am in grief. I do not feel good.’ I have to let myself feel those feelings,” he said. “There’s so much that I experience that I get to keep forever and take into the next project. I can’t obviously take the storyline or the IP or the characters, but there’s so much more that I got, as a maker, and that’s mine. Sorry, it’s too late, you can’t take that part back.”  Lando was first announced in 2020. Glover’s Lando was the breakout star of Solo, and Simien had three seasons of Dear White People, the series he created, directed, and wrote for Netflix. It all seemed ready to pop. Why Lando fell through the cracks at Disney+ is still unclear. But Simien has plenty on his plate. Simien has a live-action Star Trek comedy series starring Tawny Newsome on the way, announced at San Diego Comic-Con. The logline: “Federation outsiders serving a gleaming resort planet find out their day-to-day exploits are being broadcast to the entire quadrant.” “I literally grew up watching that show and wishing I could go to space,” Simien told Collider about the Star Trek project. I’m living that childhood dream right now.” Hollywood Black will premiere on August 11 on MGM+. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Correction: his VERSION of the project will not be moving forward. We’ll still be getting a Lando project with Donald Glover. Too bad. I would have liked a Lando series, especially if they’d have had Billy Dee Williams involved as a narrator. However, I’m not surprised by the decision. Donald Glover’s plate seems really full right now. Has it been confirmed that Newsome will be “starring” in the Star Trek sitcom? I’ve only read references to her being a writer and executive producer. Let’s be clear, Glover was not the breakout star of “Solo”. Shutting this project down is the best thing that can happen after the disaster of “The Acolyte”. Someone will come along to revive the show. By hook or by crook, it’ll get done. It may take a while, but it’ll happen. Signup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

 Elizabeth Taylor and Faye Dunaway Ruined Star Power As A Craft,"Elizabeth Taylor and Faye Dunaway Made Star Power Into an Art — These HBO Docs Prove It   By Daniel D'Addario  There’s something that unites the recent documentaries “Faye” and “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes.” It isn’t just that both played on HBO — “Faye” launched in July, while “Elizabeth Taylor” is to premiere August 3 — or that both center the stories of legendary, Oscar-winning performers. Faye is, of course, Faye Dunaway, of “Network” and “Chinatown,” while Elizabeth Taylor, one of the most decadently media-hounded figures of the 20th Century, practically needs no introduction at all.  What the films share, though, is a poignant and sometimes painful double yearning. In the documentaries, Dunaway — still with us at age 83, and interviewed recently for this film — and Taylor — who died in 2011 but whose “lost tapes” catalogue an extensive 1964 debriefing with journalist Richard Meryman —  both express doubt, anxiety and even shame for career missteps, misbegotten projects and the ways in which their private troubles played out in public view. The viewer feels for them, first because they are human, and then because their manner of expressing their emotions is so extravagantly more than human. That’s the other yearning at the heart of these documentaries: a sense that the culture can no longer produce great actresses who are, too, stars who glitter quite this brightly.  Both films, happily, are stuffed full of film clips, and both give a sense of their respective subjects’ styles. In director Laurent Bouzereau’s curation in “Faye,” Dunaway, at her best, uses a bracing sense of control in order to shock the viewer all the more when she snaps in grand fashion. (The famous photograph of her the morning after winning her Oscar — used as the featured image in this column — in which she’s gazing into the middle distance, is a supreme example of her powers: We’re seeing, through exhaustion and exhilaration, a woman in utter control of the image she wants to present.) In interviews with the press, Dunaway, while seeming to hold her feelings back, has a relentless erudition and quickness that makes clear just how much of herself was in “Network’s” brilliant executive, or “Chinatown’s” tricky femme fatale. Her interview for the documentary feels like a sort of letting-go, an unburdening of thoughts she might have withheld from the press to this point. But the clarity of thought remains intact.   Meanwhile, filmmaker Nanette Burstein shows Taylor, for all the outsizedness of her fame, carrying herself on screen with a funny self-deprecation, a shrewdness that feels decades ahead of her time. We’re told that Taylor was 32 when she played the fiftysomething Martha in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” and while her physical transformation for the role is indeed impressive, it’s the changes to her soul and bearing — her willingness to flaunt her signs of age in a sort of ironic self-deprecation — that feels most remarkable. And both actors are startingly open about career and personal setbacks they faced, including the public’s coming to pigeonhole them. Dunaway speaks about her bipolar diagnosis and her struggles with alcohol, both things that derailed her ability to trust her great gift, her clear and precise thinking. (Both, also, led to her outsized reputation as a difficult colleague — her composure giving way to a great break isn’t just something that happened for Dunaway onscreen.) And we also get an unpacking of why “Mommie Dearest” — the infamous bomb that toppled her career — was such a severe disappointment. Dunaway believed she was really finding something sharp and true in her depiction of Joan Crawford as an abusive mother, and lost herself in the role so deeply that she couldn’t find her way, in the absence of a surer directorial hand, to coherence. Others who speak in “Faye,” including her son, are better-situated than is Dunaway to judge why it is that she takes a particular project’s failure so hard. Publicity-shy even despite her doing a sweeping interview toward the end of her life, Dunaway poured her personal setbacks and challenges into her work. To reject it, perhaps, is to reject her. Meanwhile, Taylor speaks with sharp frankness about, for instance, her dislike of the film “Butterfield 8” (for which she won her first Oscar, which Taylor credits to sympathy for health struggles she was undergoing) and the dramas of filming “Cleopatra,” which she shot with Richard Burton, one of the loves of her life. Taylor and Burton — two stars of exaggerated appetites, talents and passions — strode atop the world. But their notoriety came with its own frustrations for someone who’d wanted, first, to tell stories: “It’s a losing game!,” Taylor tells Meryman. “People already have a set image. They want to believe either the good or the bad. And if you try and explain, then you lose yourself along the way.”  And we see Taylor’s performance of herself as someone increasingly willing to display her frustration with the press. Asked, at a joint press conference with Burton, about her relationship with ex-husband Eddie Fisher, Taylor snaps “Do you read the papers, love? I suggest you do,” then rolls her eyes and tosses her head back. Later, she tells a journalist from “60 Minutes” that “fighting is one of the greatest exercises in marital togetherness”; when the journalist asks if Burton dominates her in their marriage, she widens those famous eyes and blurts “You must be joking!” That it seems almost like an impulse, rather than the ongoing press approach of someone eager to communicate her weariness with the press’ rapaciousness, is a sign of just how gifted an actress Taylor was.  “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes” constructs, methodically, a case for Taylor as a genius both of performing onscreen and at performing for a sort of media that no longer exists. Both Dunaway, an actress who made a point of revealing as little as possible, and Taylor, one who was willing to give it all away — but with a wink that made the consumer aware that she saw herself being consumed — existed in a media climate both rougher and more predictable than today’s.  That media climate was cruel and heartbreaking to those who became its subjects; it also made legends. No one, likely, would trade today’s way of writing about actresses, for all its flaws, for the way Dunaway and Taylor were written about. And yet other aspects of the culture were better-situated to create legends. Dunaway, reflecting, begins to see, in the work she made, an impact on the world; Taylor leveraged her fame not merely for movieland success but for charitable pursuits astounding in their magnitude and timeliness. (In an exceptional clip in the Taylor documentary, Taylor explains why she began fundraising for the fight against AIDS: Few were speaking out or doing anything, and, she says, “it so angered me that I thought, ‘Bitch, do something yourself!’”) We don’t make stars the way we did in Dunaway and Taylor’s era these days. And that’s a good thing. But, for all the ascendant actors who compel in their own ways, watching these women, in two very strong entries in the celebrity-tells-all canon, can convince a viewer, for a moment, that we don’t, anymore, make them at all. “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes” premieres on HBO and Max on Aug. 3; “Faye” is streaming on Max.

Rahul Gandhi to retain Wayanad Lok Sabha seat,"Wayanad prepares for by-poll after Rahul Gandhi vacates    Updated - June 17, 2024 09:20 pm IST Published - June 17, 2024 09:07 pm IST - KALPETTA Congress leaders and brother-sister duo Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra share a hug after the announcement of Priyanka’s candidature from the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, in New Delhi on June 17, 2024.   Photo Credit: ANI Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency is preparing for a by-poll after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi decided to retain Rae Bareli. Though Mr Gandhi had expressed his anguish regarding which constituency he should abandon — Wayanad or Rae Bareli- during his recent visit in Wayanad, finally he decided to vacate Wayanad. Mr. Gandhi had won both Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh and Wayanad in the recent Lok Sabha polls. A meeting of senior leaders of the Congress part, on June 17, at Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge’s house in Delhi decided to leave the Wayanad constituency and retain Rai Beariely. It also decided to nominate his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from Wayanad. Mr. Gandhi had scripted a huge victory in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency for the second time with a margin of 3,64,422 votes over his nearest rival Annie Raja of the Communist Party of India. While Mr. Gandhi polled 6,47,445 votes, Annie Raja received 2,83,023 votes. BJP candidate K. Surendran stood in third position with 1,41,045 votes. Mr Gandhi had won the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Wayanad with a record majority of 4,31,770 votes. Now all eyes are on Ms. Priyanka Gandhi to see if she could repeat the astonishing majority scripted by Mr. Gandhi in Wayanad and who would be the LDF and NDA candidates against her. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Gandhi secured a majority of 64.8% votes while CPI’s P.P. Suneer came second with 25.2% votes. Mr. Gandhi’s performance as the MP, and the national leader of a major party won the people’s favour for the second time. Ms. Annie Raja, a national leader of the CPI, showcased good performance and carried out an intensive campaign. However, her efforts did not come to fruition. BJP State President K. Surendran was the third major contender whose campaign failed to bring about positive results, though the vote share of BJP increased considerably. Mr. Gandhi won the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh by a margin of 3,90,030 votes, bettering his mother Sonia Gandhi’s victory margin in 2019. The Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency has supported the Congress party since its inception in 2009. Earlier IUML State president Panakkad Sadiqali Shihab Thangal and IUML national General Secretary P.K. Kunhalikkutty had urged the Congress leaders to consider Ms. Gandhi for the Wayanad seat if Mr. Gandhi would leave it. They said such a move would strengthen the UDF in the State.

"""In the seven days after President Biden stepped down as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Harris campaign received a mere $20 million.""","Harris Campaign Says It Raised $310 Million in July, More Than Double Trump’s Haul   ADVERTISEMENT In the seven days after President Biden stepped down as the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Harris campaign raked in $200 million. By Theodore Schleifer Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign survived a brutal few weeks of fund-raising in July to bounce back so dramatically before the end of the month that she more than doubled the amount of money raised by former President Donald J. Trump, her campaign announced on Friday. The Harris campaign, which for the first 20 days of July was the Biden campaign, said it had raised $310 million during the month, including $200 million in just seven days after President Biden dropped out of the race. The Trump campaign and its own allies said on Thursday that they had collected $139 million in July, an enormous sum but well short of what the Harris campaign said it had brought in amid a huge burst of enthusiasm about her candidacy. The Harris campaign raised almost as much in July as the Biden campaign had raised in March, April, May and June combined. The surge in fund-raising has allowed Democrats, for the first time in months, to have a cash-on-hand advantage over Republicans. The Harris campaign said it now had $377 million in its war chest, in contrast to the $327 million that the Trump campaign has said it has. ADVERTISEMENT Neither campaign disclosed precisely how much of the money was raised or held by the campaigns themselves versus their allied party committees. Democrats’ fund-raising was said to have plummeted in the first three weeks of the month, in the aftermath of Mr. Biden’s disastrous debate, although precise figures were not known or released by the Biden campaign. But after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, the fund-raising spigot was opened wide. The $200 million that the Harris campaign said it had raised in the week after Mr. Biden ended his re-election bid was more than Mr. Biden’s haul in the first three months of the year. The Trump campaign’s own fund-raising was strong — and most likely would have far outstripped the Democrats’ had the party not changed its standard-bearer. The $139 million raised in July amounted to one of the Trump team’s strongest fund-raising months to date, just off the sum raised in May, when Mr. Trump’s supporters responded to his felony conviction with $141 million in donations. After collecting $112 million in June, donations for the Trump team ticked up in July as Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt, was formally nominated at the Republican convention in Milwaukee and picked Senator JD Vance of Ohio to be his running mate — events that surely motivated his donors and supporters. July was the second straight month in which Democrats out-raised the Trump team. In June, when Mr. Biden was still atop the ticket, his campaign raised $127 million and ended the month with $240 million on hand, all before the history-making events that would unfold over the next four weeks.

" The son of the prosecutor in Donald J. Trump’s Manhattan civil case has consulted for Republican candidates, with his connection to the president remaining ambiguous.","Prosecution of Donald Trump in New York    The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump is a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels to ensure her silence about a sexual encounter between them; with costs related to the transaction included, the payments totaled $420,000. The Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Alvin Bragg, accused Trump of falsifying these business records with the intent to commit other crimes: violation of federal campaign finance limits, unlawfully influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and tax fraud.[a] The indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was approved by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30, 2023. On April 3, Trump traveled from his residence in Florida to New York City, where he surrendered to the Manhattan DA's office and was arraigned the next day. Trump pleaded not guilty and stated that he would continue to campaign for the 2024 presidential election, even if convicted. The trial began on April 15, 2024. On April 30, Trump also became the first U.S. president to be held in criminal contempt of court, due to comments he made earlier in the month about individuals involved with the trial. The prosecution argued that Trump's 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush money to Daniels through Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. The prosecution rested on May 20, 2024, after calling 20 witnesses. The defense argued that Trump was unaware of any allegedly unlawful scheme, that Cohen was unreliable as a witness, and that the retainer agreement between them was valid. The defense rested on May 21 after calling two witnesses. Throughout proceedings, the defense also made unsuccessful requests for the case to be delayed or dismissed, for the judge to recuse himself, and for a mistrial. Trump was convicted on all counts on May 30, 2024, becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Sentencing is scheduled for September 18. Trump has said that he will appeal the ruling. In July 2006, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known professionally as ""Stormy Daniels"", met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. At the time, Trump was the host of the reality TV series The Apprentice and was married to Melania Trump.[4] According to Daniels, Trump invited her to his penthouse at Harrah's Lake Tahoe[5] where the two had sex and talked about making her a guest on The Apprentice.[6][7] In 2011, Daniels considered selling the story to the celebrity magazine Life & Style for US$15,000 as Trump began exploring a potential presidential bid. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue Life & Style when it asked the Trump Organization for comment. Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, leaked the story to the gossip blog The Dirty in October. The post was taken down following complaints by Trump's lawyers, and Daniels disputed the story's veracity.[8] Cohen acknowledged during court testimony in May 2024 that he advised for the story's removal.[9] As Trump's 2016 presidential campaign began, Rodriguez approached multiple publications—including the National Enquirer—and attempted to sell the story. Following the publication of a controversial recording of Trump and Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, the National Enquirer sought to suppress the story. Rather than paying Daniels, the National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard negotiated a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement between Daniels and Michael Cohen. Cohen attempted to find the money as the election neared and repeatedly delayed her payment. Keith Davidson, Daniels' lawyer, canceled the deal in October 2016.[5][8] Ultimately, Cohen drew the money from his home equity line of credit and sent it through a shell company incorporated in Delaware.[5][8] Trump initially denied knowing about the check made out to Daniels. In April 2018, aboard Air Force One, he told a reporter he did not know where Cohen got the money.[10] Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post described this statement as a lie,[11] as Trump had personally reimbursed Cohen for the payment.[12][11][13] Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, also refuted Trump's claims in a Fox News interview, saying that Trump was aware of the payments.[14] Trump wrote several checks totaling $420,000 to Cohen. The checks reimbursed him for the non-disclosure agreement and covered the costs for Cohen to manipulate online polls to boost Trump's status. The $180,000 paid to Cohen was doubled to offset taxes, and $60,000 was added. These payments were made throughout 2017, during Trump's first year of presidency.[15] The payments made to Cohen were declared as a legal expense.[16] Nine monthly checks from Trump to Cohen, dated April to December 2017, exist as evidence.[17] In January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported on Cohen's payment to Daniels.[18] Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts relating to the payment—as well as another payment made to Karen McDougal—in August. In his admission of guilt, Cohen stated that he acted ""at the direction of a candidate for federal office"", implicating Trump.[19][20] In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.[21] On May 2, 2024, The Daily Beast broke a story that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg had assisted the 2016 campaign with its finance reports.[22] Following Cohen's August 2018 admission of guilt, Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation against the Trump Organization and two of its executives.[23] The office paused its inquiry when the office of the federal U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York began a separate investigation into the payments,[24] but the federal inquiry concluded without charges in July 2019.[25] [b] The Manhattan DA's office then issued a subpoena for the Trump Organization in August, seeking documents relating to the payments.[27] Additionally, the office subpoenaed accounting firm Mazars USA, demanding eight years of Trump's corporate tax returns.[28] Trump's lawyers sued Vance to block the subpoena, citing Trump's immunity from criminal inquiries as the president of the United States.[29] In Trump v. Vance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Vance, allowing the subpoena to continue.[30] Following the 2021 New York County District Attorney election, Alvin Bragg succeeded Vance as the Manhattan DA.[31] In early 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a Manhattan prosecutor, sought to revive the case under the theory that if Daniels had extorted Trump, the money would be criminal proceeds, and efforts to conceal its source would constitute money laundering.[32] On further examination, Pomerantz found that the money laundering statute would not apply, and colleagues were skeptical that the hush money would qualify as extortion.[32] With no path to felony charges, Pomerantz abandoned the inquiry and subsequently resigned in February 2022.[32] In January 2023, the Manhattan DA's office impaneled a grand jury, and began presenting evidence of Trump's role in the Stormy Daniels payment.[33] Cohen met extensively with the DA's office and the grand jury,[34][35][36] and by March 3, Cohen had met with the DA's office 18 times[37][38][39] and had given his cellphones to the DA's prosecutors, who wanted evidence of communications including voice recordings of Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.[40] Several other witnesses met with the DA's office or the grand jury in March 2023, including Kellyanne Conway,[41] Hope Hicks, two Trump Organization employees, two former National Enquirer executives who helped broker the hush-money deal, a lawyer for Daniels,[42][43] Daniels herself,[44] Trump-aligned lawyer Robert Costello (who provided testimony, including emails, in which he attempted to discredit Cohen's reliability),[45][46] and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.[47][48][c] As early as that February, prosecutors confirmed that they might leverage additional charges, including insurance fraud, against Allen Weisselberg to pressure him to testify against Trump,[51] and in May, The New York Times reported that they were considering perjury charges against him.[52] In March 2023, District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office indicated that an indictment was likely.[53] By March 9, 2023, prosecutors had offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury the following week, indicating that they were likely preparing to indict him.[54][55] Around that time, Trump and his spokesperson began referring to both Daniels' allegation and the DA's proceedings as ""extortion"".[56] On March 10, 2023, Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopina asked New York City's Department of Investigation to review the criminal probe, asserting its ""weaponization"".[57] On March 13, Tacopina announced that Trump would not testify.[58] Early the next morning, The Guardian reported that Trump's lawyers had argued to the DA that Trump should not be indicted on the basis that the payment did not draw from campaign funds and would have been made regardless of his candidacy.[59] In late March 2023, there was reporting around Daniels having reportedly unsuccessfully communicated in 2018 with Tacopina about possibly representing her in the scandal, for which the DA could move to disqualify the lawyer due to attorney–client privilege and because she reputedly disclosed confidential information to his firm.[60][61][62][63] Additionally, it reemerged that, in 2018, Tacopina had called the hush-money payment ""an illegal agreement"", ""a fraud"", and ""a potential campaign finance issue"".[60] On March 18, 2023, Trump claimed on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that he was to be arrested on March 21[d][e] and that the proceedings were disinformation backed by President Joe Biden, calling for protests in anticipation of a possible indictment.[66][67][68][69][70] Law enforcement and security agencies prepared for potential reactions to an indictment of Trump that week, especially in the areas of the Manhattan Criminal Court and Trump Tower, including by monitoring online threats.[69][71][72][f] New York City Police began to increase security in preparation for the expected indictment on March 21, and a second time for the second expected indictment on March 30.[74] Metal barriers were set up around Trump Tower and the district Criminal Court Building.[75] On March 24, Trump, citing his presidential prospects, insinuated that ""potential death & destruction"" could result from Bragg's allegedly false charge.[76][g] Trump has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"", claiming political persecution.[81] Trump proponents have referred to the case as harassment, calling it a ""political hack job"".[82] The trial and accompanying political theatrics have been described as a ""circus"" by the media.[83][84][85] Due to multiple investigation revivals, the case earned the moniker of ""zombie case"".[32][86] The Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not have any rules blocking presidential candidates with criminal records.[87] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier in Trump v. Anderson that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking the prohibition in section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which states ""no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US"".[88] The Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on March 30, 2023.[89] The indictment was filed with the New York Supreme Court (the ordinary trial court for felonies in the state of New York and not the final court of appeal for the state) the same day.[90] The charges were under seal until published when Trump was arraigned.[91][92] The indictment charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §175.10.[93][94] Each count is related to a specific business document, each having a date ranging from February 14 through December 5, 2017:[95] The allegedly falsified documents are related to Trump's payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money. The payments were listed in the business records as a legal expense payable to Michael Cohen, whereas the indictment alleges that they were actually to reimburse Cohen for the earlier, allegedly illicit, payment to Daniels.[96][97] Falsifying business records in the first degree is a felony under New York state law that requires that the ""intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof"". This is in contrast to falsifying business records in the second degree, which is a misdemeanor that does not have that requirement.[95][96][97] The charges neither include, nor even identify, the additional crimes, constituting a relatively unusual strategy for the DA:[98][95] A New York Times analysis of about 30 false business records cases brought by Mr. Bragg and his predecessor — based on court records, interviews and information the office provided — shows that in this respect, the case against Mr. Trump stands apart. In all but two of the indictments reviewed by The Times, the defendant was charged with an additional crime on top of the false records charge. In later filings, Bragg listed (but still did not charge) three general types of crime that Trump allegedly intended to commit: violation of federal campaign finance limits, violation of state election laws by unlawfully influencing the 2016 election, and violation of state tax laws regarding the reimbursement.[99] Trump could have moved to allow the jury to convict on the misdemeanor charges as a lesser included offense, but he did not.[100][101] Each count for which Trump was convicted could result in a prison sentence of up to four years, to be served consecutively, with a maximum sentence of 20 years.[102][95][103][104] The judge may also choose to impose no prison sentence.[105] The conviction does not legally prohibit Trump from continuing his campaign in the 2024 presidential election, nor is he forbidden to assume the presidency should he win, even if he were in prison.[106] Trump stated in an April 2023 Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson that he would not drop his candidacy if convicted.[107][108] Trump was arraigned on April 4, 2023. A law enforcement source told Reuters that police would close streets around the courthouse in advance of Trump's expected appearance.[109] On April 3, Trump flew from Palm Beach International Airport into LaGuardia Airport on his private plane, and took his motorcade to Trump Tower, where he stayed the night.[110][111] Todd Blanche, a lawyer who had defended Paul Manafort during his 2016 fraud trial, had recently resigned from his law firm to aid Trump's case.[112] Police increased security in and around Manhattan ahead of the arraignment; authorities said there were no credible threats of violence or organized plans of protests.[111] Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, warned protestors to be peaceful.[113] Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is presiding over the case.[114] Merchan denied a motion filed by media organizations to allow a television broadcast of the arraignment or to allow electronic devices to be used in the courtroom, but allowed five press pool still photographers.[115][116] Courtroom sketch artists also documented the proceedings.[117] The courtroom's glass doors were covered as a security measure.[118] Upon entering the courthouse, he was put in police custody and placed under arrest.[119][120] He was booked and fingerprinted, but he was not handcuffed, nor was a mug shot taken.[121][122] Trump entered the courtroom an hour later,[123] pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges.[124] The indictment was unsealed (publicly released) shortly thereafter, charging Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of a ""conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election"".[125][126] This marked the first indictment of a former U.S. president.[127][128][129] At the arraignment, Merchan warned Trump not to use social media to incite violence.[130] Possible trial dates were discussed; prosecutors proposed January 2024, but Trump's defense team objected, saying that the trial should be set for later in 2024.[131] Immediately after the arraignment, Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago and addressed a crowd of supporters in the evening.[132][110] Trump made several false claims about topics such as his handling of government documents, District Attorney Bragg, and the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.[133] During Trump's arraignment, the court set deadlines for pre-trial proceedings, including for prosecutors to provide discovery to the defense.[131] The court set a deadline of August 8, 2023, for pre-trial motions to be filed.[131] As he had done in other cases, Trump used ""attack-and-delay"" tactics, targeting the prosecutors and the judge while prolonging proceedings, with the aim that the case might continue into late 2024, near the presidential election.[134][135] Trump's lawyers maintained that he was unaware of any allegedly unlawful schemes that his allies or associates may have engaged in.[136] On March 12, 2024, the defense team filed their strategy writing ""President Trump lacked the requisite intent to commit the conduct charged in the Indictment because of his awareness that various lawyers were involved in the underlying conduct giving rise to the charges.""[137] The defense counsel stated that they would not invoke the formal ""advice of counsel"" defense, but that Trump would ""elicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges"".[137][138][h] On September 29, 2023, Trump's team submitted omnibus motions to dismiss the indictment and requesting clarification of the charges.[140] On April 27, Trump's team had asked for the charges to be explained in full.[141] It was possible that the second crime(s) would eventually be specified in a bill of particulars,[142] but according to a governing appeals case from c. 1980 this is not necessary.[143] On May 16, the DA's office argued that it did not need to elaborate further on the basis that Trump already ""has more than sufficient information to prepare his defense"", while reiterating possible secondary charges.[144][145][i] Trump's team was reportedly considering invoking a 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision which emphasizes the importance of specifying punishable criminal charges; additionally, a 1999 decision states that ""any fact ... that increases the maximum penalty for [one] crime must be charged in an indictment ... and proved"".[141] On February 15, 2024, the court denied the motions to dismiss.[146][147][148] However, the court did partially grant Trump's request seeking clarification of the charges. Trump is not only accused of falsifying business records, but doing so with the intention to commit or conceal some other crime. Holding it would be unfair to expect Trump to prepare a defense to a newly raised theory mid-trial, the court limited the prosecution to just three theories of ""other crimes"" that had already been identified during pre-trial procedure.[146][149] As of Trump's arraignment on April 4, 2023, it was expected that the discovery process would take several months.[150] On April 17, 2023, the DA's office requested that Merchan obtain further information from Tacopina, including his firm's correspondence with Daniels, to determine whether their history constituted a conflict of interest.[63] On September 1, Merchan ruled that it did not.[151] On May 4, Merchan heard arguments about the DA office's request to restrict information it turns over to Trump's lawyers from being shared with Trump himself (at least until the trial), citing his past social-media posts attacking Bragg and witnesses. The defense has argued that the government should be equally restrained from discussing information publicly and that Trump should be allowed to defend himself politically.[152][153] On May 8, Merchan ruled in favor of the order, barring evidence from being shared on social media.[154] The judge instructed Trump and his lawyers on their conduct on May 23, informing them that violations could incur a ""wide range of sanctions"" including being held in contempt of court.[155] On May 26, prosecutors stated that they had informed Trump's lawyers that evidence in the hush-money case includes various audio recordings, including one of Trump and a witness. It was unclear if this was in reference to secretly recorded audio from September 2016 which Cohen had previously released.[156][157][158][159] On August 3, federal judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversaw E. Jean Carroll's civil lawsuits against Trump alleging sexual assault and defamation,[j] ruled that Carroll's lawyers could provide video of Trump being deposed to Manhattan prosecutors.[162] On January 15, 2024, Tacopina withdrew from Trump's counsel[163] and Daniels said she expected to testify.[164] Later in the month, the DA was reportedly beginning to meet with witnesses ahead of the trial.[165] On March 18, the judge ruled that both Daniels and Cohen could testify, placing some restrictions on Daniels (as well as Karen McDougal). The defense had requested that the two be blocked from testifying the previous month. Additionally, the judge ruled that Trump's Access Hollywood tape could not be played during the trial but that it could be discussed.[166] On April 22, Merchan ruled on what prosecutors may ask Trump if he testified,[167] following a pretrial Sandoval hearing held on April 19.[168][169][170] On May 10, Judge Juan Merchan suggested that Allen Weisselberg could be called to testify in court after the defense objected to the prosecution's plan to show the jury a $750,000 severance agreement.[171] Neither the defense nor the prosecution had subpoenaed Weisselberg, and there were procedural concerns about adding him to the witness list so late in the trial.[171] Furthermore, Weisselberg's testimony could be in violation of the non-disparagement clause of his severance agreement and he would likely invoke the fifth amendment.[172][173] Justice Juan Merchan, who has experience with financial cases,[174] was randomly assigned to oversee the grand jury proceedings in Trump's case, and continued to oversee handling of the charges approved by the grand jury.[175] On May 31, 2023, Trump's lawyers unsuccessfully filed a motion asking Judge Merchan to disqualify himself because, according to the defense, the judge and his family have supported the Democratic Party, including three $10–15 donations of his to Democratic causes and his daughter's role as a partner and COO of a Democratic consulting firm that serviced Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.[176][177][k] On June 20, the DA's office argued against the recusal request, citing Trump's alleged ""prolific history of baselessly accusing state and federal judges around the country of bias"", saying he seemed to be trying to land a more favorable judge. Prosecutors further argued that there was a lack of hard evidence that a particular trial result would aid Merchan directly or greatly via his daughter's Democratic work,[180] which a state ethics panel had similarly concluded in early May.[181][l] The court denied the motion on August 11, 2023.[185] On April 1, 2024, the defense asked Merchan for permission to file a motion repeating their prior request that he recuse himself for what the defense said was a conflict of interest due to his daughter's Democratic involvement.[186] On April 1, the New York City Bar Association issued a statement of ""unequivocal support"" for Merchan's handling of the recusal concerns.[m] On April 2, prosecutors pointed out that the court and an ethics panel had already found that the political activities of a relative are not grounds for questioning a judge's impartiality.[188][n] The same day, Trump posted a Fox & Friends clip in which co-host Brian Kilmeade criticized the judge's daughter, although Trump highlighted another commentator's statement.[191] As of April 3, Trump had not deleted offending posts made prior to Merchan's expanded order;[192] that night, he linked to a report by far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Merchan's daughter and wife.[193] On April 5, Trump's campaign publicized their motion for Merchan to recuse himself (dated April 3),[188] which asserts numerous counts of bias, and falsely cites the state Office of Court Administration (OCA) as saying Merchan's daughter deleted her X account in April 2023, around when the judge ""solicited an ethics opinion regarding recusal in a letter ... that the Court declined to disclose"".[194][181][195][o][p] On April 6, Trump posted online that if arrested for violating the gag order, he would consider it a ""great honor"" to ""become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela"", the former South African president jailed for anti-apartheid activism.[201] On April 8, Trump's team asked an appeals court to delay the trial and pause the gag order while they appeal the latter; this was denied the following day.[202][203] On April 10, an appeals judge denied another defense delay request which was based on Merchan having not yet ruled on the recusal motion.[204][202] On April 15, Merchan denied the recusal motion.[205] On April 30, an appellate court denied requests for both a recusal and a stay of proceedings.[206] On May 4, 2023, Trump's lawyers asked for the case to be moved to a federal court (though it would remain a state-law prosecution conducted by the Manhattan DA), arguing that it involved alleged conduct somehow ""performed while in office""—despite the potential federal election-law violations not being specified and occurring prior to Trump's inauguration.[153][145][q] As proceedings continued in the New York Supreme Court,[207] Bragg asked for the removal request to be dismissed, arguing that Trump had failed to establish that he was an officer of the United States during his presidency,[208][209] to which the defense expounded its initial argument.[210][153] Even if the case had been moved to federal court, New York state law would have continued to apply.[211] In a hearing on June 27, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein opined that Trump's conduct likely did not constitute presidential activity.[212] On July 19, arguing that the matter was apparently a personal ""cover-up of an embarrassing event"", Hellerstein ruled that the case should remain in state court.[213] Trump appealed the decision on July 28,[214] but withdrew this on November 14.[215] On May 23, 2023, Justice Merchan set the trial for March 25, 2024.[216] Trump's team complained that he expected to have multiple trials around that time. Merchan said he would discuss rescheduling to another time.[217] At a February 15, 2024, hearing, which Trump attended,[218] Merchan reaffirmed the March 25 trial date.[219] In early February 2024, Trump's federal election obstruction trial, originally set for early March, was postponed pending appeals, increasing the likelihood of the Manhattan criminal trial taking place as planned on March 25, 2024.[220][221] On March 11, 2024, Trump's lawyers requested a delay of trial until after the federal election obstruction case on the basis that it would bolster his argument of presidential immunity, as some evidence and allegedly some acts overlapped with his time in office.[222] Trump's team cited, from April 2018, Trump's denying knowledge of the hush-money payment to reporters and tweeting in defense of Cohen's credibility.[223] Later on March 11, Merchan pointed out that Trump's team had missed the filing deadline and said either party would need his permission to file additional pretrial motions.[222] On March 3, the judge dismissed the request as untimely.[224] Also on March 11, Trump asked to delay trial until after the Supreme Court decides whether he is generally immune from prosecution in the federal charges on election obstruction. Granting the motion would have delayed trial until mid-summer or later, as the Supreme Court had already scheduled those arguments for April 25[225] and may not rule until the end of the court's term in early July.[226] Merchan denied the motion on April 3,[227] saying that he doubted its ""sincerity and actual purpose"", given that Trump made this request only two weeks before trial.[228] In March 2024, the U.S. Attorney's Office provided prosecutors with approximately 170,000 pages of documents, largely related to the 2017 federal probe of Cohen's payment to Daniels (and mostly reflecting evidence already turned over to Trump's lawyers in June 2023).[229][230][231] Trump's lawyers sought a delay in the trial on the basis of the newly produced records; the DA's office said in court that only 300 of the documents were relevant to Trump's defense.[232] On March 15, 2024, the judge delayed the start of trial until mid-April.[233] On March 25, 2024, the judge set a trial date of April 15, and denied a motion by Trump's team to further delay the trial.[232] On May 23, 2024, Merchan denied Trump's request to sanction prosecutors regarding the document release, ruling that the defense was provided sufficient time to respond.[234] On March 18, Trump's team requested an additional delay on the basis that pretrial publicity and apparent anti-Trump bias in Manhattan would prohibit a fair jury from being selected in April, although only 35% in the cited poll said they were convinced Trump was guilty in the DA's case specifically. Trump's lawyers cited berating statements by Cohen, e.g. saying he served jail time because his ""lying"" former boss ""couldn't keep his mushroom dick in his pants"". On March 25, the assistant DA countered that ""publicity is not likely to abate [and] the pretrial publicity has been ... exacerbated by the defendant"".[235] On April 8, Trump's team asked the appeals court for a delay to allow an attempt to move the trial to a different county, which was denied the same day.[202] On April 8, Trump requested to postpone the trial so the court could consider a change of venue, which was denied the same day,[236] and so he could appeal the gag order, which was denied the next day.[237] On April 10, the appeals court denied Trump's request to postpone trial on the basis of Merchan being unqualified.[238] On April 12, Merchan denied the defendant's request to delay trial on the basis of ""prejudicial"" media coverage.[239] On April 15, Merchan said Trump was ""required to be here"" on April 25 and ""not required to be at the Supreme Court"" that day, when it would hear arguments on his immunity claim in the federal election case.[240] Merchan said he was not yet prepared to say whether trial would be held on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron's high-school graduation, but indicated that he probably would grant him the day off if the proceedings progressed at an expected pace.[241] Trump subsequently complained that he would ""not be allowed"" to attend the graduation, but on April 30 the judge said he would be able to do so.[242] On May 17, Donald and Melania Trump attended their son's graduation from Oxbridge Academy at West Palm Beach, followed by a visit to Lincoln Reagan Dinner at the 2024 annual Minnesota Republican convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[243] In a May 2023 hearing and court filing, prosecutors expressed concern that Trump would misuse evidence obtained through pretrial discovery procedure to attack people involved in the case, including witnesses.[211] Justice Merchan declined to issue a gag order or prohibit Trump from publicly commenting about the case against him,[211] but issued a protective order setting rules for the use of social media involving elements of the case, and set a hearing (with Trump to appear remotely) to explain the rules.[244][245] At Trump's arraignment, on April 4, 2023, Merchan instructed Blanche to ""speak to your client and anybody else you need to, and remind them to please refrain, please refrain from making statements that are likely to incite violence or civil unrest. Please refrain from making comments or engaging in conduct that has the potential to incite violence, create civil unrest, or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.""[246] Blanche had stated that Trump was ""frustrated, upset, and believes that there is a grave injustice happening with him being in this courtroom today"" which Merchan rebuked ""I don't share your view that certain language and certain rhetoric is just by frustration.""[246] Merchan did not seek to impose a gag order at the time.[247] On February 26, 2024, the Manhattan DA asked for a gag order on Trump, noting that Trump has been fined $15,000 for two violations of a gag order in the civil fraud trial by disparaging the judge's law clerk on social media, and reporting that police had logged 89 threats to Bragg, his family, or staff in 2023 (as opposed to a single threat in 2022).[248] On March 7, Merchan ruled that the jury would be anonymous except to some involved in the trial, including Trump, his lawyers, and prosecutors.[249] On March 26, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump, restricting what he could say publicly about people involved in the case.[250] Additionally, the judge warned the defense, under the threat of contempt, against dilatory tactics such as the late filing of pretrial motions or last-minute demands, pointing out that Trump had ""stated publicly that the defense goal is to delay these proceedings ... past the 2024 presidential election"".[251][252] On March 26, Trump made online posts attacking the judge, the gag order, and Merchan's daughter, the latter over an anti-Trump social-media post created by someone impersonating her on social media.[253][254][255] The same day, Merchan imposed a gag order forbidding Trump to publicly comment on court staff, prosecutors, prospective jurors, or their families, or to cause others to make such statements, in a way that interferes with the case. Bragg (as a public figure) and Merchan (as the judge) were specifically exempted from protection.[256][257] The court also ordered Trump not to comment on prospective trial witnesses concerning their potential participation in the criminal case.[258] On March 27 and 28, Trump again attacked Merchan's daughter on social media.[257][259] On March 29, prosecutors requested that the limits of the gag order be explicated regarding family of court staff in hopes of terminating what they considered intentionally defiant behavior by Trump.[254][260] On April 1, Merchan expanded the gag order to protect his and Bragg's family members, saying attacks on them ""serve no legitimate purpose"".[261][262] He wrote that Trump's continued attacks posted a ""very real"" threat to the integrity of proceedings and could cause those involved in the case to fear for themselves and their families, which would ""undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself"".[263] On April 11, Trump disparaged expected witnesses Cohen and Daniels on social media, referring to them as dishonest ""sleaze bags"".[258] On May 6, Merchan found Trump in contempt of court for the tenth time, but stated that he did not wish to jail Trump due to the fact that Trump was a former and potentially the next president.[264] Contempt hearings were later held concerning numerous alleged violations of the gag order. On May 14, a New York appeals court denied Trump's request to overturn the order.[265] Also on May 14, United States Senator Tommy Tuberville called the gag order ""ridiculous"" for stopping Trump ""from having a say-so in his own trial""; Tuberville further said that members of Congress were attending the trial ""to speak our piece for President Trump"" and ""overcome this gag order"", and he hoped that ""more and more"" members of Congress would do so.[266] Republican members of Congress, including Tuberville, J. D. Vance, Cory Mills, Nicole Malliotakis and Speaker Mike Johnson, have criticized witness Michael Cohen, while Byron Donalds, Rick Scott, Vance, and Johnson have criticized Merchan's daughter.[267][268][269][270] New York magazine journalist Andrew Rice claimed that during Cohen's May 13 testimony, he saw Trump penning revision notes as to statements about the case from his Republican allies.[271] On May 14, Trump commented that ""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they're speaking very beautifully.""[272] On May 20, speaking outside the courtroom, Trump mentioned witnesses Robert Costello and Michael Cohen.[273] On June 25, Merchan lifted parts of Trump's gag order, allowing him to talk about the jury and witnesses who took the stand during the trial.[274] Merchan also stated that the gag order would be completely lifted following his July 11 sentencing.[275] In New York, the statute of limitations is typically two years for misdemeanors and five years for felonies.[276] Though falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor, in New York, the charges are upgraded to a felony when used to commit or conceal another crime.[276] Trump was charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which is a Class E felony (the least severe), whose statute of limitations is five years.[276] On March 20, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 202.8 tolling (pausing) the statute of limitations for ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state"".[276] Merchan ruled the tolling deadline was through May 6, 2021, thus extending the deadline for the prosecution by one year and 47 days, allowing the felony prosecution to commence within 6 years and 47 days from when the crime was committed.[276] Trump's first indictment occurred on February 14, 2017, and the indictment was filed on March 3, 2023, within days of the deadline.[276] On February 14, 2024, Merchan ruled that the tolled period was sufficient.[276] The New York statute of limitations provision, CPL§30.10, permits tolling of up to five years while the defendant is continuously outside the state.[276] During his presidency, Trump spent the majority of his time outside New York.[276] Merchan declined to address where this provision was applicable as the tolling occasioned by the Governor's Executive Order was sufficient.[277] The trial began on April 15, 2024, with recessed Wednesdays.[278] Trump was required to attend every day of trial barring a court-approved absence.[279] If he chose to testify, prosecutors could have asked him about his civil lawsuits regarding business fraud, sexual abuse, and defamation as well as the 2018 dissolution of his charitable foundation.[280] Attorneys Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles represented him.[281] The trial was not televised.[282] Initially, Merchan allowed photographers to stand at the front of the room for a few minutes each morning before the trial began to take photos of Trump seated. Merchan withdrew this permission on May 9 after at least one photo was taken from the side of the table.[283] There are courtroom sketch artists present to capture the milieu.[284][r] The temperature in the trial courtroom was a point of contention, with Trump repeatedly complaining that it was too cold, akin to an icebox, possibly intentionally.[289][290][291] Judge Juan Merchan acknowledged that the courtroom was chilly, but has stated that he would rather it be a little cold than too hot, and that climate control is limited in the 80-year-old building.[292][291] Despite Trump's complaints, reporters in the courtroom noted that the temperature was not as cold as he claims.[293] On April 8, 2024, the judge gave attorneys a copy of the jury selection questionnaire,[294] with jury selection beginning on April 15[295][296] from a pool of over 500 candidates.[297] Over the first two days, 96 potential jurors appeared, of which more than half were immediately dismissed after indicating that they could not be impartial. Nine jurors provisionally qualified on the first day, and an additional ten on the second;[298][299][300] from these 19, seven jurors were selected and sworn in.[s] However, two were excused on April 18, one of whom complaining that her friends and family had recognized her from details published in the news.[300][303][304] Trump was reprimanded by the judge on April 16 for gesturing and audibly speaking in the direction of a potential juror.[305][306] Another group of 96 potential jurors was brought in later in the week.[304] Twelve jurors, along with one alternate, were selected by April 18.[307] The selection of six alternate jurors concluded on April 19.[308][309] The jury reportedly comprised seven men and five women, who mostly had white-collar careers.[310] The jurors were allowed to tell their family and employers that they were on the jury but could not discuss the case with them.[311] Trump was described as falling asleep for brief intervals on four out of the first five days of the trial, ahead of opening statements,[312][313][314][315][316] and as being flatulent.[t] Trump has denied dozing off at his trial.[u] On April 22, opening statements began.[328] Prosecutors accused Trump, Cohen, and Pecker of campaign finance violations, alleging they coordinated payments to two women and concealed them as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.[329] During their opening statements, prosecutors said the jury would be presented with a document with a handwritten note in the margin by Allen Weisselberg outlining the hush-money payment scheme.[330][331] The defense argued that the testimony of Cohen, a convicted felon, could not be trusted; that the payments were ordinary business transactions, akin to editorial decisions made by newspapers;[332] and that in democracies it is normal for candidates to attempt to influence an election.[329] On April 15, prosecutors asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for three alleged violations of the gag order against him;[307] prosecutors also requested to use the attacks on Cohen as evidence.[298][258][333] By the morning of April 18, prosecutors alleged that Trump incurred seven further violations of the order and requested that he be fined another $7,000.[307] On April 23, Merchan heard arguments about whether Trump had violated the earlier gag order when he made social-media posts about two expected witnesses.[334] Merchan criticized Trump's attorney Todd Blanche for failing to justify Trump's claim that he was merely responding to ""political attacks"" and for failing to provide any legal precedent supporting Trump's claim that reposting an article could not be a violation of a gag order; Merchan told Blanche, ""You're losing credibility.""[334][335] Merchan rejected Trump's position that reposting a news article to social media was a merely ""passive"" rather than active act.[336][v] The defense also declared that ""Trump absolutely knows what the gag order allows him to do and does not allow him to do.""[336] On April 30, Trump became the first U.S. president ever to be held in criminal contempt of court, under NY Judiciary Law Section 750(3).[337] (Trump had previously been held in civil contempt, for withholding documents, in the New York business fraud case.)[338] Trump was found in contempt on nine of the ten counts, regarding statements made from April 10–17.[339] Over the next few days, he paid a $9,000 fine.[340][341][342] Merchan said he would consider jailing Trump for further violations ""if necessary and appropriate"".[343] On May 2, a second hearing was held to consider four further violation claims.[w] The prosecution said it was ""not yet seeking jail"".[348][349] On May 6, Trump was found in contempt for one of those four claims (when he on April 22 commented on the jury) and was fined $1,000.[x] The judge again warned Trump of possible incarceration for further violations.[352] The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said that corrections officials would be ""ready"" if the judge ordered incarceration.[353] Prosecutors called former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker to testify on April 22, 23, 25 and 26 as the trial's first witness, taking most of the first week of testimony.[354] He had been given immunity in 2018 in a federal investigation into Michael Cohen in exchange for information regarding hush money deals.[355] During Pecker's testimony, it was implied that former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who Pecker stated was now living in Australia and suffering from a ""spinal condition"", would not testify.[354][356] It was previously reported that while Pecker and his company American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirer's parent company, facilitated payment to McDougal,[357] Pecker refused to personally do the same with Daniels,[358][359] though he allegedly alerted Trump associates about Daniels' decision to go public with her affair allegation.[360] On April 23, Pecker testified that Cohen used to feed him negative stories about Trump's enemies, which Pecker's staff would then ""embellish"" and show drafts to Cohen to get his feedback before publishing them.[361] Pecker also detailed how he offered to deploy the ""catch and kill"" scheme, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and flag efforts by women attempting to sell stories about him.[362] The prosecution cited a state election law regarding conspiracy to defend their questioning of Pecker about his contacts with Steve Bannon, the chief executive officer of Trump's 2016 campaign.[363] On April 25, Pecker testified that AMI suppressed negative press about other celebrities, which was emphasized by Trump's team in their cross-examination.[364] Additionally, he stated that he did not believe Cohen was working for Trump's campaign.[365] Pecker discussed his relationship with Trump prior to the 2016 campaign, during which he suppressed other negative stories about him. Pecker detailed how his company, Trump and Cohen facilitated payment to McDougal in mid-2016, in tandem with promising her a ghostwritten monthly column in an attempt to disguise the contract's true nature.[364][282][366] In September 2016, Cohen asked to purchase the boxes of McDougal's source material (valued by Pecker at $25,000) on Trump's behalf. Pecker then told Cohen that he did not want to be reimbursed for the payment to McDougal. According to Pecker, an AMI staff member leaked details of the scheme on November 4, 2016, ahead of the election, after which Pecker released a false statement that AMI had never paid anyone to kill damaging stories about Trump. AMI then amended its contract with McDougal allowing her to speak to the press.[366] Pecker also described a January 2017 meeting in Trump Tower in which Trump thanked Pecker for his work regarding McDougal and another story.[366][367][y] Pecker said his decision not to facilitate payment to Daniels (because she was a porn star) led to it being done by Cohen.[364] Pecker testified he acted at Trump's behest and intended to help him win the presidency, despite his own doubts regarding campaign-finance laws.[366][368] Additionally, Pecker said that after receiving a letter from the Federal Election Commission about possible campaign violations in mid-2021, he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors for his cooperation.[366] Four witnesses testified over the latter part of April 26 through the earlier part of April 30. On April 26, Trump's executive assistant Rhona Graff testified that when she worked outside Trump's office in Trump Tower, she maintained contact information for McDougal and Daniels,[369] and that she had a ""vague recollection"" of glimpsing Daniels at a Trump Tower reception area.[370] During her cross-examination by the defense, Graff said Trump was sometimes prone to multitasking while signing checks, depending ""what was going on ... and how important the checks were"".[17][371] Additional testimony was also provided by former First Republic banker Gary Farro on April 26 and 30. He testified that on October 26, 2016, he helped Cohen open an account for a real-estate limited liability company. According to prosecutors, the same day, Cohen deposited $131,000 from his personal home-equity credit line, and the next day transferred $130,000 to Daniels' lawyer, Keith Davidson.[370][372][373] He detailed how he assisted in setting up the bank account which enabled Cohen to make the hush money payment. Farro stated that Cohen was eager to connect with him, and would set up the account in October 2016. Farro also noted that the account was set up for Essential Consultants LLC, the company the payment was made from, and that it was funded through Cohen's home-equity line of credit at First Republic.[373][374] According to Farro, Cohen did not want addresses on the checks.[373] Prosecution also presented evidence showing emails to and from Cohen, which confirmed the $131,000 deposit to a checking account 20 minutes after it was opened.[374] In texts between Davidson and Cohen, Davidson provided wiring instructions for the $130,000 hush-money payment. According to Farro, First Republic closed Cohen's accounts after the payment to Daniels became public.[375] April 30 also saw testimony from C-SPAN Executive Director for Archives Robert Browning, who verified the authenticity of C-SPAN videos of Trump, as well as Phillip Thompson, a regional director of Esquire Deposition Solutions, which provided court reporter services for Trump's October 2022 deposition in one of the E. Jean Carroll defamation cases.[376][377] On May 20, the prosecution tried to contact Browning to see if he would be available to testify again, this time regarding a photograph of Trump with his former bodyguard Keith Schiller.[378][379] Keith Davidson, a former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, appeared on April 30 and May 2. He testified that the Access Hollywood tape helped influence Daniels to go forward with her story.[380] According to Davidson's testimony, he drafted the $130,000 hush-money agreement, in which he used the pseudonyms ""Peggy Peterson"" for Daniels and ""David Dennison"" for Trump.[381] The agreement called for payment by October 14, 2016. When the payment did not arrive, Davidson communicated with Cohen,[382] who told him that Trump was traveling.[383] On October 17, Davidson wrote to Cohen that the agreement was void and furthermore that he would no longer be representing Daniels.[384] (Cohen would wire his personal funds to Davidson on October 27.)[385] Davidson testified that he believed Trump was behind the hush-money talks.[386] However, he also acknowledged how Cohen wired the transfer and that he also had conversations with Howard as well as Daniels' manager Gina Rodriguez regarding the deal. Howard and Rodriguez, who had no direct roles, would encourage Davidson to connect with Cohen. Daniels, Davidson and Rodriguez were also revealed to have received part of the $130,000 settlement payment. Davidson's role in the $150,000 deal with AMI for McDougal's story was noted as well.[375] On May 2, the jury heard an audio recording of Cohen and Trump from September 6, 2016 appearing to discuss paying Pecker for McDougal's story, wherein Cohen mentions talking to Weisselberg about setting up the payment and Trump asks, ""So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""[387] Further audio was played of a phone call in which Cohen tells Davidson that ""I can't even tell you how many times [Trump] said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it,"" apparently regarding the payment to Daniels.[157] Davidson acknowledged texting Howard on Election Night 2016: ""What have we done?"", to which Howard responded ""Oh my god.""[158] Davidson explained that this was a recognition that ""our activities may have assisted the presidential campaign"" and that it was ""sort of gallows humor"".[388] He also confirmed that, after texting with Cohen on February 13, 2018, he sent a statement to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to corroborate Cohen's claim of having paid $130,000 to Daniels from his personal funds.[389] Davidson testified during his cross-examination that he had never personally met Trump.[157] On May 2, prosecutors called Douglas Daus, a computer forensics specialist in the district attorney's office. Daus testified to examinations of Cohen's cell phones. Several of the prosecutions proposed exhibits were found by Daus.[390] On May 3, former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified. She said a Wall Street Journal reporter asked her for comment on the alleged Trump–McDougal affair, which is how she learned that AMI had paid to catch and kill the story.[391] She stated that she drafted a statement to respond to The Wall Street Journal, with Cohen offering feedback, but Trump overrode them by telling Hicks to say that McDougal's allegations were ""totally untrue"",[392][393] which is how she was quoted by the Journal just days before the election.[394][357] Hicks also learned at this time that the Journal planned to publish details of Daniels' allegations, with Trump instructing Hicks to deny any affair.[395] Hicks stated that Trump sought to hide news of both scandals from Melania,[396][395] and after the story of the payment to Daniels broke in early 2018, Trump told her that Cohen had voluntarily decided to pay Daniels to protect him; Hicks opined that this seemed out of character for Cohen.[395] Trump sought Hicks's opinion about how the Daniels story was being perceived, especially in relation to the negative impact it may have had if Cohen had not paid Daniels before the election.[393][397] Hicks further testified that she had heard Trump praise Pecker on multiple occasions for his negative reporting on his Republican rivals in the 2016 election.[395] According to Hicks, the Access Hollywood tape roiled the Trump campaign.[395] Though Trump tried to minimize its significance,[398] the campaign felt the tape was a ""crisis"".[399] Hicks stated that the tape's release stressed Trump because he wanted members of his family, including Melania, to be proud of him and not hurt or embarrassed.[400] In her cross-examination by the defense, Hicks stated that Trump ""is a very good multitasker [who] is always doing many things at once"".[371] Three witnesses appeared during May 6 and the earlier part of May 7. On May 6, former Trump Organization comptroller Jeffrey McConney testified about how Cohen was reimbursed.[401] He testified that Weisselberg instructed him in early 2017 to send the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401][402][403] McConney acknowledged that he told organization payroll specialist (and its accounts payable supervisor) Deborah Tarasoff to record the reimbursement payments as ""legal expenses""; he said he told her these payments were part of a retainer agreement between Cohen and Trump.[401] McConney further stated that starting in March 2017, the reimbursement checks for Cohen came from Trump's personal bank account.[401] In 2017, Cohen quit working for Trump after setting up shop at Squire Patton Boggs's offices in Midtown, but nevertheless still identified himself as Trump's personal lawyer.[401] Numerous invoice messages from Cohen and related emails between McConney, Tarasoff and Weisselberg were shown in the courtroom.[401] Several general ledger documents associated with Trump and his trust were reviewed which showed that Trump made the reimbursement payments to Cohen.[401] Following McConney's testimony, Deborah Tarasoff, a 24-year employee of the Trump Organization who works in accounting, took the stand to testify. She said the organization was paying for her attorney.[404][401] She described her job duties: ""I get approved bills, I enter them into the system, and I cut checks.""[405] Tarasoff stated that she had no decision-making authority and merely followed instructions, but also acknowledged that she would approve invoices if she got them, including the ones which were sent to Cohen.[402] Tarasoff testified that while either Trump or one of his two older sons could approve invoices of over $10,000 since 2015, only Trump could access his personal checking account.[402] Twelve reimbursement checks for $35,000 were signed by Trump, and Tarasoff testified that they were mailed to Cohen.[402] Trump, who used a Sharpie pen when writing checks, could write ""void"" if he disapproved of checks Tarasoff created for the company[402] (e.g. a $70,000 check to Cohen signed by Eric Trump and Wiesselberg in February 2017, which was voided by Trump).[402] She testified that Weisselberg ""had his hands in everything"".[403] During cross-examination, Tarasoff acknowledged that she not was present for conversations between Trump and Weisselberg about the payments.[402] On May 7, 2024, Penguin Books executive Sally Franklin testified. Franklin, whose company published a few Trump books, read excerpts from Trump: How to Get Rich and Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, including Trump quotes, ""If you don't know every aspect of what you're doing, down to the paper clips, you're setting yourself up for some unwanted surprises,"" and, ""For many years, I've said that if someone screws you, screw them back.""[406] Stormy Daniels testified for five hours on May 7,[407] and for the earlier part of May 9.[408] She said she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006 and detailed a sexual encounter with Trump in his hotel suite after he invited her to dinner.[407][409] Daniels stated that Trump did not use a condom and that during the encounter, ""I was staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I got there,"" despite not having used drugs or alcohol.[407][z] She said she felt like she blacked out during the encounter and was traumatized by the experience.[411][409] It was the only time they reputedly had sex.[412] Daniels said Trump offered to make her a contestant on The Apprentice; she stated that he continued alluding to the idea for a time in subsequent phone conversations, in which he referred to her as ""honey bunch"" and asked when they could meet again.[406][409] Daniels noted that she met with Trump on multiple occasions, with dozens of witnesses,[409] including a visit to Trump Tower and a final encounter with Trump in Los Angeles in 2007.[409] In accepting the hush money, Daniels stated that she was not motivated by money (although this appeared to be contradicted by a text message between her and her manager Gina Rodriguez which suggested she was willing to accept the payment).[409] She stated that she had no part in the hush-money negotiations.[409] Daniels also laid out key information about the payment.[409] She maintained her previous allegation that someone threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot, stating that she did not report it because it would have been upsetting to Trump.[409] Daniels stated that any violation of the hush-money agreement would have cost her a million dollars.[409] During Daniels' testimony, Merchan sustained many defense objections.[409] He repeatedly admonished Daniels for giving answers that went beyond the scope of the question asked, and at one point interrupting Daniels' testimony, stopping her from describing the sexual position she and Trump used.[407][409] Merchan criticized the ""degree of detail"" on matters such as the floor size of the hotel suite.[406] In a sidebar conference, Merchan agreed with defense arguments that Daniels described things which were ""better left unsaid"" regarding the sexual encounter, but denied the defense's request for a mistrial, noting that the defense would have the opportunity to cross-examine Daniels.[407][409] Merchan set confines for Daniels' later testimony and directed the prosecution to encourage her to give shorter answers.[409] Afterward, Daniels gave shorter answers and hewed closer to the question asked.[407] When testimony resumed, Daniels stated that her lawyer Keith Davidson received the $130,000 hush-money payment, and that she got $96,000 of it. She also acknowledged that she signed a statement dated January 10, 2018, in which she denied the affair, but testified that she did not want to sign it and that it was untrue.[409] In its cross-examination, the defense questioned Daniels about her account of being traumatized by her encounter with Trump, suggesting that her pornographic career would have made the event unsurprising. Daniels explained that the first time she realized the meeting was intended to be sexual was upon coming out of the bathroom inside Trump's hotel, finding him stripped to his boxers; she elaborated that she was ""not expecting [this from] a man twice [her] age"".[411] Daniels acknowledged that she had contacted renowned high-profile sexual harassment attorney Gloria Allred about potentially suing Trump for the encounter. Much of the cross-examination focused on questioning the accuracy of her allegation that she was threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot, which was revealed to have been disputed by Davidson via texts with Cohen. Despite accepting the hush money, Daniels maintained that her primary goal was to ""get the story out"".[409] On May 9, Daniels concluded her testimony after hours of cross-examination.[408] Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Daniels on how she profited from her story and brought up minor inconsistencies in how she has told it.[408] Merchan again denied a defense motion for a mistrial, but would provide the jury instructions instructions limiting the use of her testimony.[413][414] [aa] Trump criticized Merchan for permitting the testimony stating ""He’s [Merchan] trying to make it as salacious as possible by allowing testimony that has nothing to do with the case.""[418] On May 9, Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization, testified for about a half-hour. She had provided evidence to the prosecution.[419][420] Tracy Menzies, a senior vice president at HarperCollins, then testified about the accuracy of certain excerpts from the book Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life, which Trump had co-authored.[421] Trump's director of Oval Office Operations in 2019 and former Secretary to the President between 2017 and 2019, Madeleine Westerhout, also began testifying the same day.[408][414] She stated that Republican National Committee officials she was working with in 2016 discussed how to replace Trump as the Republican presidential nominee due to concern about the damaging Access Hollywood tape.[422] She also noted how she set up a meeting between Cohen and Trump in February 2017, and how the meeting led to Trump Organization employees sending reimbursement checks to the White House—which Trump would then sign and send to Cohen—through a circuitous mail system.[423] She was in tears when discussing how Trump fired her, reportedly in response to her telling reporters that she had a better relationship with him than his daughters.[424] Westerhout resumed testifying on May 10.[423] During cross-examination, Westerhout appeared to side with defense arguments that Trump used alternatives to the White House mail system because he wanted to get mail to people more quickly.[423] For the later part of May 10, four other witnesses testified.[425] Among these witnesses were Jennie Tomalin (a Verizon senior analyst), Daniel Dixon (an AT&T compliance analyst), and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider (a paralegal from the Manhattan DA's office).[423] In successive testimonies, Dixon and Tomalin would authenticate cell phone records which were used as trial evidence.[423] Georgia Longstreet, another paralegal from the Manhattan DA's office, again testified after previously doing so days prior.[423] Longstreet also showed some of Trump's old tweets, as well as texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard.[423] Jarmel-Schneider then showed a chart which summarized 34 business records which prosecutors say were falsified.[423] On May 13, Michael Cohen, Trump's former ""fixer"" and attorney (who is considered the case's star witness), began testifying.[426] He would give 17 hours of testimony over four days.[427] On May 13, Cohen acknowledged that he, Trump and David Pecker conspired to suppress negative stories and promote positive stories about Trump during the 2016 election.[426] He said his work in this matter ""was at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump"", stating that ""Everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off.""[428] By email (shown as evidence), Cohen informed the National Enquirer that Trump did not want them to report his affair with a ""Penthouse Pet"".[426] Cohen specified his role in the Enquirer's first catch-and-kill story for Trump, about a Trump Tower doorman who alleged that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.[426] Cohen detailed his role in the hush-money payment to McDougal, stating that he monitored progress by text, phone and the Signal app.[426] He repeated that he communicated by ""phone, email and text"" with McDougal, Daniels and Keith Davidson.[426][9] By text message, Cohen told Dylan Howard that he was making the payments on Trump's behalf.[426] He further noted that after Pecker refused to pay for the Daniels story, he took over as funder of ""catch-and-kill operations"".[426] Cohen acknowledged Hicks's testimony about the conversation over the McDougal payment press coverage.[426] According to Cohen, he and everybody at the organization had contact with Weisselberg.[426] He further accused Weisselberg of providing him with the financial advice concerning the payment to McDougal, stating that it foreshadowed the way he arranged for the Daniels payment.[426] Cohen said he first spoke to Trump about the Daniels allegation in 2011 after it was leaked to The Dirty, and that Trump called her ""a beautiful woman"" (having said the same about McDougal) and said they had met in 2006 at a golf outing and that she had liked him more than football star ""Big Ben"". Cohen said Trump did not respond when he asked if he had had sex with her and that Trump took him up on his offer to get the story taken down.[9] Cohen said the release of the Access Hollywood tape was viewed as a campaign liability and that Trump afterwards directed him to pay Daniels to avoid ""catastrophic"" damage.[426][9] Cohen said that he viewed supermarket tabloids like the National Enquirer to be influential in reaching voters[426] and that Trump was concerned about the effect Daniels' story could have had on female voters.[426] Cohen stated that Trump told him: ""Just pay it. There's no reason to keep this thing out there. Just do it.""[429] Cohen testified that Weisselberg told him to not make the payment through the Trump Organization and instead to come up with a more creative way to do it.[426] Cohen said that he and Weisselberg discussed processing the $130,000 through one of Trump's golf courses as if it were a membership or event fee but they decided against it. When Weisselberg said he lacked the personal finances, Cohen agreed to pay it.[429] Cohen said he suggested the idea of including a clause in the nondisclosure agreement penalizing Daniels $1,000,000 every time she told her story.[426] After Trump's 2016 election victory, Weisselberg and Cohen discussed the reimbursement plan in Trump's 26th-floor office, and Weisselberg coordinated the repayments to Cohen.[426] A bank statement for Essential Consultants LLC from the end of October 2016 was presented, which showed the $130,000 sent to Keith Davidson and featured a note Cohen said was handwritten by Weisselberg. It showed the doubling of the $180,000 reimbursement—$130,000 for Daniels plus $50,000 for money Trump owed Cohen for paying tech company Red Finch (to poll for the Trump campaign and promote Cohen on Twitter as something of a sex symbol)—so that Cohen would receive the full amount after paying 50% in taxes, plus a $60,000 year-end bonus, totaling $420,000. Cohen said it occurred to him that Weisselberg and Trump had planned this reimbursement scheme in advance and that Weisselberg had said in Trump's presence that the monthly payments would function in the guise of a retainer agreement.[430][401] Cohen testified that he aspired to be a personal lawyer to the president but that Trump, instead of granting him this role, significantly cut his 2016 bonus. Cohen said his relationship with Trump was falling apart at this time. He said his work for Trump boosted his personal career, including by securing more prominent clients.[426] On May 14, Cohen said he sent the Trump Organization false invoices requesting money for ""services rendered"". He said that, in February 2017, he confronted Trump in the Oval Office over his lack of repayment.[431] He said he lied about Daniels to protect Trump (while also ""staying on Trump's message"" by lying about the Trump Tower Moscow project).[432] Cohen testified that, in January 2018, he pressured Davidson to have Daniels sign a false statement denying the affair and payment, which Daniels signed on January 30, and also offered her an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity.[433][434] Cohen testified that Daniels also wanted an appearance on Fox News' Hannity, which she did not go through with.[435][434] Cohen also testified that he decided to stop lying for Trump following a meeting he had with his family shortly before his 2018 guilty plea.[435] Before the day concluded, Cohen began defense cross-examination.[435] On May 16, a Trump lawyer accused Cohen of lying that on October 26, 2016, he was on the phone with Trump's personal bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and had him hand the phone to Trump, who then approved the hush-money deal. The defense cited phone records as showing that a series of prank calls to Cohen had prompted him to contact Schiller for a call lasting one minute and 36 seconds, which Cohen defended as enough time to handle both matters.[436] On May 20, during cross-examination, Cohen confirmed that around October 26, 2016, he helped Tiffany Trump regarding an extortion issue she faced. He said he was also working with David Pecker that month.[437] Cohen made two brief calls to Donald Trump on the morning of October 26,[438] which he said were about Daniels.[439] On January 27, 2017, Cohen told the Trump Organization he would no longer be working at Trump Tower because he was now Trump's ""personal attorney"".[440] On January 31, 2017, Weisselberg emailed Cohen with the subject: ""Note and mortgage modification agreement for Trump Park Avenue Condominium."" Weisselberg asked Cohen to ""prepare the agreement discussed"" so Weisselberg could start sending monthly payments.[441] Cohen said that Donald Jr. and Eric Trump signed the checks ""because they were the trustees"".[442] In 2017, he received nine checks for $35,000 apiece directly from Trump, plus two checks from the trust.[443] Cohen confirmed that he lied to Weisselberg about how much he had paid Red Finch, and that his false reimbursement request amounted to theft from the organization.[444][445][446][447] He said he lied in 2018 when he said that Trump had been unaware of the Daniels payment.[448] He said he had no income between his 2018 guilty plea[449] and the publication of his 2020 memoir,[450] but that since then he had earned $4.4 million from podcasts and books.[451] Asked whether he has a ""financial interest in the outcome of this case"", Cohen said he expected to make more money if Trump was found not guilty, since ""it gives me more to talk about"".[452][453] He acknowledged that his name recognition comes from his frequent criticism of Trump and that he was even interested in running for Congress.[446] Defense cross-examination of Cohen concluded on May 20. Cohen testified that the retainer agreement Weisselberg proposed he maintain with Trump to conceal the monthly reimbursements was fraudulent in nature.[454][430] The defense pointed to occasions when Cohen did legal work, and said this was evidence that he was retained as a lawyer under a valid retainer agreement, as Cohen would not do legal work for free, nor would Trump pay in excess of reimbursements. Additionally, the defense pointed out that CFO Weisselberg requested from Cohen an agreement without suggesting it would be a fake agreement: ""please prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly.""[455][456][457] The prosecution then conducted redirect examination. The prosecution rested its case the same day.[458][459][460] The defense began its case on May 20, 2024, and rested its case on May 21 after calling two witnesses.[427][461] Trump did not testify.[462][463][ab] On May 22, he stated (in a press interview outside the court proceedings) that he did not testify because (1) he disagreed with Merchan's past rulings, (2) he was concerned about being questioned about his own past, and (3) there was ""no case"".[464][471][ac] The defense team had initially planned to call Bradley Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as an expert witness on campaign finance law.[473] Smith had argued that the payments to Daniels were not campaign payments and not illegal.[474] However, on May 20, Judge Merchan ruled that Smith's testimony would be limited to ""general definitions and terms"" so as to not supplant the judge's role to determine what the law is.[475][476] Smith was prohibited from mentioning ""there had never been a case in which anyone had been convicted of a federal campaign finance law violation for the making of 'hush money payments'"" and from discussing ""that the FEC dismissed the complaint against defendant and the DOJ decided against prosecuting defendant for potential FECA violations"" due to irrelevance.[477] In February 2024, prosecutors pointed out that Smith had previously been barred from testifying for the defense in two unrelated federal cases in Manhattan where the defense had improperly sought to have Smith interpret campaign finance law for the jury: United States v. Bankman-Fried and United States v. Suarez.[476] As a result, the defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.[478][479] Trump then falsely stated that Merchan had not allowed Smith to be called,[480] and Smith wrote that the ""judge's bias is very evident.""[481] On May 20, Daniel Sitko, a paralegal for Todd Blanche, provided testimony.[482] A chart of phone calls between Cohen and Robert Costello, the lawyer that Giuliani suggested Cohen hire in 2018, was submitted into evidence.[483] On May 20, Robert Costello also testified.[484] Merchan admonished the witness for making comments on the stand objecting to rulings, staring at the judge, and rolling his eyes.[485] On May 21, Costello was cross-examined by the prosecution.[486] Emails from Costello to his law partner Jeff Citron and Cohen were shown. In a May 2018 email to Citron, Costello said it was a goal to get Cohen ""on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president"" and said he believed it was ""the clear and correct strategy"".[486][487] When asked if ""the email speaks for itself"" as he had asserted the day before, Costello said ""Sometimes."" He also wrote to Citron about Cohen, ""What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet."" (Cohen testified that Costello and Trump's campaign had attempted to pressure him to realign to their interests.)[486] In an email to Cohen, Costello wrote: ""You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these 'journalists' are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed. If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your opinion known.""[486] The defense rested its case thereafter.[486] Later on May 21, arguments over jury instruction language were held.[486] Merchan announced that the jury would be excused until the beginning of summations on May 28.[486][463] Merchan stated that the closing arguments ""will not be quick"" and that he expected his final instructions to the jury to last an hour.[486] On Memorial Day, May 27, Trump complained that the prosecution would get the last word as ""very unfair"", though this is standard procedure in criminal trials where the state has the burden of proof.[488][ad] On May 28, the defense gave a three-hour closing argument including breaks.[492] Trump lawyer Todd Blanche claimed Trump had nothing to do with checks which were written by Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[493] Blanche questioned why prosecutors did not call Donald Jr. and Eric as witnesses despite their signing payment checks to Cohen.[493] Blanche also showed an email revealing that McConnery sought approval from both Donald Jr. and Eric.[493] Blanche alleged that it was Cohen's decision to make the hush-money payment and variously branded him a prolific liar.[493] Blanche sought to discredit Daniels' ambitions, noting (among other things) text messages between her manager and publicist Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard which showed that Howard believed Pecker would pay for her story shortly after the Access Hollywood tape was released.[493] Merchan admonished Blanche for telling the jury: ""You cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict somebody, based upon the words of Michael Cohen."" Merchan said this type of comment is ""highly inappropriate"" and ""not allowed"",[494] as the jury is instructed not to consider how Merchan might sentence Trump.[495][496][497] The same day, the prosecution gave a four-hour and 41 minute closing argument including breaks.[493] Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass described Pecker's testimony as ""utterly damning"".[493] Steinglass noted that some key parts of Daniels' story were proven true[493] and noted that the defense appeared to acknowledge that Trump knew about the Daniels payment as early as 2017.[493] Steinglass stated that it made sense that Cohen was interested in the outcome of the case, noting that Trump dropped him ""like a hot potato"" when their relationship soured.[498] Steinglass argued that Cohen was Trump's ""fixer"" and that his knowledge was ""limited to what actually happened"".[493] It was noted that Cohen did not work for the Trump Organization's legal department and answered directly to Trump.[493] A footnote from the 2018 Office of Government Ethics form was shown, which stated that ""In 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump's attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.""[493] Steinglass went over phone conversations between Trump and Cohen regarding the hush-money payment and showed a December 2017 check to Cohen signed via Sharpie by Donald Trump,[493] arguing that the latter must have known the purpose of such checks, as his ""entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything"".[499] Steinglass cited a 2018 tweet by Trump in which he acknowledged that Cohen was reimbursed for an NDA via a retainer agreement, but said it had ""nothing to do with the campaign"".[499] Steinglass said the defense's characterization of the payments to Cohen was undermined by his lack of pay from Trump in 2018 despite Cohen doing legal work for him that year.[499] Steinglass further stated that the payment was made to ""hoodwink the American voter"".[493][500] At the end of closing arguments, Merchan said that jury instructions would be read on May 29 and were expected to last an hour.[493] Trump described the closing arguments as ""BORING!"" on Truth Social.[501][502][503] On May 29, the jury began deliberations.[504] A few hours in, they asked to hear a readback of about 30 minutes of testimony by Pecker and Cohen; the readback was held the following day.[505] It regarded an August 2015 meeting between Pecker, Cohen, Trump, and Hicks, in which Pecker pledged to be Trump's ""eyes and ears"" regarding negative stories about him; additionally, the jury wanted to hear Pecker's testimony regarding an alleged phone call from Trump in which the two discussed a rumor that McDougal had gone to another outlet to publish her story.[506][507][508] On May 30 at 5:07 pm EDT, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts,[1][509] making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony.[510] Merchan denied a defense motion for an acquittal.[511] On May 31, 2024, the day after the trial ended, Trump told reporters he wanted to have the ""nasty gag order"" lifted.[512] On June 4, Blanche filed a motion to have the gag order lifted, stating: ""Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the Court do not justify restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump"".[513] On June 5, Matthew Colangelo asked that the gag order remain in place to ""to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.""[514][515] Many expected Trump, had the gag order been lifted, to assail trial participants including the witnesses, jury, and court staff, as well as their families.[516][517] On June 18, the New York Court of Appeals said it would not hear an earlier appeal by Trump on the gag order, leaving it in place.[518] On June 25, two days before the first 2024 United States presidential debates, Merchan partially lifted the gag order permitting Trump to comment on witnesses and jurors, but Trump cannot reveal the jurors' identities, nor comment about court staffers, the prosecution team nor their families until after sentencing.[519][520][521] On June 10, 2024, Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche attended his probation interview via videoconference.[522][ae] If placed on probation, Trump cannot associate with other convicted felons.[523][527] Before his conviction, officials in state and federal agencies began preparing for possible incarceration.[528][529] Trump's rhetoric and lack of acknowledgement of any wrongdoing is expected to negatively impact the leniency of his sentence.[530] Trump's proponents have argued that any sentence restricting Trump's mobility or communication with voters could undermine confidence in the 2024 election.[531] Trump was the presumptive 2024 Republican Party nominee leading up to the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the party prepared for a prison nomination broadcast were he to be incarcerated before the start of the Republican National Convention on July 15.[532] Trump's sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for July 11.[533] However, Trump's counsel requested on July 1 to delay sentencing to consider the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States released that day.[222][534] The Manhattan DA's office agreed to the delay, though it said the Trump team's position lacked merit.[535] On July 2, Merchan postponed the sentencing hearing to September 18.[536] On August 14, Trump's team asked the judge to postpone the sentencing hearing until after the election.[537] On August 19, the Manhattan District Attorney stated it would defer to Merchan for delaying sentencing.[538] On August 29, Trump's lawyers asked a federal court to seize control of the case, complaining that a September sentencing date would amount to election interference.[539] On September 3, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump's request.[540] On July 1, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States, supporting presidential immunity for official acts committed by the seated president. Later that day, Trump's counsel requested permission to move to dismiss the conviction on the basis that some evidence presented in the trial constituted official actions by Trump.[222][534] This includes 2018 social media posts by Trump, phone records between Trump and Cohen, a government ethics disclosure referencing the hush money payment, and some of Hicks' and Westerhout's testimony.[541][542][543] Trump's motion was formally made on July 11.[543] Merchan's ruling will center on whether the evidence presented constituted official actions, and whether it influenced the verdict.[541] If the conviction is overturned, prosecutors would need to convene another grand jury to issue a new indictment.[543] Judge Hellerstein had previously rejected defense arguments to this effect in July 2023 when Trump attempted to remove the case to federal court, saying that ""the matter was purely a personal item of the President.""[352] Merchan's ruling on immunity was initially expected by September 6. It was postponed so he could consider Trump's third recusal motion, which he denied on August 13.[544] The immunity ruling is expected by September 16.[545][546] On September 3, hours before Hellerstein rejected Trump's request to remove his case to federal court, prosecutors urged Merchan to rule swiftly on the immunity question, expressing concern that Hellerstein might pause state court proceedings.[547] Trump had turned over two of the three pistols he was licensed for to the New York Police Department (NYPD) on March 31, 2023, with a third pistol moved to Florida.[548] Trump's New York State concealed carry license was suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges.[549] New York state law and federal law prohibit people with felony convictions from possessing firearms, and federal law even prohibits people under indictment or information for a felony (but not convicted) from possessing firearms, a violation of which can result in up to 15 years imprisonment, or life imprisonment if one is subject to the enhanced penalties imposed by the Armed Career Criminal Act.[550] [551] As of June 5, 2024, Trump's New York firearm license is expected to be revoked after the NYPD's legal bureau completes its investigation.[552] At Trump's pre-sentence hearing on June 10, 2024, CNN reported that Trump was still in possession of the third firearm in Florida.[553][554] On June 28, 2024, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control declined to renew the liquor licenses for Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and Colts Neck, instead issuing temporary permits.[555] The alcohol laws of New Jersey prohibit a liquor license from being issued to ""any person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude"", typically involving a serious crime involving ""dishonesty, fraud or depravity"".[555][556][557] Though the Trump Organization has stated that Trump is not connected with the liquor licenses, New Jersey attorney general pointed out that Trump is the sole beneficiary of his revocable trust, which owns the licenses.[555][558] A hearing for the licenses was expected to be held on July 19, but was delayed until September until after Trump's sentencing.[559][555] Trump has a right to one level of appeal for the conviction itself, which he is expected to use.[560][462] The appeal would be heard by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, which is the intermediate state appellate court covering Manhattan and the Bronx. If unsuccessful, the next step would be the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, which has discretion whether to hear an appeal.[561] In July 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a lawsuit against New York State in an attempt to invoke the Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes between two states.[562] The lawsuit sought to block Trump's gag order and sentencing until after the November election, accusing New York of interfering with the presidential election in Missouri and violating Missourians' First Amendment rights.[562] On August 5, the Supreme Court ruled against intervening in the case.[563]","""Has the son of the prosecutor in Donald J.

"""With Prisoner Swap, Biden Loses a Loss as His Term Nears Its End.The exchange Offered a Measure of Disappointment for President Biden Soon After He Embraced His Bid for Re-election.""","With Prisoner Swap, Biden Scores a Win as His Term Nears Its End  ADVERTISEMENT  WHITE HOUSE MEMO The exchange offered a measure of validation for President Biden soon after he abandoned his bid for re-election. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Peter Baker Peter Baker covers the White House and previously spent four years reporting from Moscow. Even in the world of presidential multitasking, July 21 turns out to have been an extraordinary, whipsaw Sunday for President Biden. At 12:09 p.m., he picked up the phone at his vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., to talk with the prime minister of Slovenia as part of a high-stakes diplomatic gamble to seal a complicated, multinational prisoner swap. Just 97 minutes later, he posted a world-stunning letter online abandoning his bid for re-election after a bruising pressure campaign by his own Democratic allies, climaxing the biggest crisis of his political career and signaling the end of his presidency after a half-century in public life. By any measure, it was one of the darkest moments of his time in elective office as the inescapable reality of time, age and polls finally caught up with him. And yet it would lead to one of the most joyous days of his presidency barely a week and a half later as he orchestrated the release of imprisoned Americans from the dungeons of Russia. ADVERTISEMENT For Mr. Biden and his team, the successful negotiation to free 16 people held by Russia on Thursday, including three American citizens and a U.S. permanent resident, offered sweet validation even as the clock is now ticking toward his final curtain call in office. When the president appeared with relatives of the liberated prisoners in the State Dining Room of the White House, it was clearly personal to him and he framed it as a mission on behalf of the larger American family. “My dad had a simple proposition: Family is the beginning, the middle and the end. Blood of my blood and bone of my bone,” Mr. Biden said before hugging the daughter of one of the freed prisoners. “I could think of nothing more consequential.” As he often does, he drew on his own experience of personal tragedy. “Having lost family,” albeit in a very different way, he said that bringing home these tortured souls now, well, “it matters, it matters.” It clearly mattered to him too. Although he made no mention of the incredible timing of his diplomatic triumph, just an hour and a half before his political surrender, it reinforced a commitment to making his last five months in power count. He may be a lame duck now, but he has no intention of heading off quietly into the night — except his trip late Thursday to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, where he welcomed home the Americans. Mr. Biden’s staff made a point of talking up his diplomatic deftness in brokering the deal, bringing together seven countries in the largest such swap since the Cold War. And they emphasized that he and his administration had helped free more than 70 Americans wrongfully detained abroad during his tenure. ADVERTISEMENT “This was vintage Joe Biden,” said Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. “If you had not had Joe Biden sitting in the Oval Office, I don’t think this would have happened.” Mr. Sullivan, who has been personally invested in bringing home the hostages for years and had to deliver bad news to their families on many occasions, grew teary-eyed himself in the White House briefing room. “Today was a very good day,” he said, choking up. It was Mr. Sullivan who set up the president’s critical call with Prime Minister Robert Golob of Slovenia on July 21, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share behind-the-scenes details. The day before, on Saturday, July 20, Mr. Sullivan had been in Colorado for a meeting of the Aspen Strategy Group and worked the phones to bring together the deal. He was talking with his counterpart from Slovenia, which had agreed in principle to release two Russians held by that Balkan country as part of the swap to free the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and the others held by Moscow.

But the two Russians would have to be pardoned, and the Slovenians said they could not do that in time, according to the U.S. official. So Mr. Sullivan asked if he could arrange a call from the president to the prime minister. After flying back to Washington, Mr. Sullivan called from his home that Sunday and connected the two leaders through the White House Situation Room, according to the U.S. official. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Biden was in isolation in Rehoboth recovering from Covid — and unknown to nearly the whole world, finalizing his letter withdrawing from the race. Even Mr. Sullivan, one of Mr. Biden’s closest advisers, had no idea what the president was about to do when he patched through the call and only learned later — and not from the president. During the phone call, which lasted just a few minutes, Mr. Biden implored Mr. Golob to facilitate the release of the two Russians in his custody. In making his pitch, Mr. Biden even offered to visit Slovenia, the U.S. official said. What Mr. Biden did not say was that he would only have a few months left in office to follow up on that idea. Mr. Sullivan, asked about the timing of the call shortly before the withdrawal, said it was simply happenstance. “That’s when the pieces were falling in place,” he said. It was hardly the only conversation Mr. Biden had during the months of haggling. He reached out personally to other foreign leaders, most critically Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, who for a long time had resisted releasing Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin convicted of murdering a Chechen separatist in Germany on state orders. ADVERTISEMENT But with Mr. Biden pressing him, and the prospect of winning the release of Aleksei Navalny, the most prominent Russian opposition leader who was in prison, Mr. Scholz finally relented. “For you, I will do this,” he told Mr. Biden in January, according to U.S. officials. Mr. Navalny died in prison a few weeks later, temporarily sabotaging the deal. But Mr. Scholz still went along with releasing Mr. Krasikov in the end and got five German nationals imprisoned in Russia in trade. “The deal that made this possible was a feat of diplomacy and friendship — friendship,” Mr. Biden said on Thursday. In a veiled reference to former President Donald J. Trump, who constantly berates and belittles America’s European partners, Mr. Biden added: “For anyone who questions whether allies matter, they do. They matter.” No longer facing another election might have made it easier on some level for Mr. Biden to risk whatever political fallout there might be for the swap. It was an uncomfortable compromise. No one liked giving up a killer like Mr. Krasikov for innocent Americans like Mr. Gershkovich, the Marine veteran Paul Whelan and the journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, along with Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian opposition leader and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Washington Post who is a permanent U.S. resident. ADVERTISEMENT Trading for hostages always raises the tricky question of whether it encourages the hostage-takers to do it again. Unsurprisingly, Republicans quickly made that point, most loudly Mr. Trump, who is seeking his old job back and denounced giving anything away to free American prisoners. “To do so is bad precedent for the future,” Mr. Trump wrote on his social media site in a posting that did not even pause to celebrate the freedom for the Americans and others released. “That’s the way it should be, or this situation will get worse and worse. They are extorting the United States of America.” But in fact, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sullivan decided early in his administration that the old politics no longer applied and that they should be willing to make trades, when justified, to free imprisoned Americans. For all the predictable criticism that would come, they concluded that there was really no meaningful domestic political cost, nor was it clear that refusing to make deals would necessarily stop hostage taking. In that case, they reasoned that it was better just to get Americans home rather than stand on what they considered a pointless principle and leave innocent people wasting away in foreign prisons or terrorist sanctuaries. They did so for Trevor R. Reed, an ailing former U.S. Marine held in Russia on what his family called bogus charges of assault, and they did so again for Brittney Griner, the W.N.B.A. star arrested in Moscow on what U.S. officials considered trumped-up drug charges. Left out of all those deals, though, was Marc Fogel, an American teacher sentenced to 14 years in a labor camp after being found with medical marijuana. Biden aides said they would keep trying to free him too. ADVERTISEMENT When Mr. Biden appeared on Thursday with the families of Mr. Gershkovich and the others, he laughed off a claim by Mr. Trump that if he were elected again, he would get President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to simply free American prisoners without receiving anything in return. “Why didn’t he do it when he was president?” Mr. Biden asked. With that, he headed out of the room. There was more to do. In fact, he had another important phone call to make, this one with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. There were, after all, more crises to confront, more hostages to try to free and not much time left. Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.

" The Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller investigated whether a Trump adviser was part of an Egyptian plan, proven, to funnel $10 million to the 2016 Trump campaign.","Alongside the Trump-Russia Inquiry, a Lesser-Known Look at Egyptian Influence  Trump’s Legal Troubles ADVERTISEMENT  The Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller investigated whether a Trump adviser was part of an Egyptian plan, never proven, to funnel $10 million to the 2016 Trump campaign. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Michael S. SchmidtAdam Goldman and Glenn Thrush In the summer of 2017, as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was starting his investigation, his agents and prosecutors were chasing potentially explosive allegations about foreign influence over Donald J. Trump and his campaign. C.I.A. intelligence relayed to the special counsel’s office suggested that senior leaders of a foreign power had signed off on secretly funneling millions of dollars — with the help of a Trump campaign adviser acting as “a bag man” — to Mr. Trump in the final days of the 2016 election. Interviews and other evidence obtained by the special counsel’s office showed that indeed Mr. Trump had lent his campaign a similar amount of money in the final days of the race — and, after beating Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump immediately struck a far more favorable tone toward the country than his predecessors. The country in question, however, was not Russia. It was Egypt. Seven years after Mr. Mueller’s team dug in on those allegations, people familiar with the investigation acknowledged that while much of the country’s attention was focused on ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, the most concrete lead Mr. Mueller’s team initially had about potential foreign influence over Mr. Trump involved Egypt. The people familiar with the inquiry discussed details of it on the condition of anonymity. ADVERTISEMENT While Mr. Mueller has often been criticized for not moving aggressively enough to investigate Mr. Trump’s personal and financial ties to Russia, his team took invasive steps to try to understand whether Mr. Trump or his campaign had received financial backing from Cairo. Mr. Trump’s foreign business ties and efforts by foreign interests and government to influence him have come under scrutiny again as he seeks to return to the White House. The little-known investigation into possible Egyptian influence shows both the intensity of past efforts to explore the issue and how they have fueled Mr. Trump’s long-running assertions that he has been subject to a “witch hunt.” Case Tracker: Trump is facing multiple criminal cases related to his business and political activities.

The Egypt investigation would outlast Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, which shut down in 2019. It was picked up by career prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, who closed it out in the summer of 2020 without pursuing any charges. No evidence has ever surfaced publicly that Mr. Trump or his campaign directly received Egyptian money. Details about the depth and breadth of the investigation have trickled out over the years. CNN laid out major elements of the investigation in October 2020, including that there was a secret legal fight between the Justice Department and an Egyptian bank. Investigators at the time were seeking bank records related to the matter, which ultimately ended up — under seal — being appealed to the Supreme Court. The Washington Post on Friday disclosed further details, reporting that five days before Mr. Trump took office in 2017 an organization linked to Egyptian intelligence withdrew $10 million in cash from a bank in Cairo — the same amount that the C.I.A. had been told was given to Mr. Trump in the final days of his campaign. The report about the withdrawal was confirmed to The New York Times by a person briefed on the investigation. ADVERTISEMENT The investigation started in the days after the 2016 election when the C.I.A. learned from a trusted confidential source that senior Egyptian leaders — including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi — had signed off on sending $10 million to Mr. Trump’s cash strapped campaign. The Egyptian leaders, investigators would be told, had in mind someone in Mr. Trump’s orbit to move the money: a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser named Walid Phares, who had frequently appeared on Fox News. Our politics reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. That includes participating in rallies and donating money to a candidate or cause. The F.B.I. opened an investigation into Mr. Phares, with investigators trying to understand whether he was “a bag man.” Mr. Trump’s first C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, was briefed on the details of the agency’s intelligence. In May 2017, Mr. Mueller was appointed special counsel after questions were raised about Mr. Trump’s attempts to interfere in F.B.I. investigations into his ties to Russia. Mr. Mueller was given a mandate to investigate Russia’s effort to influence the 2016 election and ties that four Trump campaign advisers had to Russia. What the public did not know at the time was that Mr. Mueller had also been given the job of investigating Mr. Phares and the intelligence suggesting that Egypt had sought to funnel money to Mr. Trump. ADVERTISEMENT Throughout the investigation, Mr. Mueller’s team was confronted with a range of allegations about Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. But, in the eyes of some agents and prosecutors working on Mr. Mueller’s team, the intelligence about Egypt was far firmer than anything they had related to Mr. Trump and Russia. At the time, Mr. Trump was threatening to fire Mr. Mueller, drawing a red line around his personal finances. But the evidence about Egypt allowed agents and prosecutors to convince Mr. Mueller to subpoena Mr. Trump’s bank records from the period of time during the campaign and just after the election that he might have received the money. The records were not helpful in corroborating the allegations, the people familiar with the investigation said. Some investigators wanted to continue digging, but Mr. Mueller stopped short of seeking the records from when Mr. Trump took office, leaving some investigators disappointed. Mr. Mueller’s investigators did devote significant resources to looking at Mr. Phares, who had told Trump campaign advisers that he could broker meetings between the Egyptian government and the campaign. Mr. Phares also took credit for arranging a September 2016 meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. el-Sisi, which investigators later examined. ADVERTISEMENT American intelligence agencies had learned what agents and analysts thought was potentially corroborating evidence: that there were questions atop the Egyptian government whether Mr. Phares could be trusted to deliver the money. The F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Phares on multiple occasions, learning new details such as his contacts with Egyptian intelligence officials. But despite Mr. Phares initial cooperation with the investigators, he eventually hired a lawyer and stopped talking. By 2019, Mr. Mueller’s team thought it had taken the investigation as far as it could. When Mr. Mueller’s Russia inquiry wound down, he referred the still-open Egyptian case to Justice Department prosecutors, who picked up where he left off. It was around that same time that U.S. officials learned of the $10 million bank withdrawal in Cairo by the group linked to Egyptian intelligence agencies, sparking more suspicions among investigators. In June 2020, The Times reported that the F.B.I. and special counsel’s office had investigated whether Mr. Phares had secretly worked for the Egyptian government to try to influence the incoming Trump administration. Mr. Phares declined to comment at the time and could not be reached on Friday. But that summer, prosecutors decided they had hit a wall and closed out the case. Michael S.

Hunter Biden has been convicted of all three felony charges related to the purchase of a revolver in 2018 when, prosecutors argued, the president’s son lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.                    WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Hunter Biden was convicted Tuesday of all three felony charges related to the purchase of a revolver in 2018 when, prosecutors argued, the president’s son lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. Hunter Biden, 54, stared straight ahead and showed little emotion as the verdict was read after jury deliberations that lasted only three hours over two days in Wilmington, Delaware. He hugged his attorneys, smiled wanly and kissed his wife, Melissa, before leaving the courtroom with her. President Joe Biden said in a statement issued shortly after the verdict that he would accept the outcome and “continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.” What to know about Hunter Biden’s conviction: Now Hunter Biden and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the president’s chief political rival, have both been convicted by American jurors in an election year that has been as much about the courtroom as about campaign events and rallies. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports jurors in Hunter Biden’s federal gun trial find him guilty. Hunter Biden, right, departs from federal court, Monday, June 10, 2024, in Wilmington, Del. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, though as a first-time offender he would not get anywhere near the maximum, and there’s no guarantee the judge would send him to prison. She did not set a sentencing date. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell said they would “continue to vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available.” In a written statement, Hunter Biden said he was disappointed by the outcome but grateful for the support of family and friends.  The jury’s decision was read swiftly after the announcement that it reached a verdict. First lady Jill Biden sat through nearly every day of the trial but did not make it into the courtroom in time to hear the verdict. Hunter Biden walked out of the courthouse holding hands with the first lady and his wife before they got into waiting SUVs and drove off. Joe Biden steered clear of the federal courtroom where his son was tried and said little about the case, wary of appearing to interfere in a criminal matter brought by his own Justice Department. But allies of the Democrat have worried about the toll that the trial — and now the conviction — will take on the 81-year-old, who has long been concerned with his only living son’s health and sustained sobriety. Hunter Biden’s conviction came just weeks after Trump was found guilty of 34 felony charges related to a hush money payment to a porn actor in the 2016 campaign. The cases are in no way the same, and Hunter Biden is a private citizen who is not running for office. But they have both argued they were victimized by the politics of the moment. Trump, however, has continued to falsely claim his verdict was “rigged,” while Joe Biden has said he would accept the verdict involving his son and would not seek to pardon him. In his statement Tuesday, the president said he and the first lady are proud of their son, who says he has been sober since 2019, and will always be there for him with “love and support.” Trump’s campaign called the verdict “nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family.” Trump and his allies have pressed unsubstantiated or debunked allegations that Joe Biden acted while vice president to advance his family members’ foreign business interests. The verdict came down as the president prepared to give a speech at a conference hosted by the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund in Washington. He did not mention his son as he spoke about his administration’s efforts to stop gun violence and the need to ban so-called assault weapons. Hours after the conviction, President Biden hugged his son after landing in Wilmington to spend the night with family before leaving Wednesday for the Group of Seven leaders conference in Italy. Hunter Biden, his wife and their child greeted the president on the tarmac, and the president lingered to visit with them for several minutes. Jurors found Hunter Biden guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days. The trial played out in the president’s home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington, and his other son, Beau Biden, was the state attorney general before he died of cancer. The proceedings put a spotlight on a dark time in Hunter Biden’s life, including his spiraling descent after Beau’s death in 2015. The trial featured deeply personal testimony from former romantic partners and embarrassing evidence such as text messages and photos of Hunter Biden with drug paraphernalia or partially clothed. In his closing argument on Monday, prosecutor Leo Wise acknowledged the evidence was “ugly.” But he told jurors it was also “absolutely necessary” to prove Hunter was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied when he checked “no” on the form that asked whether he was “an unlawful user of, or addicted to” drugs. Before the case went to the jury, the prosecutor urged jurors to pay no mind to members of the president’s family sitting in the courtroom, telling them: “People sitting in the gallery are not evidence.” Hunter Biden arrives to federal court with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, Tuesday, June 11, 2024, in Wilmington, Del. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) David Weiss, the prosecutor who has led the long-running investigation into the president’s son, told reporters the case was about Hunter Biden’s “illegal choices” and “dangerous” conduct. “No one in this country is above the law,” said Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney for Delaware, who was named special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in August. “Everyone must be accountable for their actions.” Hunter Biden’s lawyers had argued that he did not consider himself an “addict” when he bought the gun. They sought to show he was trying to turn his life around at the time, having completed a rehabilitation program at the end of August 2018. Hunter Biden’s legal troubles aren’t over. He faces a trial in September in California on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes, and congressional Republicans have signaled they will keep going after him in their stalled impeachment effort into the president. The president has not been accused or charged with any wrongdoing by prosecutors investigating his son. Just last year, it appeared that Hunter Biden would avoid the spectacle of a trial so close to the election. Under a deal with prosecutors, he was supposed to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and avoid prosecution in the gun case if he stayed out of trouble for two years. But the deal fell apart after Noreika, who was nominated by Trump, questioned unusual aspects of the proposed agreement, and the lawyers could not resolve the matter. Hunter Biden has said he was charged because the Justice Department bowed to pressure from Republicans who argued the Democratic president’s son was getting special treatment.

"""Trump rally shooter's roof was unmonitored by Secret Service, claims acting director""","Rooftop where gunman shot at Trump was identified as a security vulnerability before rally: sources          The rooftop where a gunman shot at former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally was identified by the Secret Service as a potential vulnerability in the days before the event, two sources familiar with the agency’s operations told NBC News. The building, owned by a glass research company, is adjacent to the Butler Farm Show, an outdoor venue in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service was aware of the risks associated with it, the sources said. “Someone should have been on the roof or securing the building so no one could get on the roof,” said one of the sources, a former senior Secret Service agent who was familiar with the planning.  Understanding how the gunman got onto the roof — despite those concerns — is a central question for investigators scrutinizing how a lone attacker managed to shoot at Trump during Saturday’s campaign event. The Secret Service worked with local law enforcement to maintain event security, including sniper teams poised on rooftops to identify and eliminate threats, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. But no officers were posted on the building used by the would-be assassin, outside the event’s security perimeter but only about 148 yards from the stage — within range of a semiautomatic rifle like the one the gunman was carrying. The Secret Service had designated that rooftop as being under the jurisdiction of local law enforcement, a common practice in securing outdoor rallies, Guglielmi said.Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger said his office maintains an Emergency Services Unit team, which deployed four sniper teams and four “quick response teams” at the rally. But he said the Secret Service agents were in charge of security outside the venue.  “They had meetings in the week prior. The Secret Service ran the show. They were the ones who designated who did what,” Goldinger said. “In the command hierarchy, they were top, they were No. 1.” Goldinger said the commander of the Emergency Services Unit told him it was not responsible for securing areas outside the venue. “To me, the whole thing is under the jurisdiction of the Secret Service. And they will delineate from there,” he said. The former senior Secret Service agent also said that even if local law enforcement “did drop the ball,” it’s still the agency’s responsibility “to ensure that they are following through either beforehand or in the moment.” “Just because it is outside of the perimeter, it doesn’t take it out of play for a vulnerability, and you’ve got to mitigate it in some fashion,” the source added. A volley of shots rang out minutes into Trump’s speech. He reached for his right ear — he said later it was pierced by a bullet — then dropped to the ground as Secret Service agents rushed to shield him. Trump emerged with blood on his ear and his face. One attendee was killed, and two others were injured.Witnesses listening to Trump’s speech from outside the event’s security perimeter recalled pointing out the gunman to law enforcement a couple of minutes before the shooting began. After the gunfire started, Secret Service personnel shot and killed the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks. The clamor over the Secret Service’s biggest failure since the shooting of President Ronald Reagan in 1981 is coming from both political parties, from former agents and from security experts. “My question is: How did he get onto that roof undetected?” said Anthony Cangelosi, a former Secret Service agent who worked on protective details for presidential candidates, including John Kerry in 2004. The Secret Service’s work on campaign events like Saturday’s begins with advance planning, setting up a security perimeter and positioning teams on the ground and on rooftops — often in partnership with local law enforcement. The ground deployments include a counterassault team, and the rooftop personnel include counter-sniper teams. Guglielmi, the Secret Service spokesman, said the agency had two of its counterassault agents at the event and filled out the rest of the platoon with at least six officers from Butler County tactical units. The Secret Service also deployed two counter-sniper teams. Two other security units needed for the event were staffed by local law enforcement agencies, Guglielmi said. Those details were first reported by The Washington Post.Investigators will want to examine the Secret Service’s site security plan for the rally, said Cangelosi, the former Secret Service agent. He expects they’ll discover one of two things: Either officials failed to make an effective plan for keeping potential shooters off the building Crooks fired from, or officers on the ground failed to execute the plan. “I don’t like making any assumptions, but it does look like some mistakes were made, that this was preventable,” said Cangelosi, now a lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Although it’s common to task local law enforcement agencies with patrolling outside an event’s security perimeter, Cangelosi said, the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that all vulnerabilities are covered rests with the Secret Service. If officials had placed an officer on the building where the gunman fired from, Cangelosi said, chances are he “wouldn’t even attempt what he attempted.” “You don’t surrender the discretion of what’s supposed to be done to the local police,” he said. “In other words, you guys have the outer perimeter, but you would want to say, ‘We need an officer on that roof.’ Not ‘that’s your responsibility; do what you see fit.’” Jim Cavanaugh, a retired special agent in charge with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who has worked on Secret Service details, told NBC News that while the Secret Service did a good job taking out the gunman after shots began, the failure to post officers on the building he scaled was “a tremendous lapse.” “The only way to stop that is you have a lot of people, you get there first, and you command the high ground,” Cavanaugh said. “This is basic, and the Secret Service has done it for years successfully, so I’m really surprised that they did not have that high ground covered.” The questions extended to Congress, where members demanded answers from the Secret Service and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security.“This raises serious concerns regarding how a shooter was able to access a rooftop within range and direct line of sight of where President Trump was speaking,” House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Green asked Mayorkas to provide documentation relating to the event’s security plan, the screening of attendees and the level of resources provided to Trump’s Secret Service detail. A committee spokesperson told NBC News that Republican members would hold a briefing with Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Monday “to voice their concerns and ask pressing questions.” Another lawmaker, Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., wrote Cheatle asking who approved the security plan, whether a proper threat assessment was conducted, whether attendees raised alarms and whether there were failures in following protocols that allowed the attack to happen. “I call on all those responsible for the planning, approving, and executing of this failed security plan to be held accountable and to testify before Congress immediately,” Gallego wrote in a letter to Cheatle. Robert McDonald, a former Secret Service agent who ran protection for Joe Biden when he was vice president, told NBC News that he believes the assassination attempt will prompt soul-searching and procedural changes at the agency. “The Secret Service is going to need to ask some hard questions of itself here and be prepared to stand up and represent why, what happened,” McDonald said. Cangelosi, the former Secret Service agent, said investigators are also likely to ask when agents identified Crooks as a potential threat, how they reacted and whether it’s possible they could have taken him down before he fired at Trump.Secret Service snipers are trained to make rapid decisions, he said. But it’s possible that if they noticed Crooks on the roof but couldn’t tell whether he had a rifle, agents might have waited to fire on him. “If the sniper can’t tell whether he has a gun, he or she is not going to take the shot,” Cangelosi said. “Because God forbid it’s a child who’s just excited to see a political candidate, right? So you want to make sure that there’s actually a threat.” If there was uncertainty, Cangelosi said, it’s possible the sniper team would have dispatched officers to investigate and confirm. But investigating a potential threat can take minutes, he said, while a gunman with a semiautomatic rifle can fire several shots in a matter of seconds. That’s why, Cangelosi said, the best defense would have been to plan ahead to keep the shooter off the roof in the first place. “Who wants to be in that position?” he said of the snipers protecting Trump on Saturday. “You’ve got to make a split-second call. And imagine if you’re wrong.” Sarah Fitzpatrick is a senior investigative producer and story editor for NBC News. She previously worked for CBS News and ""60 Minutes.""

Judge Chutkan might not be able to restart the Trump election interference case anymore since it's no longer in her jurisdiction.,"Trump’s Federal Election Case to Go Back Before a No-Nonsense Judge  Trump Federal Election Case ADVERTISEMENT  If her record is any guide, Judge Tanya Chutkan will try to keep pretrial proceedings moving along after a lengthy hiatus and the Supreme Court’s decision granting former presidents broad immunity. NEW Listen to articles Tap the Play button at the top of any article to hear it read aloud. By Alan Feuer Alan Feuer has reported on the federal criminal investigations into former President Donald J. Trump since their inception. Judge Tanya S. Chutkan wasted no time last month when the biggest case of her career — the indictment of former President Donald J. Trump on election interference charges — was handed back to her. After watching from the sidelines for nearly eight months as Mr. Trump’s lawyers fought their way up to the Supreme Court with what turned out to be a largely successful argument that he had broad immunity from prosecution on charges arising from his official acts as president, Judge Chutkan moved quickly to get pretrial proceedings moving again. Within 24 hours of getting the matter back, she laid out a schedule for discussing the impact of the court’s immunity ruling on the case. Working on a Saturday in August, she also found time to tidy up her desk and deny two separate motions by Mr. Trump’s lawyers that the appellate process had forbidden her to touch for nearly a year. On Thursday, Judge Chutkan is set to preside over a hearing in Federal District Court in Washington where she is likely to explain how she intends to approach the task of figuring out which parts of Mr. Trump’s indictment will have to be tossed out under the immunity ruling and which can survive and go to trial. ADVERTISEMENT Her ultimate decision will not only shape the future of the case, but will also serve as a test of the no-nonsense style that she has brought to bear on it since the day it was assigned to her last August. Before Mr. Trump’s immunity appeals put the case in limbo, Judge Chutkan, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, oversaw it with a stern hand and an expeditious manner. She often worked through the weekends and evinced little patience for the persistent strategy by Mr. Trump and his legal team of seeking to delay the case at every turn.

Not long after the indictment was returned, she set the tone for how she planned to handle the matter by telling Mr. Trump that when he was in her courtroom, she planned to look on him as a criminal defendant, not a former president. As for the fact that he was running for office again, that, she said somewhat dismissively, was his “day job.” In all of this, she distinguished herself from a colleague in Florida, Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who recently threw out Mr. Trump’s other federal case — in which he stood accused of mishandling classified documents — on the grounds that Jack Smith, the special counsel who filed both prosecutions, had been improperly appointed to his job. The ruling by Judge Cannon, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, flew in the face of both a quarter-century of Justice Department practice and previous court decisions reaching back to the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s. It also capped a series of unusual rulings and procedural moves that were so outside the norm that many legal experts called for Mr. Smith to seek her removal. ADVERTISEMENT The fate of the federal election case, in which Mr. Trump is charged with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, rests in part on decisions that will be made outside of Judge Chutkan’s courtroom. If voters return Mr. Trump to office, he is all but certain to direct his Justice Department to kill the case or at least delay it until the end of his term. And even if he loses in November, the case will face further legal hurdles, including likely further review by the Supreme Court of any decisions made by Judge Chutkan about how much of the indictment can survive the immunity ruling.

The hearing on Thursday will be largely procedural in nature. Mr. Trump is not expected to attend, and will leave it to his lawyers to formally enter a plea of not guilty to a revised version of the indictment that Mr. Smith filed last week to address the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, according to a court filing on Tuesday. Judge Chutkan is expected to consider — and may hand down a ruling on — the dueling proposals filed last week by the defense and prosecution about how they would like to address the question of applying the immunity decision to the charges accusing Mr. Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. Mr. Smith’s deputies, in their proposal, said they believed that the Supreme Court’s ruling simply “does not apply” to the charges in the case, which they recently retooled to home in, as they put it, on Mr. Trump’s “private electioneering activity,” not on his official acts as president. ADVERTISEMENT The prosecutors told Judge Chutkan that they were ready to get to work whenever she was, saying they could send her court papers explaining their position “promptly at any time the court deems appropriate.” Mr. Trump’s lawyers had a very different view on how to proceed, saying that even the newly fashioned charges could not survive the ruling on immunity. Moreover, they informed Judge Chutkan that they planned to attack the case on legal fronts that go well beyond the issue of immunity, suggesting a schedule for additional briefings and hearings that reach into the fall of next year. How Judge Chutkan handles these competing plans will determine how long it could take to have a trial-ready indictment in place and how much new evidence about Mr. Trump’s plots to stay in power could be revealed by the process of designing one. Mr. Smith’s team has suggested, for example, that it would like to include in its filing at least some evidence that was not in the indictment. But Judge Chutkan may have something to say about whether that evidence should be made public or whether it is submitted under seal. Mr. Trump’s lawyers are likely to raise different concerns and can be expected to ask Judge Chutkan for permission to file a new motion to dismiss the case even before the two sides open the debate about how the Supreme Court’s immunity decision will affect it. ADVERTISEMENT The lawyers have already said they would like to push back any detailed discussion of immunity until at least December, well after the election. They have also said they would like to file a motion attacking Mr. Smith’s appointment, similar to the one that led to the dismissal of the classified documents case. While it remains unclear how Judge Chutkan will decide these issues, if her previous appearances on the bench in the election case are any measure, she is unlikely to look favorably on efforts to unnecessarily complicate or delay it. The last time she oversaw a hearing in the matter was in October of last year, when she imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump, barring him from attacking some witnesses, court staff and prosecutors involved in the proceeding. At that hearing, she kept things moving forward, brooked no nonsense from Mr. Trump’s lawyers and treated the former president like any other criminal defendant. At one point, John Lauro, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, objected to her that the trial date she had picked — then set for early March — was only a day before Mr. Trump was to compete in the Republican primary elections on Super Tuesday. Judge Chutkan was not interested in Mr. Lauro’s complaints. “This trial will not yield to the election cycle,” she told him, “and we’re not revisiting the trial date.” Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.

So naturally, plenty of people are reacquainting themselves with Harris and her background. A multicultural upbringing greatly inspired Harris, including her religious beliefs. Here’s what you need to know about the VP’s faith. Harris said in an interview with Interfaith Youth Core that her “faith journey” started when she was young. “On Sundays, my mother would dress my sister, Maya, and me in our Sunday best and send us off to the 23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland, California, where Maya and I sang in the children’s choir,” Harris told the publication. “That’s where I formed some of my earliest memories of the Bible’s teachings. It’s where I learned that ‘faith’ is a verb and that we must live it, and show it, in action.” Harris’ mother was Hindu, and her father was Christian. She grew up attending services at a Black Baptist church and a Hindu temple, USA Today reported. Harris met husband Doug Emhoff on a blind date in 2013, and the couple tied the knot a year later. She is a stepmother to Emhoff’s two children from a prior relationship, son Cole and daughter Ella. According to America Magazine, the couple smashed a glass as part of the traditional Jewish custom at their wedding. Harris told Interfaith Youth Core that she shares “Jewish traditions and celebrations” with Emhoff at home. “From all of these traditions and teachings, I’ve learned that faith is not only something we express in church and prayerful reflection, but also in the way we live our lives, do our work and pursue our respective callings,” she said. Prior to becoming Vice President, Harris represented California in the U.S. Senate starting in January 2017. During her 2020 campaign, rumors began circulating that Harris had refused to be sworn in to the Senate on a Bible, but that’s inaccurate. She used a family Bible for the occasion, noting that it was “well-worn,” per USA Today. “All right, that’s a good way to do it,” then-Vice President Biden said. In August 2019, Harris used parallels between what she hoped to achieve in politics and her faith. “Jesus tells us how we should define neighbor,” she said during a speech. “Jesus tells us, your neighbor is not just the person who lives next door, who drives the kind of car you drive, the person shares your zip code. Jesus tells us your neighbor is that man by the side of the road who you walk by, who has faced hardship.” Harris’ beliefs have also influenced her position regarding women’s reproductive rights. In July 2022, she held a roundtable meeting with faith leaders in Los Angeles to discuss the importance that “health care decisions are made by women without government interference, and the need to work together as a coalition to safeguard this right.” Prior to her election in 2020, Harris’ base church was the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco. The church’s pastor, Rev. Amos Brown, told the Associated Press that Harris is a “spiritual person” and “quintessential scholar.” Harris told Interfaith Youth Core that church has been a place where she “draws strength” and reflects. “I also draw something else from it as well: a sense of community and belonging where we can build lasting relationships and be there for one another in times of need,” she said.

"""There was excitement. Now, there’s none: How Harris’ candidacy has demoralized plans for the DNC""","Who has endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 Democratic nomination, and who hasn't yet?  Watch CBS News By Emily Mae Czachor Updated on: July 26, 2024 / 6:06 AM EDT / CBS News Leading Democrats are voicing their support for Vice President Kamala Harris as their party seeks a nominee to replace President Biden in the 2024 race, now that he has taken himself out of the running.  Mr. Biden endorsed Harris after announcing his decision to drop out, but he cannot personally appoint a Democratic nominee to fill his spot in the presidential race. Whoever is ultimately chosen will be determined through a vote by the delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which was set to happen virtually in early August. The convention begins Aug. 19.   ""My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,"" Mr. Biden said a social media post. ""And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this."" Former President Barack Obama endorsed Harris on Friday, calling her a ""happy warrior"" and vowing to do all he can to help her defeat former President Donald Trump in November. In a video posted by her campaign, Harris takes a call from Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama.  ""We called to say Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,"" Obama tells Harris over the phone.  Michelle Obama tells Harris, ""I am proud of you. This is going to be historic."" Another high-profile endorsement came the day after Biden withdrew, as Rep. Nancy Pelosi, former speaker of the House, threw her support behind the vice president, a fellow Californian. Pelosi had initially said she favored an open process. ""My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for President is official, personal and political,"" she said in a statement Monday, July 22. ""Officially, I have seen Kamala Harris's strength and courage as a champion for working families, notably fighting for a woman's right to choose. Personally, I have known Kamala Harris for decades as rooted in strong values, faith and a commitment to public service. Politically, make no mistake: Kamala Harris as a woman in politics is brilliantly astute — and I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory in November."" The major Democratic leaders in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, announced their endorsement at a news conference Tuesday afternoon, with Schumer saying they'd held off for a few days to give Harris a chance to build support ""from the grassroots."" ""Vice President Harris has done a truly impressive job securing the majority of delegates needed to win the Democratic Party's nomination,"" Schumer said. ""...Democrats are moving forward stronger and more united than ever before."" Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were among the pool of politicians to endorse Harris in the hours after Mr. Biden's announcement. ""We join millions of Americans in thanking President Biden for all he has accomplished, standing up for America time and again, with his North Star always being what's best for the country. We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,"" the Clintons said in a joint statement.  ""We've lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term. He has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile Supreme Court will only embolden him to further shred the Constitution,"" their statement continued. ""Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we've got to elect her. America's future depends on it."" Statement from President Clinton and Secretary Clinton pic.twitter.com/R7tYMFWbsu Hillary Clinton added an individual endorsement for Harris, saying on social media, ""I've known Kamala Harris a long time. This brilliant prosecutor will make the case against convicted felon Donald Trump and the Project 2025 agenda to take away our freedoms."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who ran a presidential campaign of her own in 2020, also issued a statement backing Harris as the party's potential nominee this year. ""I endorse Kamala Harris for President,"" Warren's statement read. ""She is a proven fighter who has been a national leader in safeguarding consumers and protecting access to abortion. As a former prosecutor, she can press a forceful case against allowing Donald Trump to regain the White House. We have many talented people in our party, but Vice President Harris is the person who was chosen by the voters to succeed Joe Biden if needed. She can unite our party, take on Donald Trump, and win in November."" Mr. Biden's decision to end his campaign followed weeks of turmoil within the Democratic Party over whether he would be able to win reelection and serve another term, since his disastrous performance at the presidential debate in June opposite his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump.  Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a close Biden ally, wrote, ""I echo the good judgment he demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party's 2024 nominee for President."" Many other endorsements came quickly. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose name was sometimes floated as a potential candidate himself, threw his support behind Harris. ""Tough. Fearless. Tenacious. With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump's dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America's Vice President, @KamalaHarris,"" Newsom posted on social media. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who ran in the 2020 primaries, posted on X, ""I will do all that I can to help elect @KamalaHarris the next President of the United States."" Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, whose name has been mentioned as a potential running mate for Harris, offered his full-throated endorsement for Harris on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Monday. ""[Biden's] decision, I know was hard, but it's going to secure his legacy that I believe historians are going to say, was a great presidency. With that I'm excited to fully endorse Vice President Harris ... for the next president of the United States. The vice president is smart and strong, which will make her a good president."" Another person whose name has been discussed as a potential Harris running mate added his voice to the growing chorus endorsing the vice president: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who called her ""our party's best chance to defeat Donald Trump in November."" ""It's important to be thoughtful about what's next for the Democratic Party and for the country, which is why I spent hours yesterday talking to fellow leaders in our Party getting and giving input about the road to victory in November. I am also cognizant of the unique role we play here in Illinois as hosts of the Democratic National Convention,"" he said. ""Vice President Harris has proven, at every point in her career, that she possesses the skills, strength, and character to lead this country and the vision to better the lives of all Americans."" In the wake of Beshear's and Pritzker's endorsements, the Kentucky Democratic convention delegation and the Illinois Democratic Party also threw their support behind the vice president. And Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who had initially been discussed as a possible Democratic presidential nominee, came out in support of Harris, saying,""Let's win this."" Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, as well as battleground state Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, have also endorsed Harris.  Klobuchar, who ran against Biden and Harris in the 2020 primaries, told CBS News, ""She's an incredibly strong leader who will bring to this office, and to this campaign, the receipts. ... She is someone that knows the work, knows the job. And I also know her as a good person."" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, tweeted her support, writing: ""Vice President @KamalaHarris just called me and I told her I am 1000% in for her to be our President! She has the smarts, the experience, the accomplishments and the agenda to lead us to victory in November. Let's go!"" The political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus, CBCPAC, came out in support of Harris, as did as the head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Nanette Barragán of California.  ""The Congressional Black Caucus PAC joins President Biden in fully supporting Kamala Harris as our party's nominee,"" said CBCPAC chairman Rep. Gregory Meeks and caucus chairman Rep. Steven Horsford in a statement. ""She has been instrumental in delivering the accomplishments of the last 3.5 years and has led on lowering maternal mortality rates, protecting reproductive freedoms, and ensuring economic opportunities for all. She will do an excellent job as president of the United States."" Harris also got a public statement of support from actor and Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who had been a prominent Biden supporter but wrote an op-ed in The New York Times earlier in July urging Mr. Biden to end his campaign. Harris said that she plans to ""earn and win"" the Democratic presidential nomination in a statement released shortly after Mr. Biden's announcement.  ""I am honored to have the president's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,"" she said in the statement. ""Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party — and unite our nation — to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda."" While most major Democratic figures announced their endorsements of Harris within the first few days of her campaign, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a former rival in the 2020 primaries, spoke to Harris after Mr. Biden decided not to run but stopped short of endorsing her. Sanders told CBS News' Robert Costa that he believed Harris would be the nominee but he wanted to make sure she focuses on the working class.  ""What I want to see — because I want her to win — is to speak to the needs of people who have been forgotten for so many years,"" Sanders said. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is a major Democratic donor, also held off on endorsing. On Monday, he wrote that choosing a candidate is ""too important to rush, because the election is too important to lose."" ""Democrats now have a chance for a fresh new start, and while some elected leaders and party officials make their endorsements, there are still four weeks before the party's more than 4,000 delegates convene in Chicago,"" Bloomberg posted on social media. ""That is more than enough time for the party to take the pulse of voters, especially in battleground states, to determine who is best positioned to win in November and lead the country over the next four years.""

"Harris campaign claims it raised $150 million in July, tripling Trump’s total ","Trump Vs. Harris Fundraising Race: Harris Raises $540 Million Since Biden Dropped Out, Campaign Says  Vice President Kamala Harris’ entrance into the presidential election last month has blown up her fundraising race with former President Donald Trump, with the combined Biden and Harris campaigns raising more than four times as much as Trump in July and erasing the ex-president’s cash advantage—and Democrats say pro-Harris groups have raised over $500 million since Joe Biden left the race. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 19 in Chicago. The Biden—now Harris—campaign committee raised $516.8 million and Trump’s campaign committee raised $268.5 million in total between January 2023 and July 31, 2024, the most recent date for which Federal Election Commission filings are available. Harris also ended July with far more cash on hand than Trump—with $219.7 million to Trump’s $151.3 million—erasing a previous cash advantage the Trump campaign had at the end of June, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. The Harris campaign raised $204.5 million in July alone, while the Trump campaign raised $47.5 million, shaking up what was previously a more evenly-matched cash race (Biden and Trump had raised $284.1 million and $217.2 million in total as of the end of June, respectively) as Harris entered the race on July 21 and quickly posted huge fundraising numbers, with her campaign reporting $81 million in donations in the first 24 hours of her campaign. The fundraising surge reportedly continued into August: On Aug. 25, the campaign said Harris For President and allied groups had raised a combined $540 million since Biden dropped out, including some $82 million during the Democratic National Convention (those fundraising totals won’t be verified until official August data is released next month). Harris announcing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential nominee has also fueled fundraising, with the campaign reporting it raised $36 million in the 24 hours after the running mate was announced. Biden’s campaign committee was renamed for Harris when he dropped out and endorsed her, and though Trump has challenged that with the FEC, his challenge isn’t expected to impact the election. Many top donors also bankroll independent political groups like super PACs, which aren’t beholden to the FEC’s $6,600-per-person limit for direct campaign donations—which is where Trump still holds an advantage, at least for now. FEC filings through Aug. 21 show super PACs have spent approximately $64.5 million supporting Harris since the beginning of July, while PACs have spent approximately $38.9 million supporting Trump during that same period. The top 10 super PACs supporting Trump have collectively raised approximately $305.6 million since the beginning of the year, however, compared with $199.2 million raised by the top 10 PACs supporting Harris—though she may be able to narrow that gap in the weeks ahead.

Harris’ fundraising surge after she first announced her campaign surpassed the Trump campaign’s biggest donation bumps. The Trump campaign reported raising $52.8 million in the 24 hours after he was convicted on 34 felony charges in Manhattan in May, which led to the WinRed platform for small GOP donations temporarily crashing from the traffic. That was soon surpassed by the $81 million Harris raised in the first 24 hours of her campaign. PROMOTED We won’t know for sure how the two candidates’ fundraising matches up as of August until September 20. That’s when the campaigns will submit their FEC filings for how much they raised this month. Democrats are also outraising Republicans at the party level, with FEC filings through July showing the Democratic National Committee has raised $316.8 million, while the Republican National Committee has raised $290.7 million. That comes even as Republicans very slightly outraised the Democratic Party last month, taking in $30.94 million and Democrats $30.9 million. Democrats still had more cash going into August, however, holding $65.8 million to Republicans’ $30.9 million and erasing the GOP’s previous cash advantage they held at the end of June. The Biden—now Harris—campaign has historically spent its cash earlier than Trump, reporting through June that it’s spent $189.7 million, versus $92.1 million by the Trump campaign. That trend has remained the case now that Harris has entered the race, with the Harris campaign spending $80.7 million last month to Trump’s $24.3 million. The Biden and Harris campaigns have now spent $329.5 million in total this election cycle, versus $117.2 million by Trump. There are signs that the ex-president’s campaign is ramping up its spending as Harris has narrowed the polling gap between the two sides, however, making a $12 million ad buy for advertisements in battleground states through mid-August that Axios reported was believed to be Trump’s biggest ad buy since the primary election. Exclusive Invitation: Save up to 60% on a Forbes Membership    Billionaires have broken out their checkbooks for both candidates. Trump’s biggest donor is billionaire heir Timothy Mellon, who’s given an eye-popping $115 million to support the ex-president, including a new $50 million donation to Trump’s Make America Great Again super PAC in July. Trump’s other top billionaire supporters include Linda McMahon, wife of wrestling mogul Vince McMahon; energy executive Kelcy Warren; ABC Supply founder Diane Hendricks; oil billionaire Timothy Dunn and well-known conservative donors Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein. Tesla founder Elon Musk has also backed Trump through the newly formed America PAC, but he has denied reports saying he would donate $45 million per month to the super PAC. After Biden attracted billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Harris has already got the backing of a number of wealthy benefactors herself, including Hoffman, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg and philanthropist Melinda French Gates. More than 100 venture capitalists signed a letter on July 31 backing Harris’ candidacy and pledging to vote for her, which included such billionaires as entrepreneur Mark Cuban, investor Vinod Khosla and Lowercase Capital founder Chris Sacca. In addition to helping his campaign, Trump’s donors have also helped to finance his personal legal bills through his leadership PAC Save America, which has been used to pay his legal fees as cases against him have piled up. Trump’s campaign initially skimmed money from small-money donors for his legal fund, siphoning 10% of every dollar raised through his website for Save America. That ended when Trump joined forces with the RNC in March, but the ex-president is now soliciting help from bigger donors who give to his Trump 47 Joint Fundraising Committee. Donations to that committee first go to the Trump campaign—with a maximum contribution of $6,600 to his campaign and recount efforts—and up to $5,000 then goes to Save America. It’s only after that maximum has been reached that any money left over will go to the RNC and state parties. Harris entered the presidential race on July 21, as Biden announced he was leaving the race and endorsed the vice president minutes later. Her candidacy has reignited the presidential race as Biden faced growing questions about his mental fitness and polling showed Trump pulling ahead, with the VP’s enormous fundraising haul reflecting a broader enthusiasm about Harris on the left that’s also included an explosion of social media memes and thousands mobilizing for her campaign. Harris’ fundraising hauls come as Biden had long maintained a fundraising lead over Trump throughout the campaign. That narrowed more in recent months as Republicans have ended their primary and coalesced around the ex-president, Trump first outraising Biden in April as he joined forces with the RNC and as his criminal trial was underway.

"""Supreme Court expands Voting Rights Act’s reach for redistricting cases in the North""","Ongoing Voting Rights Act Redistricting Litigation After SCOTUS Ruling in Allen v. Milligan            There are at least 38 pending lawsuits around the country where voters of color are challenging maps that will be immediately impacted by the Court’s decision. In one of the most important decisions of the term, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s finding that Alabama diluted the electoral power of Black voters in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act when it redrew the state’s seven congressional districts in 2021. The 5–4 decision clears the way for the map to be redrawn in time for the 2024 election to create a second Black congressional district.  Allen v. Milligan, as the case is known, is a welcome departure from the Court’s tendency in recent decades to scale back or even wholly eliminate voting rights protections. Rather than further pare back the Voting Rights Act as many feared, the Milligan decision forcefully rejected Alabama’s attempt to have the Court radically rewrite or strike down a critical voting protection for communities of color. Instead, it reaffirmed the legal framework that has guided courts in Section 2 cases for almost 40 years.  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has long played an indispensable role in protecting against discrimination because it provides voters of color a tool to fight back against systemic exclusion from voting and effective representation. Instead of relying on federal enforcement by the Department of Justice, it creates an opportunity for minority communities to tell their own stories in court and challenge policies that limit their access to the ballot and legislative decision-making power. Section 2’s guarantees apply nationwide and ensure a baseline of fairness at all levels of government — congressional, state legislative, county commission, city council, school board, and judicial districts and all other electoral systems must operate to provide all voters an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of choice.  Since the Supreme Court adopted it in 1986, Section 2’s framework has helped communities of color pry the door open to political power. After the 1990 census, for example, five Southern states drew congressional maps that enabled Black and Latino communities to elect their preferred candidates for the first time. Yet in many ways, the impact on representation for communities of color at the local level has been even more profound. As the Milligan decision affirmed, lawmakers cannot enact electoral policies, including new voting districts, that limit the chances of electoral success for minority voters when compared to other voters. Section 2’s standard focuses on contexts where white voters systematically oppose candidates preferred by minority voters and where the district lines advantage the larger white voting bloc and effectively lock out minority voters. Plaintiffs must also prove that it is possible to draw alternative district lines that avoid such outcomes. In other words, Section 2 looks at the role that race plays within the politics of a particular region and whether districting choices in combination with such voting patterns have the effect of limiting political opportunities when viable alternatives are available.  But this is not the end of the inquiry: a successful Section 2 claim must also demonstrate that other circumstances intersect with the race dynamics in elections, such as the history of discrimination and ongoing social, economic, and political disparities, as Congress intended. All of these factors are inherently localized and fact-intensive. Proving a Section 2 case is by no means an easy task, especially, as the Milligan opinion noted, at the congressional and state legislative levels. But discrimination against voters of color persists across the country, in part driven by lawmakers emboldened by the weakening of safeguards. As a result, voters of color continue turning to the Voting Rights Act for relief. Currently, there are at least 38 pending Section 2 cases across 12 states, as detailed by the map below:   While many of these claims are in Southern states with long histories of voting rights abuses, including Alabama, Georgia, and Texas, communities are also seeking relief in states such as Kansas, Nebraska, and Washington. The groups invoking Section 2 protections are as varied as the geographies covered by their lawsuits. Of the tracked cases, 18 have been brought by Black voters, 5 by Latino voters, 3 by American Indian voters, and 10 on behalf of multiracial coalitions (many of which include Asian voters). The following chart breaks down where lawsuits are pending on behalf of various minority communities:  These 36 cases run the gamut in terms of the types of districts and election systems at issue. The table below sorts the states with active Section 2 litigation by the level of government being challenged:  See a full list of the active Section 2 cases and links to the plaintiffs’ complaints in the appendix below. Across these states and localities, voters of color are using Section 2 to lay out the relevant circumstances that limit their ability to have a seat at the policymaking table. Looking at some of the lawsuits filed by plaintiffs, the allegations demonstrate the political inequality faced by many voters and the indispensable role that Section 2 plays in contesting discriminatory maps. In Milligan v. Allen, Black voters in Alabama’s Black Belt turned to Section 2 to challenge the congressional map that divided the region among four congressional districts, footnote1_uZV6EcQDsIcr 1  ignoring the request of Black constituents to be kept together in two districts. Rather than respond to these calls, the legislature created three majority-white seats in the Black Belt where the Black share of the eligible voting population was 30 percent or less and one district where that population was 55 percent. Though this configuration resembled the old districts, the state’s demographics changed, as reflected in the 2020 census. And the racial dynamics in elections and significant disparities between the white and Black populations remained constant — a recipe for running afoul of the Voting Rights Act. Sure enough, plaintiffs demonstrated that 85 percent or more of white voters in the Black Belt categorically oppose Black-supported candidates. This means that in the three districts where Black voters are outnumbered, white voters effectively control elections, no matter how many Black citizens turn out to vote or how hard they work to build a winning cross-racial coalition. Plaintiffs also submitted alternative district maps that demonstrated that Alabama’s district configuration was a deliberate choice and not necessitated by other redistricting considerations. Finally, Black voters showed compelling evidence of lingering socioeconomic disparities in the Black Belt that hinder opportunities to participate in the political process: extreme poverty and disparities in education and health outcomes, among other factors. Taken together, these facts paint a grim picture of political inequality and a lack of response from elected officials — exactly the kinds of harms that Section 2 is designed to remedy. In Palmer v. Hobbs, Latino voters in Washington challenged the configuration of state legislative districts in the Yakima area under Section 2. Specifically, plaintiffs challenged a district that is majority Latino that they allege does not provide Latino voters an opportunity to elect candidates of choice because of differences in voter turnout, stark levels of racially polarized voting, and enduring discrimination and disparities between Latino and white communities. The suit underscores that Section 2 cannot be applied mechanically and that district maps must be assessed under existing conditions.   The Yakima Valley in Central Washington is a heavily agricultural region with a significant and quickly growing Latino population. The 2020 census showed that Yakima, Benton, and Franklin Counties, which make up the Yakima Valley, are now majority Latino. This is also a region with a long history of discrimination against Latino residents. Voting patterns are sharply divided on racial lines, and campaigns often feature overt and subtle hostility toward Latino candidates and voters. The Yakima Valley has also given rise to multiple Voting Rights Act cases in recent decades. In 2004, the Department of Justice successfully forced Yakima County to provide Spanish-language voting materials as required by federal law. And in the last 10 years, Latino voters filed two successful Section 2 suits to challenge how the cities of Yakima and Pasco elected their city councils.   Even with this recent record of problematic conditions in the region, the Washington Redistricting Commission ignored the call from advocates to draw a legislative district that would provide Latino voters a meaningful electoral opportunity. Instead, they drew a district whose citizen voting age population is 50.02 percent Latino, a bare majority that plaintiffs alleged would never elect Latino voters’ candidate of choice given significant disparities in political participation. Plaintiffs also point to other district configuration options available to the map drawers that could have drawn a district that did not effectively shut out Latino voters from being able to send representatives from Central Washington to the legislature.   Plaintiffs recently finished trial in this case and now await a ruling. The suit’s strong factual record should serve as a reminder to states and localities that quickly growing communities of color that have borne effects of discrimination and disparities can invoke Section 2 as demographics and on-the-ground electoral conditions demand.   In Petteway v. Galveston County, a group of Black and Latino voters from Texas’s Galveston County, near Houston, challenged a recently adopted county commission district map that dismantled a district that had previously given minority voters an opportunity to elect preferred candidates. The case squarely underscores how the Court’s loosening of voting rights safeguards has emboldened local tendencies toward discriminatory behavior and forced impacted communities to use Section 2 for relief.   Galveston County had been subject to preclearance under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act before the U.S. Supreme Court gutted that provision in the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision. Under the preclearance regime, the county had to submit any changes to its district map and other election rules to the U.S. Department of Justice or a federal court in Washington, DC, before the proposed changes could take effect. In the 2011 redistricting cycle, the Department of Justice used Section 5 to block Galveston County’s proposed commissioner map for limiting political opportunities for Black and Latino voters. This enforcement sent Galveston County back to the drawing board and produced a commission district where Black and Latino voters could elect their preferred candidates.   Fast-forwarding to 2021 redistricting, Galveston County’s commissioners dismantled the one district where Latino and Black voters combined to form a politically cohesive and effective majority, despite growth among Black and Latino populations. The new map disperses Black and Latino voters across all four commissioner seats where white voters constitute a majority. Plaintiffs believe that white voters across the county categorically oppose candidates favored by Black and Latino voters. They also point to ongoing disparities and a long and well-documented history of discrimination, including school segregation and disparities in funding recovery after a devastating hurricane, to make the case that Galveston County has violated Section 2.   This case is currently scheduled to go to trial in August 2023, when plaintiffs will have an opportunity to prove their case.   In Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska v. Thurston County, American Indian voters and the Winnebago and Omaha Tribes of Nebraska filed a Section 2 lawsuit for the third time in 45 years to challenge how Thurston County in Nebraska drew its board of supervisor districts. Like the Galveston County case, this lawsuit speaks to the brazenness of government officials at a time when voting rights protections have been scaled back.   To support their claim, plaintiffs point to Thurston County’s growing American Indian population, which now makes up a majority of eligible voters, and the decision to adopt a map where only three of seven districts give American Indian voters an opportunity to elect their preferred candidates. The Thurston County Board of Supervisors ignored the repeated requests of tribal leaders and American Indian residents to configure districts in ways that would provide for an additional electoral opportunity. Considering the consistent opposition of white voters to the preferences of American Indians in Thurston County and a long history of discrimination and ongoing socioeconomic disparities in employment, income, education, and access to health care, plaintiffs believe the adopted district plan violates Section 2.   Plaintiffs also point out that the U.S. Department of Justice had to bring a Section 2 suit against Thurston County in the 1970s to ensure that American Indian voters had an equal opportunity to elect preferred candidates. That suit challenged the at-large election system that discriminated against American Indian voters and resulted in the county adopting the seven-member district election system for electing the county’s governing body, which is still in effect today. However, private plaintiffs had to file a second suit in the 1990s to make sure that the district system could not be used to limit American Indian voters to two districts after the county’s demographics changed.   Yet again, tribal leaders and American Indian voters are forced to go to court to secure relief from discriminatory districting. Like in the 1990s, they allege that the county’s map fails to reflect the demographic changes, which will result in impermissible underrepresentation.   The highlighted suits and others speak to the continued importance that Section 2 plays in giving voters of color a voice to challenge district maps and the systems that deny equal electoral opportunities. In most of the pending cases, plaintiffs have yet to prove the facts that they allege, so it is too early to assess how these claims will fare before the courts. But even the existence of these suits suggests that many communities of color across the country contend with significant barriers to political participation and are actively seeking redress. Seeing which suits will ultimately succeed will require some patience. The timeline for each dispute differs from case to case. Some were put on hold in anticipation of the Milligan decision or were filed recently and are still in preliminary stages. Others, like the claim in Washington State, have just finished trial. The Milligan Alabama case and the claims challenging congressional districts in Georgia and Louisiana are perhaps on the strongest footing to deliver results ahead of the 2024 election — there, trial courts have already applied the Section 2 standards to the underlying facts and found that plaintiffs are likely to succeed. No matter their procedural posture, all 36 active cases now have the benefit of the U.S. Supreme Court’s guidance that reaffirms the congressional intent of the Voting Rights Act and the judicial analytical framework that has supported 40 years of antidiscrimination enforcement.

"""Uncertain move: Naidu govt considers erasing Jagan portraits from border stones, identity cards""","Not cast in stone: Naidu govt mulls over removing Jagan images from boundary markers, passbooks  During the recently concluded Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, the state Land Titling Act became a flashpoint between the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), with the former claiming that the system before the Land Tilling Act came into effect led to land encroachment under the previous regime and the TDP accusing the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led party of using the Act to grab land and property without the proper documents. After the N Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP alliance came to power, the new state government fulfilled its poll promise and repealed the Land Titling Act on July 24. Now, the Naidu government is contemplating removing Jagan Mohan Reddy’s photographs from the land boundary marker stones that were fixed during land surveys and from lakhs of land ownership passbooks issued as part of the Act. Naidu told the Assembly this week that the government would reissue the pattadar passbooks with only the official state seal. “The Jagan government wasted Rs 15 crore for printing his photos on the passbooks. The state government, as promised during the electioneering and as per the demand of the people, has decided to issue passbooks with the official seal. Officers have already submitted a copy of the passbook carrying the official seal,” said the CM. However, the TDP government is at a loss over what to do with approximately 77 lakh boundary stones with Jagan’s photo carved on them that revenue officials had planted. After the TDP stormed back to power, many farmers and landowners ripped out the stones, mostly because they disputed the land markings. The TDP’s Revenue Minister Anagani Satya Prasad claimed over 80% of land and property owners were unhappy with the YSRCP surveys and had initiated litigation. “We will be holding ‘gram sabhas’ in over 7,000 villages to ascertain if the land had been marked properly or not, and in consultations with the villagers, will conduct a resurvey if necessary and mark the boundaries accordingly,” he added. TDP ministers also alleged the Jagan government spent over Rs 600 crore to procure the boundary stones and carve the former CM’s image on them. “Though the Centre has never mentioned the issue of laying stones in the directions for the survey, Jagan prepared granite stones only for carving his pictures,” Satya Prasad said. Officials said that the exercise to re-issue land title passbooks without Jagan’s photograph, and the removal of the boundary stones with Jagan’s carving might cost up to Rs 15 crore. “The lakhs of granite stones that will be removed will be used for other purposes,” an official said. YSRCP spokesperson and former minister Ambati Rambabu accused the TDP and Naidu of levelling false allegations. “The land survey was done very scientifically and involved technology that ensured very precise marking of lands. The TDP had originally supported the YSRCP’s land survey but made a U-turn and opposed it. Even now, they are backtracking from their opposition by saying that they will conduct a re-survey, which means it will be a continuation of what the YSRCP government started,” he said. In October 2020, after the NITI Aayog, the Centre’s policy think tank, recommended the implementation of the Land Titling Act in all states, Andhra Pradesh became one of the first states to conduct land surveys to implement it. As per the now-repealed Act, all land and immovable property must be compulsorily registered with government agencies that will then issue permanent titles for them. The Act also provided a new system for speedy property dispute resolution by establishing tribunals. After the Act was rolled out, several property owners raised objections to the method of surveying lands using drones and geotagging, which resulted in discrepancies and disputes. During the election campaign, Naidu and ally JanaSena Party chief K Pawan Kalyan alleged that the YSRCP wanted to usurp land under the Act. In his public meetings, Naidu said the process of land surveys was full of discrepancies and that the people involved were not technically qualified to conduct such surveys.

"""Yogi's Govt Bill Faces Backlash from Senior UP BJP Leaders, Causing Political Turmoil""","Decode Politics: How a Yogi govt Bill ran into a wall raised by senior UP BJP leaders  In another attempt to project a united front in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP ensured that both its Deputy Chief Ministers in the state were present alongside CM Yogi Adityanath at the Legislature Party meeting convened before the start of the Monsoon Session of the Assembly this week. Days later, that front is again showing cracks. First, the Adityanath government’s Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilization for Public Purposes) Bill ran into objections from the BJP’s own ranks in the Assembly, with City West, Prayagraj, MLA and former minister Sidharth Nath Singh and Prayagraj MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai expressing apprehensions over the legislation. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna even intervened while Bajpai was speaking to appeal: “Aap samajh nahi rahe ho. Pahle padh toh lo (You do not understand the Bill. First, go through it carefully).” BJP ally NISHAD Party’s Anil Tripathi then joined Singh and Bajpai in expressing his misgivings. Then, a day after the Bill cleared the Assembly, the Legislative Council sent it to a Select Committee for further scrutiny. The demand was first made by UP BJP chief and MLC Bhupendra Chaudhary, and supported by Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, who has launched a covert rebellion against Adityanath. While Adityanath in his capacity as CM is the Leader of the BJP in the Assembly, Maurya is the leader of the BJP in the Council. The BJP and allies enjoy a clear majority in both the Houses, which means that it is rare for a Bill to be sent to a Select Committee, that too on a demand made from the Treasury Benches. Nazul land is land originally acquired during the colonial period for specific purposes such as public utilities, administrative functions or for the settlement of displaced individuals. Over time, this land has been used or leased for various public and private purposes. As per the proposed Bill, Nazul land in the state will now be reserved and used exclusively for public purposes. Any court proceedings or applications requesting the transfer of ownership of Nazul land to private individuals or institutions will be cancelled and automatically rejected. In case payments have been made in anticipation of such ownership changes, the amounts are to be refunded. The government could choose to extend the leases of current leaseholders of Nazul land, provided they are in good standing, regularly paying rent, and have not violated lease terms. While BJP leaders as well as the Opposition say they have raised objections to the Bill in “public interest”, the legislation in fact replaces an ordinance that has been in implementation since March this year. The ordinance did not see any significant opposition when it was passed by the Adityanath Cabinet. On Thursday, when Chaudhary proposed that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee, even Opposition members were initially caught off-guard, not knowing how to respond. Even as the latter neither backed nor opposed Chaudhary’s proposal, other BJP leaders expressed their support for Chaudhary, with Maurya indicating it by raising his hand. The other Deputy CM, Brajesh Pathak, was seated next to Maurya in his capacity as minister. He could not vote on the proposal as he is a member of the Assembly and not the Council, but as soon as the decision was taken to send the Bill to the Select Committee, Pathak and Maurya were seen shaking hands. While the Bill saw a discussion in the Assembly on July 31, before it was passed by a voice vote, there was no discussion on it in the Upper House on August 1 before it was sent to the Select Committee. In the Assembly, noting that “governments work in continuation”, Sidharth Nath Singh suggested that those who have been residing on such land for ages and near the end of their lease should be given the opportunity to get an extension. He also suggested that with previous governments alternatively allowing freehold of the land or stopping it, those who continued to pay their instalments after freehold should also be considered. The Indian Express spoke to some members of the Legislative Council, where the Bill saw no discussion. They admitted they had not read the Bill, but added that they knew it would be recommended for Select Committee appraisal as “the public is against the provisions of the Bill”. They could not say what these provisions were. A BJP MLC said: “When the organisational head makes a proposal, we have to follow. He (Chaudhary) is not just a member of the Council but also the head of the state organisation. Even the Leader of our House and Deputy CM Keshav ji supported it. Many people have been approaching us against the provisions as it would displace poor people who have been residing on Nuzul lands for generations… The new law would have given the government the power to take it back at will.” Asked why they did not object when the ordinance was moved, the BJP MLC said he “did not know about that”. “We had to support sending it to the Select Committee, and we did.” About the surprisingly vociferous intervention by BJP MLA Harshvardhan Bajpai on the matter, Prayagraj Mahanagar BJP president Rajendra Mishra said: “Harshvardhan ji is a two-term MLA and always speaks his mind and raises his voice for the people.” He added: “Harshavardhan ji only speaks and works according to the policy and agenda of the party and government.” Bajpai is the grandson of Rajendra Kumar Bajpai, a veteran Congress leader and former Union minister who was seen as close to Indira Gandhi. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav Friday demanded the permanent withdrawal of the “inhuman” Nazul Bill. Taking a swipe at Adityanath in a post on X, Akhilesh said: “The Nazul land issue is entirely a decision to uproot homes because a bulldozer cannot run over every house… What will the BJP gain by demolishing settled homes? Will the BJP render people homeless for the benefit of land mafias?” On Thursday, soon after the Bill was sent to a Select Committee, Akhilesh said the BJP government wanted the law for “the personal benefit” of some people. “There are many such lands in Gorakhpur which some people want to grab to expand their sphere of influence… It is hoped that the Chief Minister will take suo motu cognisance and will not let any such plan succeed, especially in Gorakhpur,” he wrote on X. Gorakhpur is Adityanath’s political turf.

Photo Credit: ANI Amid finalising of candidates for the coming elections to the 90-member Haryana Assembly, the Congress on Tuesday announced that it is talking to the Aam Admi Party (AAP) for an alliance in the State to ensure that votes against the BJP do not get divided. AAP sources claimed that they have demanded 10 Assembly seats while the Congress has offered seven seats so far. But the Congress leaders were guarded about the progress of talks. “The talks with Aam Aadmi Party regarding alliance is in a very preliminary stage. We are exploring it. If there is any further development in the next 2-3 days, we will let you know,” All India Congress Committee in-charge for Haryana Deepak Babaria told reporters. However, AAP sources told The Hindu that two rounds of meetings have taken place between Congress General Secretary (Organisation) K.C. Venugopal and Rajya Sabha member and AAP leader Raghav Chadha and another round is expected soon. The talks are said to have started after Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi pushed for an alliance to consolidate votes against the BJP. The two parties had an alliance for the recent Lok Sabha elections. However, Haryana Congress leaders, including former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, had ruled out an alliance. In a recent interview to The Hindu, Mr. Hooda had asserted that the Congress was “capable of defeating the BJP in Haryana” However, the alliance talks come at a time when the central election committee (CEC) is finalising the names of the Congress candidates. On Monday, the CEC had cleared 34 candidates, including 22 incumbent MLAs. By Tuesday, the CEC is said to have cleared over 66 seats, said a source. However, sources said the top election panel is yet to take a call on fielding senior leaders like Lok Sabha member Kumari Selja and Rajya Sabha member Randeep Surjewala. Both the leaders, known to be rivals of Mr. Hooda. have made public statements recently about their interest to return to State politics. Sources indicated that all the three leaders are likely to have a separate meeting on Thursday. The party is also yet to announce its decision to field wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia in the elections. Asked if their names have been put on hold for review, Mr. Babaria said, “No, their names are not there in that list of names.

"""Uddhav Thackeray denies BJP's 'power jihad' claims; praises Amit Shah's leadership""","Amit Shah political heir of Ahmad Shah Abdali, BJP doing ‘power jihad’: Uddhav Thackeray  Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of engaging in “power jihad” by destabilising political parties to remain in power. Thackeray was speaking in Pune as a part of the party’s meet ahead of the crucial assembly polls likely to be held in October this year. Responding to Union minister Amit Shah’s remark labelling him as the head of the “Aurangzeb Fan Club”, Thackeray claimed that Shah is a “political heir” of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the Afghan ruler who defeated the Marathas in the battle of Panipat. Earlier on July 21, Shah during his Pune visit had attacked the Sena (UBT) chief, saying, “Uddhav Thackeray is the leader of Aurangzeb Fan Club.” Read more: Kerala CM counters Amit Shah's 'early warnings' claim on Wayanad landslides: ‘Red alert issued only after…’ Thackeray accused the BJP, a former ally, of orchestrating splits in political parties, notably the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Referring to a letter from the former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Balasaheb Deoras to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Thackeray pointed out that Deoras emphasised no hatred toward Muslims or non-Hindus and upheld secularism as a valued Hindu trait. Thackeray questioned whether this form of Hindutva was unacceptable to Shah. He claimed that the people of Maharashtra delivered a strong message to Shah during the recent Lok Sabha elections, stating that after campaigning and facing voter backlash, Shah returned to his leaders to assess the political damage. He told his party workers in Pune that, according to the BJP, aligning with Muslims after explaining their version of Hindutva equates to being part of the “Aurangzeb Fan Club” and accused the saffron party of engaging in “power jihad”. The Sena leader claimed that the Eknath Shinde government’s “Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin” scheme was an attempt to bribe voters with freebies. Thackeray also mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demand for accountability from the Congress for its 70-year governance, highlighting that the new parliament building had structural issues within a year of its construction. He urged Modi to address the mismanagement of his government.

Mr. Pawar had said he would quit politics if the reports about his Delhi visit before the NCP forged an alliance with the BJP in 2023 were proven, and if not, those raising such allegations should quit politics. ""I never made allegations against anyone. I believe in constructive politics and policy-making.

"""Nazul Land Bill: Why this uncontroversial legislation is causing a political calm in UP with BJP, NDA allies and opposition in harmony""","U.P.: Differences arise in NDA over Nazul Bill; allies describe it against public ‘sentiments’    Published - August 02, 2024 09:18 pm IST - Lucknow Samajwadi Party workers stage a protest against the passing of the Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilization for Public Purposes) Bill, 2024 in the State Assembly, in Prayagraj on August 1, 2024   Photo Credit: ANI After the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha passed the U.P. Nazul Property Bill that prevents the conversion of Nazul land into private freehold, differences are out on open over the Bill within the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in U.P. with Apna Dal leader and Union Minister Anupriya Patel and Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (NISHAD) chief Sanjay Nishad objecting to the passage of the Bill calling it ‘unnecessary’ and ‘against the public sentiments’.  “The Bill related to Nazul land has been sent to the Select Committee of the Legislative Council for discussion. I firmly believe that the Nazul land Bill, which has been brought without extensive discussion, is not only unnecessary but also against the public sentiments. The Uttar Pradesh government should immediately withdraw this Bill and strict action should be taken against those officials who have misled in this matter,” Ms. Patel wrote on X (formerly Twitter), hours after the State Assembly cleared the Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilisation for Public Purposes) Bill, 2024, amidst strong opposition not only by the Opposition but also from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs and allies. However, the Bill was sent to select committee in the Legislative Council soon after it was passed. Mr. Nishad, a U.P. Minister and another BJP ally said that if we (government) destroy or displace anyone who is living in these lands for 70-80 years, then these poor people will displace the ruling regime in 2027 election. “The government should take vacant land, but should accommodate the poor living in Nazul land, if we destroy or displace them, they will displace us (the NDA) in 2027,” Mr. Nishad said.  Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilisation for Public Purposes) Bill, 2024, aims to regulate Nazul land, which are government-owned but not directly managed as State property. The Bill aims to prevent its conversion into private ownership. In the Bill, court proceedings or applications for transferring Nazul land to private individuals or institutions will be cancelled and rejected, ensuring these lands remain under government control. The Bill allows the State government to extend lease for current leaseholders in good standing, who regularly pay rent and comply with lease terms.  The evolution of Nazul land happened during pre-independence with Britishers taking away land of defeated kings. After Independence, the British vacated these lands. But the original owner lacked documentation to prove prior ownership, leading to these lands marked as Nazul land which are owned by State governments. In these large tracts of land majorly in cities, poor people are living generally on lease, along with hospitals, government offices established in such lands.

You can read our report on Iran heading to a presidential run-off that is scheduled to take place on Friday. We will be bringing you all the latest news and analyses in the lead-up to the run-off, as well as live coverage on the day. Thanks for joining us. As we prepare to end our live coverage, here is a recap of what happened today: The second round of voting pitting Pezeshkian and Jalili is scheduled to take place on Friday. The candidate with the highest number of votes is declared winner and the next president of Iran. This is only the second time since the 1979 revolution that a presidential election has gone to a second round. Three other conservative candidates have backed Jalili but Pezeshkian’s biggest opponent may still be another record low turnout. Finishing third in the first round, Speaker of the Parliament Ghalibaf had a disappointing showing in the election. In a lengthy statement, he called on his supporters to back Jalili on Friday. “The path is not finished yet and despite personally respecting Dr Pezeshkian, due to my concerns about some of the people around him, I am calling on all revolutionary forces and my backers to help prevent the return to power of the movement that caused an important part of our economic and political problems today,” he wrote. Ghalibaf added that he was glad he took part in the election even though “political sensibility” signalled that he must remain in his position as parliament speaker. He claimed his candidacy “provided an opportunity for the revolutionary movement in the second round of the election”. Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani and government official Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, who dropped out of the race shortly before election day, have backed hardliner Jalili after conservative parliament speaker Ghalibaf was dealt a massive blow in the polls and got eliminated in the first round. The Zakani team announced that all the mayor’s campaigning centres across the country “will work with full capability and capacity for the victory of the candidate of the revolution front”. Ghazizadeh said in a post on X that it is the “duty” of all who care about the country to vote for Jalili as the representative of the conservatives in the election, and asked Ghalibaf to step in with support as well. Hamid Reza Gholamzadeh, an Iranian foreign policy expert, has attributed the historic low voter turnout to what he said was the reformist camp’s failure to activate the sector of the electorate which usually votes for it and drives participation up. Despite the endorsement of heavyweight reformists such as former President Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, candidate Masoud Pezeshkian “failed to awaken that part of the society which is usually when we have a turnout above 50 percent – that usually comes from the reformist side,” Gholamzadeh told Al Jazeera. “And I would interpret that as people saying they want change,” Gholamzadeh added. Questions now loom on whether the July 5 run-off between the contrasting camps will prompt more people to vote. The last time the country went to a run-off was in 2005. At the time, the second round of voting saw a lower turnout compared to the first one, which paved the way for staunch hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to win the election. Iran’s nuclear programme and the “nuclear deal” have been prominent in the run-up to the election, so let’s review the basics. Signed in 2015 between Iran and China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action set limits on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for lifting UN Security Council sanctions on Iran. It looked like Iranian isolation was ending, but US President Donald Trump withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, imposing harsh sanctions on Iran’s economy – they remain in place. The JCPOA has been in limbo for years, with Iran becoming a nuclear threshold state in response to the sanctions and to sabotage attacks blamed on Israel. There are hardliners on all sides who want the deal to die. The state of the economy is one of the key issue on voters’ minds as they head out to cast their ballots. Successive governments have failed to tackle currency depreciation and inflation, blaming the economic crisis on international sanctions imposed over the country’s nuclear development programme. Candidates are promising to address the financial challenges, but many in Iran say they’ve heard those promises before. “I am not going to vote because presidents can’t do anything,” Afsaneh Nourani, a Tehran resident, said. “They don’t have the authority to do anything for people and life is very expensive.” Iran’s economy relies on crude exports, which have increased due to the easing of sanctions under the Biden administration. But the increase in spending by the government is not being felt on the streets or on the currency. The rial is already trading at nearly 600,000 to the dollar, a 15-fold increase since 2018. “Compared to last year, the prices have increased by 150 percent. I earn in local currency, but prices are based on dollars,” said Akbar Sedigh, also a resident of the capital. The two candidates who head to the run-off scheduled for Friday can start campaigning again soon. Iran’s electoral law says candidates can begin election activities for the second round from the time the definitive results of the first round are confirmed. The Interior Ministry has sent the results to the Guardian Council, with the 12-member constitutional body expected to review and confirm soon. Similar to the first round, campaigning can continue up to 24 hours before the start of run-off voting. Sanctions and corruption are among the factors contributing to inflation in Iran, says Mohammad Reza Farzanegan, professor of economics of the Middle East at Germany’s Philipps-Universitat Marburg. “We see that sanctions contributed to an excess inflation rate of about 8 percentage points per year. So in the absence of sanctions, this inflation rate could be much lower,” Farzanegan told Al Jazeera. He added that sanctions push people into engaging in illicit trade, such as smuggling or seeking intermediaries for financial transactions, pushing prices up. “When you cannot directly pay other countries, you need intermediaries and that result is higher costs of trade, production and consumer prices.”    Follow Al Jazeera English:","""Has the conservative leader in Iran been officially confirmed as the winner of the recent election by the country's election commission?""",False,False,True

"""Iran's conservative candidate Mohammad Reza Peshehkani wins presidential runoff vote amidst controversy""","Reformist Pezeshkian elected president of Iran in runoff vote, defeating hard-liner Jalili        Jon Gambrell, Associated Press Amir Vahdat, Associated Press Leave your feedback DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian won Iran’s runoff presidential election Saturday, besting hard-liner Saeed Jalili by promising to reach out to the West and ease enforcement on the country’s mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic. READ MORE: Iranians vote in presidential runoff between hard-liner Jalili and reformist Pezeshkian Pezeshkian promised no radical changes to Iran’s Shiite theocracy in his campaign and long has held Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the final arbiter of all matters of state in the country. But even Pezeshkian’s modest aims will be challenged by an Iranian government still largely held by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, and Western fears over Tehran enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels. A vote count offered by authorities put Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jalili’s 13.5 million in Friday’s election. Overall, Iran’s Interior Ministry said 30 million people voted in an election held without internationally recognized monitors. Supporters of Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and longtime lawmaker, entered the streets of Tehran and other cities before dawn to celebrate as his lead grew over Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator. “Dear people of Iran, the elections are over and this is just the beginning of our cooperation,” Pezeshkian wrote on the social platform X, still banned in Iran. “The difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy and trust. I extend my hand to you and I swear on my honor that I will not leave you alone on this path. Do not leave me alone.” Pezeshkian’s win still sees Iran at a delicate moment, with tensions high in the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war, Iran’s advancing nuclear program, and a looming election in the United States that could put any chance of a detente between Tehran and Washington at risk. Pezeshkian’s victory also wasn’t a rout of Jalili, meaning he’ll have to carefully navigate Iran’s internal politics as the doctor has never held a sensitive, high-level security post. The first round of voting June 28 saw the lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iranian officials have long pointed to turnout as a sign of support for the country’s Shiite theocracy, which has been under strain after years of sanctions crushing Iran’s economy, mass demonstrations and intense crackdowns on all dissent. Government officials up to Khameni, the supreme leader, predicted higher turnout as voting got underway, with state television airing images of modest lines at some polling centers. However, online videos purported to show some polls empty while a survey of several dozen sites in Tehran saw light traffic and a heavy security presence on the streets. In remarks Saturday, Khamenei praised the turnout despite what he alleged was a boycott campaign “orchestrated by the enemies of the Iranian nation to induce despair and a feeling of hopelessness.” “I would like to recommend Dr. Pezeshkian, the elected president, put his trust in God, the Compassionate, and set his vision on high, bright horizons,” Khamenei added. Authorities put turnout in Friday’s vote at 49.6 percent, still historically low for an Iranian presidential election. They counted 607,575 voided votes — which often are a sign of protest by those who feel obligated to cast a ballot but reject both candidates. “I don’t expect anything from him — I am happy that the vote put the brake on hard-liners,” said bank employee Fatemeh Babaei, who voted for Pezeshkian. “I hope Pezeshkian can return administration to a way in which all people can feel there is a tomorrow.” Taher Khalili, a Kurdish-origin Iranian who runs a small tailor shop in Tehran, offered another reason to be hopeful while handing out candy to passersby. “In the end, someone from my hometown and the west of Iran came to power,” Khalili said. “I hope he will make economy better for small businesses.” Pezeshkian, who speaks Azeri, Farsi and Kurdish, campaigned on outreach to Iran’s many ethnicities. He represents the first president from western Iran in decades — something people hope will aid the county as those in the western part are considered more tolerant because of the ethnic and religious diversity in their area. The election came amid heightened regional tensions. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups armed by Tehran — such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels — are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks. Iran is also enriching uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so. And while Khamenei remains the final decision-maker on matters of state, whichever man ends up winning the presidency could bend the country’s foreign policy toward either confrontation or collaboration with the West. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, which has reached a detente with Iran, sent his congratulations to Pezeshkian that stressed his “keenness to develop and deepen the relations that bring our two countries and peoples together.” Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has relied on Iranian-made drones in his war on Ukraine, similarly congratulated Pezeshkian. There was no immediate response from the U.S. The campaign also repeatedly touched on what would happen if former President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, won the November election. Iran has held indirect talks with President Joe Biden’s administration, though there’s been no clear movement back toward constraining Tehran’s nuclear program for the lifting of economic sanctions. Though identifying with reformists and relative moderates within Iran’s theocracy during the campaign, Pezeshkian at the same time honored Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, on one occasion wearing its uniform to parliament. He repeatedly criticized the United States and praised the Guard for shooting down an American drone in 2019, saying it “delivered a strong punch in the mouth of the Americans and proved to them that our country will not surrender.” More than 61 million Iranians over the age of 18 were eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 and 30. Voting was to end at 6 p.m. but was extended until midnight to boost participation. The late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a May helicopter crash, was seen as a protégé of Khamenei and a potential successor as supreme leader. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.

"""Britain's Conservative party snatches a crushing election loss with a whopping 66% of the national vote""","1966 United Kingdom general election   Harold Wilson Labour Harold Wilson Labour The 1966 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 31 March 1966. The result was a landslide victory for the Labour Party led by incumbent Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Wilson decided to call a snap election since his government, elected a mere 17 months previously, in 1964, had an unworkably small majority of only four MPs. The Labour government was returned following this snap election with a much larger majority of 98 seats. This was the last British general election in which the voting age was 21; Wilson's government passed an amendment to the Representation of the People Act in 1969 to include eligibility to vote at age 18, which was in place for the next general election in 1970. This was the only election between 1945 and 1997 in which the Labour Party won a workable majority sustainable to last a full term. In the next seven general elections, the Labour Party would win a majority of seats only once (October 1974) and would lose five elections to the Conservatives. This election also noted the Labour Party achieving its third-highest vote-share (48%) and second largest total number of votes in history (the largest vote-share being the 49.7% achieved in the 1945 election). Prior to the 1966 general election, Labour had performed poorly in local elections in 1965, and lost a by-election, cutting their majority to just two. Shortly after the local elections, the leader of the Conservative Party Alec Douglas-Home was replaced by Edward Heath in the 1965 leadership election. Despite setbacks and a small majority, Labour believed it had an advantage due to the disorientation from the change of leadership at the Conservative Party, the improvement of economic conditions under its brief government, and a victory at the 1966 Kingston upon Hull North by-election.[1] The Conservatives had not had much time to prepare their campaign, although it was more professional than previously. There had been little time for Heath to become well known among the British public, having led the party for just eight months before the election. For the Liberal Party, money was an issue: two elections in the space of just two years had left the party in a tight financial position and had to field fewer candidates.[2] Labour ran its campaign with the slogan ""You know Labour government works"" and avoided commenting on controversial issues such as European integration, trade unions, and nationalisation.[1] The election night was broadcast live on the BBC, was presented by Cliff Michelmore, Ian Trethowan, Robin Day, Robert McKenzie and David Butler. The election was replayed on the BBC Parliament channel on the 40th anniversary of the event,[3] and again in 2016 to mark the 50th anniversary of the election.[4] Although the BBC's telecast was in black and white, a couple of colour television cameras were placed in the BBC election studio at Television Centre to allow CBS's Charles Collingwood and NBC's David Brinkley to file live reports from that studio by satellite and in colour for their respective networks' evening news programmes (which were transmitted at 11:30 pm British time, 6:30 pm Eastern Standard Time). The Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, announced on 28 February that Parliament would be dissolved on 10 March, for an election to be held on 31 March. The key dates were as follows: The Labour Party performed very well in the election and expanded its previously slim majority against the Conservative opposition to 97 seats, accomplishing a net gain of 48 seats. It won 364 seats from 48 per cent of the vote, against 253 seats from 41.4 per cent for the Conservatives and 12 seats from 8 per cent for the Liberals. A major reason for the Labour victory was the revitalization of the party's working-class support in the 1960s. It captured its highest support yet from manual laborers at 69 per cent, as well as its best performance for non-manual laborers since 1945. The government also appealed to both the right wing of the party with its cabinet dominated by junior ministers of the Attlee ministry as well as the left wing by the presence of officials such as Prime Minister Wilson, Richard Crossman, Barbara Castle, and Frank Cousins.[1] Although the party would go on to win more seats under Tony Blair (1997, 2001) and Keir Starmer (2024), Labour have never since matched the 48% of the popular vote they won in 1966.

"""India-Bangladesh trade faces stability as Modi's resignation shakes up commerce""","Narendra Modi   Chief Ministership Premiership (Timeline) Budgets           Controversies  Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: [ˈnəɾendɾə dɑmodəɾˈdɑs ˈmodiː] ⓘ; born 17 September 1950)[a] is an Indian politician serving as the current Prime Minister of India since 26 May 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress.[3] Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998.[b] In 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[c] and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.[12] A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[d] While his policies as chief minister were credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[e] In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and it reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[15][16] but the action had nationalist appeal.[17] Modi's party won the 2019 general election which followed.[18] In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,[19][20] and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs.[21][22][23] Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which, according to the World Health Organization's estimates, 4.7 million Indians died.[24][25] In the 2024 general election, Modi's party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament and formed a government leading the National Democratic Alliance coalition.[26][27] Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of democratic institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression.[28][29][f] As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings.[35][36][37] Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[g] Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of oil presser (Modh-Ghanchi) which is an Other Backward Class (OBC) category[44][45] in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (1923–2022).[46][a][47] Modi had infrequently worked as a child in his father's tea business on the Vadnagar railway station platform, according to Modi and his neighbours.[48][49][50] Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967; his teachers described him as an average student and a keen, gifted debater with an interest in theatre.[51] He preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[52][53] When Modi was eight years old, he was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, he met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, who inducted Modi as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.[54] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who in 1980 helped found the BJP's Gujarat unit.[55] As a teenager, he was enrolled in the National Cadet Corps.[56] In a custom traditional to Narendra Modi's caste, his family arranged a betrothal to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18.[57][58] Soon afterwards, he abandoned his wife,[59] and left home. The couple never divorced but the marriage was not in his public pronouncements for many decades.[58] In April 2014, shortly before the national election in which he gained power, Modi publicly affirmed he was married and that his spouse was Jashodaben.[60] A Modi biographer wrote that Modi kept the marriage a secret because he would not have been able to become a pracharak in the RSS, for which celibacy had once been a requirement.[61][62] Modi spent the following two years travelling across northern and north-eastern India.[63] In interviews, he has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. His stays at each ashram were brief because he lacked the required college education.[64] Vivekananda has had a large influence in Modi's life.[65] In mid 1968, Modi reached Belur Math but was turned away, after which he visited Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. He then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before returning to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968 to 1969. In either late 1969 or early 1970, he returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad,[66][67] where he lived with his uncle and worked in his uncle's canteen at Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[68] In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[69][70][71] Modi's first-known political activity as an adult was in 1971 when he joined a Jana Sangh Satyagraha in Delhi led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to enlist to fight in the Bangladesh Liberation War.[72][73] The Indira Gandhi-led central government prohibited open support for the Mukti Bahini; according to Modi, he was briefly held in Tihar Jail.[74][75][76] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Modi left his uncle's employment and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS,[77] working under Inamdar.[78] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest in New Delhi against the Indian government, for which he was arrested; because of this arrest, Inamdar decided to mentor Modi.[78] According to Modi, he was part of a Satyagraha that led to a political war.[75][h] In 1978, Modi received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in political science from the School of Open Learning[81] at the Delhi University.[61][82] In 1983, he received a Master of Arts (MA) degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class[83][84] as an external distance learning student.[85] There is a controversy surrounding the authenticity of his BA and MA degrees.[86][87][i] In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as ""the Emergency"", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[91][92] Modi was appointed general secretary of the ""Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti"", an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[93] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh.[94] He became involved in the printing of pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[95][96] He was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[97] During this period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In the Struggles of Gujarat), which describes events during the Emergency.[98][99] While in this role, Modi met trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political figures.[100] Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS's history of the Emergency. Shortly after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP. In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; according to biographers, Modi's planning was responsible for the win.[101][102] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role. Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[103] Modi rose within the party and was named a member of its National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise Advani's Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991–1992 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity).[51][104][105] Modi took a brief break from politics in 1992 to establish a school in Ahmedabad, and due to friction with Shankersinh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat.[105] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani; as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly election.[106][107] In November of that year, Modi was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[108] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha election.[51] Modi, who was on the selection committee for the 1998 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as central to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 election,[109] and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[110] In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing, and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[109][111][112] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement.[51] Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government. Modi declined an offer to become Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee he was ""going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all"". On 3 October 2001, Modi replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the upcoming December 2002 election.[113] On 7 October, Modi was sworn in[114] and he entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 after winning a by-election in Rajkot II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC.[115] On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[j][118] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[119][120] In a public statement, Modi said local Muslims were responsible for the incident.[9][119][121] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh (general strike) across the state.[122][123] Riots began during the bandh and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[119][122][123] The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[119][124] The state government later stated 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed during the riots;[120] independent sources put the death toll at over 2,000,[119][118][125] the vast majority of them Muslims.[118] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[126] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilation of women.[8][127] Scholars consider the Government of Gujarat to have been complicit in the riots,[9][128] and it has received much criticism for its handling of the situation;[129] some scholars explicitly blame Modi.[8][130][131] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets; these measures failed to prevent the violence from escalating.[122][123] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh despite such actions being illegal at the time.[9] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, which were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[132] Muslim victims of the riots were subjected to further discrimination when the state government announced their compensation would be half that offered to Hindu victims; this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[133] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[8][121][134] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom and others have called it an example of state terrorism.[135][136][137] According to Martha Nussbaum, ""There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law"".[8] Modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, he said, ""What is happening is a chain of action and reaction"".[8] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[138] In March 2008, the Supreme Court of India reopened several cases related to the riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[129][139][140] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri, the widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, in April 2009, the court also asked the SIT to investigate Modi's complicity in the killings.[139] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[139][141] In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, Ramachandran said Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[142][143] The Supreme Court sent the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013, the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding there was no evidence against Modi.[144] In 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition by Zakia Jafri in which she challenged the clean chit given to Modi in the riots by the SIT, and upheld previous rulings that no evidence against him was found.[145][146][147] Following the violence, calls for Modi to resign as chief minister were made from politicians within and outside the state, including leaders of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party—partners in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition—and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[148] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa but it was not accepted.[149] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[150] In the election, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[151] Modi made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[152][153][154][155] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among voters.[150] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride,[7][152] a strategy that led to the BJP winning 127 of the 182[151] seats—a two-thirds majority—in the state assembly.[7][152] He won Maninagar constituency, defeating Congress candidate Yatin Oza.[156] On 22 December 2002, Modi was sworn in for a second term.[157] During Modi's second term, the government's rhetoric shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.[111][7][152] He curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).[158] When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration, Modi ordered the BKS's eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[158][159] Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. He wrote a foreword to a 2014 textbook by Dinanath Batra, which made the unscientific claim that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[160][161] Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Indian general election, following which, Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[162][163] Western nations also raised questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims: the US State Department barred him from entering the United States in accordance with the recommendations of that country's Commission on International Religious Freedom,[164][165] the only person to be denied a US visa under this law.[164] The UK and the European Union (EU) refused to admit Modi because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[166] and the EU[167] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister in 2014, the US lifted its ban and invited him to Washington, D.C.[168][169] During the run-up to the 2007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election and the 2009 Indian general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[170] Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ""for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation"" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.[171] In 2007, Modi wrote Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, he said scavenging is a ""spiritual experience"" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.[172][173] The book was not circulated at that time because of the election code of conduct.[174] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Gujarat government authorised the deployment of 30 high-speed boats for coastal surveillance.[175] In July 2007, Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post.[176] The BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.[177] Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's campaigns in 2007 and 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections contained elements of Hindu nationalism. He attended only Hindu religious ceremonies and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign, Modi twice refused to wear skullcap gifted by Muslim leaders.[152] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[152] Modi's 2012 campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including Afzal Guru and the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the 2012 assembly election.[152] During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[152] While campaigning for the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies, allowing him to reach a large number of people,[150] something he repeated in the 2014 general election. Modi won the constituency of Maninagar, defeating Shweta Bhatt of the INC.[178] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure.[179] After his election as Prime Minister of India, Modi resigned as the Gujarat chief minister and as MLA for Maninagar. Anandiben Patel succeeded Modi as chief minister.[180] As chief minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, which is usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. Modi's policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in Gujarat. He established financial and technology parks in the state and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion (equivalent to ₹20 trillion or US$240 billion in 2023) were signed.[111] The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[181] Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[182] As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India.[181] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[183] led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 per cent from 2001 to 2007.[184] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project irrigated only 4–6% of the area intended.[181] In 2008, Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano car after popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Following Tata, several other companies relocated to Gujarat.[185] The Modi government finished the process of taking electricity to every village in Gujarat its predecessor had almost completed.[186] Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Early protests by farmers ended when those who benefitted found their electricity supply had stabilised[181] but, according to an assessment study, corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[187] A contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development during Modi's tenure as chief minister.[188] The state's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate averaged 10% during his tenure, a rate similar to those of other highly industrialised states, and above that of India as a whole.[185] Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office; some scholars have stated growth did not much accelerate during his tenure.[189] Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's ""ease of doing business"" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[190] In 2013, a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights, and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states, ranked Gujarat first among Indian states for ""economic freedom"".[185][191] In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[7] Tax breaks and land for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states. Modi's policies of making Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones in which labour laws were greatly weakened.[152] Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in India with respect to rates of poverty, and 21st in education. Nearly 45 per cent of children under five were underweight and 23 per cent were undernourished, putting the state in the ""alarming"" category on the India State Hunger Index.[192][193] A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found Gujarat under Modi had a poor record in immunisation of children.[194] From 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[133] It showed a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[133] The quality of education in government schools in Gujarat ranked below that of many Indian states.[133] The state government's social policies generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[133] Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas and those from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013, the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index.[11] Under Modi, the state government spent less than the national average on education and healthcare.[133] During its raids in 2013 and 2014, the CBI seized some diaries from two big Indian companies, Sahara Group and Aditya Birla Group. These diaries contained references of alleged payments made to leaders belonging to as many as 18 political parties including BJP, Congress, JDU, BJD etc.[195][196] Among these were some entries mentioning ""Gujarat CM"" and ""Ahmadabad Modiji"".[197][198][196] Citing these entries, on 21 December 2016, the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that Modi received cash bribes worth ₹65 crore (US$7.8 million) from Sahara Group and Aditya Birla Group when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.[199][200] In November 2016, advocate Prashant Bhushan had filed a plea in the Supreme Court of India asking for investigation of the alleged bribe payments made to some senior public servants including Modi.[201][202] A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Arun Kumar Mishra dismissed the plea in January 2017 stating that the evidence provided was insufficient.[203][204] Later on, Justice Mishra was criticised by a section of advocates and activists for siding with the Modi government in multiple judgements during his tenure at the Supreme Court.[205][206] The Wire questioned the manner in which the Supreme Court buried the Sahara-Birla diaries' investigation.[207] In September 2013, Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[208][209] Several BJP leaders,[210] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani who cited concern with leaders who were ""concerned with their personal agendas"", expressed opposition to Modi's candidature.[211] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's 2009 general election campaign.[212][213] Several people who voted for the BJP stated they would have voted for another party if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate.[208][214][215] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.[210][216] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.[188] During the campaign, Modi focused on corruption scandals under the previous Congress government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.[210] He projected himself as a person who could bring about ""development"" without focusing on specific policies.[210] His message found support among young and middle-class people. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.[213] Prior to the election, Modi's media image had centred around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots but during the campaign, the BJP focused on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development.[213] The BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders who publicly opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose and Ram Manohar Lohia.[161] Hindutva remained a part of the campaign; BJP leaders used Hindutva-based rhetoric in several states.[217][210][214][40] Communal tensions were played upon, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Northeast India.[217] A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP's election manifesto.[40] The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.[193] Modi's campaign blitz cost around ₹50 billion (US$600 million)[188] and the BJP received extensive financial support from corporate donors.[218] In addition to more-conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media[188][210] and addressed more than 1,000 rallies via hologram appearances.[40] The BJP won 31 per cent of the vote,[39] and more-than-doubled its number of seats in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984.[213][214] Voter dissatisfaction with the Congress and with regional parties in North India, and support from the RSS were reasons for the BJP's success.[214][210] In states such as Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, and its Muslim vote increased to 10 per cent. The BJP performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.[214] The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties towards the right-wing.[40][188][214][219][220] Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.[221] Modi was a candidate for the Lok Sabha constituencies Varanasi and Vadodara.[222] He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi by 371,784 votes and Madhusudan Mistry of the Congress in Vadodara by 570,128 votes.[223] India's president appointed Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, Prime Minister of India.[224][225] To comply with the law prohibiting MPs from representing more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.[226] On 13 October 2018, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2019 general election.[227] The BJP's chief campaigner was its president Amit Shah. Modi launched the party's Main Bhi Chowkidar (""I too am a watchman"") campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC's campaign slogan Chowkidar Chor Hai (""The watchman is a thief"").[228] In 2018, the Telugu Desam Party split from the NDA over the campaign for special status for Andhra Pradesh.[229] Amit Shah launched the BJP's election campaign on 8 April 2019. In the campaign, the opposition targeted Modi on allegations of corruption over the Rafale deal with the Government of France, highlighting the controversy surrounding the deal.[230] Modi's campaign focused on defence and national security, especially after the Pulwama attack and the retaliatory Balakot airstrike, which was counted as an achievement of his administration.[18][231] Other topics in the campaign were development and good foreign relations in the first premiership.[232] Modi contested the Lok Sabha election as a candidate for Varanasi; he won the seat by a margin of 479,505 votes, defeating Shalini Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP), who stood as a candidate for the SP-BSP alliance.[233][234] Modi was unanimously appointed prime minister for a second time by the National Democratic Alliance[235] after the alliance won the election for the second time with 353 seats in the Lok Sabha; the BJP alone won 303 seats.[236][237] In November 2023, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2024 general election.[238] The BJP's chief campaigner was its home minister Amit Shah and President J. P. Nadda.[239] Modi launched the party's ""Modi Ki Guarantee"" (""Modi's assurance"")[240] campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC's guarantees campaigns, that led to the party's enormous victories in the assembly elections of Karnataka and Telangana.[241] Modi contested the Lok Sabha election as a candidate for Varanasi for the third consecutive time; he won the seat by a margin of 152,513 votes, defeating Ajay Rai of the Indian National Congress (INC), who contested as a candidate for the SP-INC alliance. His victory margin was the second lowest ever (in percentage points) for a sitting Prime Minister in India.[242][243] The National Democratic Alliance secured a total of 292 seats, 20 seats ahead of simple majority, and the BJP solely winning 240 seats.[244] Modi thanked the voters for reposing faith in his government for the 3rd consecutive time.[245] After the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a landslide in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014, becoming the first Indian PM to be born after the country's independence from the British Empire in 1947.[246] Modi's second term as PM began in 2019 following the NDA's 2019 Lok Sabha election win. On 6 December 2020, he became the fourth-longest-serving Prime Minister of India and the longest-serving non-Congress prime minister.[247] Modi's first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power.[161][248] Modi, who initially lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[249] His administration enacted a bill to increase its control over the appointment of judges and reducing that of the judiciary.[39] In December 2014, he abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog),[250][251] concentrating the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the PM.[249][250][251][252][253] The Planning Commission had in previous years been criticised for creating inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling its role of improving social welfare but since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.[251][254] In its first year of administration, the Modi government launched investigations through the Intelligence Bureau into numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the grounds these organisations were slowing economic growth. The investigations were criticised as a witch hunt. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres, and environmental nonprofit organisation Sierra Club and Avaaz were among the groups that were investigated.[161][252] Cases of sedition and terrorism laws were filed against individuals who criticised the government.[161][255] This led to discontent within the BJP about his style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.[161][249] Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments in the previous 64 years.[256][257][258] Modi launched the Digital India programme with the goal of ensuring government services are available electronically, build infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boost manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promote digital literacy.[259][260] In 2019, a law to reserve 10 per cent of educational admission and government jobs for economically disadvantaged individuals was passed.[261][262] In 2016, Modi's administration launched the Ujjwala scheme to provide free liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to rural households. The scheme led to an additional 24% of Indian households having access to LPG in 2019 as compared to 2014.[263] In 2022, the government eliminated LPG subsidies for all citizens except those covered by the Ujjwala program.[264] Since May 2023, ethnic tensions between some groups have resulted in violent clashes in Manipur. After 1 month of the violence, nearly 100 were killed and more than 36,000 people were displaced.[265] Modi has been criticised for his lack of reaction towards the violence.[266] The activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi's appointment as prime minister, sometimes with the government's support.[267][268] These activities included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the supposed Islamic practice of ""Love Jihad"" (an Islamophobic[274] conspiracy theory)[269]: 226–227 [275]: 1–2 [276] and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right-wing organisation Hindu Mahasabha.[277][278] Government officials, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.[217] Links between the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) grew stronger under Modi. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP's electoral campaigns while the Modi administration appointed RSS-affiliated individuals to prominent government positions.[279] In 2014, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, became the chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).[40] Historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the BJP, questioned Rao's credentials as a historian and stated the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.[40][280][281] During its first term, the Modi administration appointed other RSS members to lead universities and research institutions, and recruitment of faculty members favouring the RSS increased. According to scholars Nandini Sundar and Kiran Bhatty, many of these appointees did not possess the qualifications for their positions.[282] The Modi administration also made numerous changes in government-approved history textbooks that de-emphasised the role of Jawaharlal Nehru and glorified that of Modi while also portraying Indian society as harmonious, and without conflict and inequity.[282][283] In 2019, the Modi administration passed a citizenship law that provides a route to Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians,[284][285] but does not grant eligibility to Muslims.[286][287][288] This was first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law; it attracted global criticism and prompted widespread protests that were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[282][288][289] Counter-demonstrations against the protests developed into the 2020 Delhi riots, caused chiefly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims.[290][291] Fifty-three people were killed in the protests, two-thirds of whom were Muslim.[292][293][294][295][296] On 5 August 2020, Modi visited Ayodhya after the Supreme Court in 2019 ordered contested land in Ayodhya to be handed to a trust to build a Hindu temple and ordered the government to give alternative 5 acres (2.0 ha) of land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.[297] Modi became the first PM to visit temples at Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi.[298] Soon after Modi returned to power in 2019, he took three actions the RSS had long called for.[282] The practice of Triple Talaq was made illegal and became a punishable act from 1 August 2019.[299][300][301] The administration repealed Article 370 of the Indian constitution that granted autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, and also abrogated its statehood, reorganising it into the union territories Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.[282][302] The region was placed under a lockdown and internet services were suspended and were not completely restored until February 2021.[303] Thousands of people, including hundreds of political leaders, were detained.[304][305][306][307] The Supreme Court of India did not hear constitutional challenges to the reorganisation or the Citizenship Amendment Act. According to Bhatty and Sundar, this is an example of the subversion of the Supreme Court and other major institutions, which were filled with appointees favouring the BJP.[282] During his campaign for 2024 Indian general election, Modi referred to Muslims as infiltrators with many children who would take India’s wealth, if his political opponents gained power.[308][309] In a later interview, Modi said that regardless of the social class, there are more children in neighbourhoods plagued by poverty. He said he made no mention of Muslim or Hindu in his campaign speech.[310][311] However, factcheckers have refuted this claim of Modi and found numerous instances across his election campaign where he communally targeted the Muslims.[312][313] The Modi government's economic policies focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, and were based on a neoliberal framework.[252][314] Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including defence and railways.[252][315][316] Other proposed reforms included making the forming of unions more difficult for workers, and making recruitment and dismissal easier for employers;[314] some of these proposals were abandoned after protests.[317] The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions—including one affiliated with the BJP—struck.[314] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (Indian Workers Union), a constituent of the Sangh Parivar (Family of the RSS), stated the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers.[252] The funds dedicated to poverty-reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly reduced by Modi's administration.[161] The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6 per cent of GDP during the previous Congress government to 12.6 per cent during Modi's first year in office, and spending on health and family welfare declined by 15 per cent.[252] The government lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold and jewellery.[252] In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices.[318] During Modi's first term, his government reduced spending on education as share of the budget: over five years, education spending dropped from 0.7 per cent of GDP to 0.5 per cent.[319][320][321] The percentage of the budget spent on children's nutrition, education, health, and associated programmes was almost halved between 2014 and 2022.[322] Capital expenditure on transport infrastructure significantly rose, increasing from less than 0.4 per cent of GDP in 2014 to 1.7 per cent in 2023.[323] In September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.[252][324] Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative but critics said it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market.[252] Modi's administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it.[325] The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in Parliament but was eventually allowed to lapse.[249] Modi's government passed the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence, subsuming around 17 taxes and became effective on 1 July 2017.[326] In his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money.[327] On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes with the intention of curbing corruption, black money, terrorism and the use of counterfeit currency.[328] The move led to severe cash shortages,[329][330][331] and a steep decline in the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50,[332] and sparked widespread protests throughout the country.[333] It is estimated 1.5 million jobs were lost and that one per cent of the country's GDP was wiped out.[334] Several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash.[335][336] In the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25 per cent and the number of digital transactions steeply increased.[337][338] Modi's administration has observed a decline in GDP growth and increasing joblessness compared to the previous administration under Manmohan Singh.[339] During the first eight years of Modi's premiership, India's GDP grew at an average rate of 5.5% per cent compared tho the rate of 7.03 per cent under the previous government.[340] Income inequality increased.[341] An internal government report said in 2017, unemployment increased to its highest level in 45 years. The loss of jobs was attributed to the 2016 banknote demonetisation, and the effects of the Goods and Services Tax.[342][343] GDP growth was 6.12 per cent in the 2018–19 financial year, with an inflation rate of 3.4 per cent.[344] In the year 2019–20, the GDP growth rate slowed to 4.18 per cent, while inflation increased to 4.7 per cent.[345] The Indian economy shrunk by 6.6 per cent during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–21, and was estimated to grow at 8.2 per cent the following financial year.[346] In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the central government's healthcare spending.[194] In January 2015, the Modi government launched its New Health Policy (NHP), which did not increase the government's spending on healthcare but emphasised the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including a reduction in child and maternal mortality rates.[347] The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices, received nearly 20 per cent less funding[348][349] in 2015 than in the previous year. The Modi administration reduced the healthcare budget by a further 15% in its second year.[350] The healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%; private insurance providers positively viewed the budget but public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers and said it represented a shift away from public health facilities.[351] The healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of ₹20 billion (US$240 million) for a government-funded health insurance program and a decrease in the budget of the National Health Mission.[352] Modi emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health.[347] On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (""Clean India"") campaign. The campaign's stated goals included the elimination of open defecation and manual scavenging within five years.[353][354] As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.[355][356][357] The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants,[358] and planned to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects faced allegations of corruption and severe difficulty in getting people to use the newly constructed toilets.[354][355][356] Sanitation cover in India increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 84.1% in May 2018 but use of the new sanitary facilities was lower than the government's targets.[359] In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated at least 180,000 diarrheal deaths in rural India were averted after the launch of the sanitation effort.[360] In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modi administration invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.[361][362] The same month, all commercial domestic and international flights were suspended.[363] Modi announced a 14-hour curfew on 22 March,[364] and followed with a three-week ""total lockdown"" two days later.[365][366] Restrictions were gradually lifted beginning in April, and were completely revoked in November 2020.[363][367][368] A second wave of the pandemic that began in March 2021 was significantly more devastating than the first; some parts of India experienced shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies.[369] In late April India reported over 400,000 cases in a 24-hour period, the first country to do so.[370] India began its vaccination programme in January 2021;[371][372] in January 2022, India announced it had administered about 1.7 billion doses of vaccines and that more than 720 million people were fully vaccinated.[373] In May 2022, the WHO estimated 4.7 million people had died of COVID-19 in India, mostly during the second wave in mid 2021—almost 10 times the Indian government's estimate. The Modi administration rejected the WHO's estimate.[24][25] Foreign policy played a small role in Modi's election campaign and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto.[374] Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding Congress government, focused on improving economic ties, security and regional relations.[374] Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of ""multi-alignment"".[374] The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially East Asia, with the use of slogans such as ""Make in India"" and ""Digital India"". The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel.[k] India's relationship with the United States improved after Narendra Modi became PM.[376] During the run-up to the general election, there was wide-ranging scepticism about future of the strategic bilateral relationship under Modi's premiership; in 2005, while Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi was denied a US visa during the presidency of George W. Bush for his poor human-rights record.[164][165] Sensing Modi's victory well before the election, US Ambassador to India Nancy Powell contacted Modi as part of greater rapprochement from the West. Following Modi's 2014 appointment as India's PM, President Obama congratulated him over the telephone and invited Modi to visit the US.[377] The Modi government enjoyed a positive relationship with the US during the presidencies of Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump.[378][379] During the first few months after his appointment as PM, Modi visited a number of countries in support of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN and G20 summits.[374] One of Modi's first visits as PM was to Nepal, during which he promised one billion US dollars in aid.[380] Modi also made several visits to the US;[381] this was described as an unexpected development because of the US's earlier denial of a US travel visa to Modi over his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. The visits were expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.[381] In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land-exchange deal with Bangladesh in the India–Bangladesh enclaves, which the government of Manmohan Singh had initiated.[249] Modi's administration brought renewed attention to India's ""Look East Policy"", which was instituted in 1991. The policy, which was renamed the ""Act East Policy"", involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia.[382] The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar through the Indian state of Manipur; this represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.[382] China–India relations rapidly deteriorated following the 2020 China–India skirmishes.[383] Modi pledged aid of $900 million to Afghanistan, which he visited twice and was honoured with Afghanistan's highest civilian honour in 2016.[384][385] In September 2022, Modi appeared to have developed a strong personal relationship with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.[386][387][388] India hosted the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit, during which the African Union joined the G20 as a permanent member.[389] In an interview on 26 August 2023, Prime Minister Modi expressed optimism about the G20 countries' evolving agenda under India's presidency, shifting toward a human-centric development approach that aligns with the concerns of the Global South, including addressing climate change, debt restructuring through the G20's Common Framework for Debt, and a strategy for regulation of global cryptocurrencies.[390][391][392] Modi's governement faced scrutiny in the lead-up to the G20 meeting as multiple news sources reported that Indian authorities demolished slum neighborhoods in New Delhi, displacing marginalized residents.[393][394][395] India's nominal military spending steadily increased under Modi.[396] During Modi's tenure, the military budget declined, both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation.[397][398] A substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs commentators wrote the budget was constraining Indian military modernisation.[397][399][398] Modi promised to be ""tough on Pakistan"" during his election campaign and repeatedly called Pakistan an exporter of terrorism.[400][401][402] On 29 September 2016, the Modi administration said Indian Army had conducted a surgical strike on terror launch pads in Azad Kashmir; the Indian media said up to 50 terrorists and Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike.[403][404][405] Pakistan denied any surgical strikes to have taken place.[406] Subsequent reports said India's statement about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated.[400][407][408] In February 2019, India carried out airstrikes against a supposed terrorist camp in Pakistan; no targets of significance were hit.[409][410] Further military skirmishes, including cross-border shelling and the loss of an Indian aircraft, occurred.[411][412][413] Eight months after the incident, the Modi administration admitted that six Indian military personnel had been killed by friendly fire.[414] In May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in aggressive skirmishes along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake, Ladakh, and the Tibet Autonomous Region and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes took place in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).[415] In 2020, skirmishes between the nations led to many border clashes, responses and reactions from both sides.[416] A series of talks between India and China were held, using military and diplomatic means for peace.[417] The first border clash reported in 2021 was on 20 January; this was referred to as a minor border clash in Sikkim.[418] Modi has been criticised for maintaining silence over ceding about 2,000 sq km land to China since June 2020.[419][420][421] In December 2021, Modi signed an agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin to extend military technical cooperation.[422] The Modi government bought the S-400 missile system, an anti-missile striking system, strengthening the relationship between the two nations.[423] India refused to condemn the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and stayed neutral.[422][424] The Indian government's Operation Ganga initiative sought to return Indians stranded in Ukraine during the war. More than 19,000 Indian nationals were evacuated,[425][426] including some from neighbouring countries.[427] While naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the Ministry of Environment and Forests the ""Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change"", and reduced its budget allocation by more than half in his administration's first budget.[428] The new ministry removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection, and others related to industrial activity.[252] The government also tried to reconstitute the National Board for Wildlife so it would no longer have representatives from NGOs but the Supreme Court of India blocked this move.[429] Other changes included a reduction of ministry oversight on small mining projects and ending the requirement for approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. Modi also lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in India's most-polluted areas.[429] The changes were welcomed by businesspeople but criticised by environmentalists.[430] Speaking with Assamese students in 2014, Modi downplayed climate change, saying, ""Climate has not changed. We have changed. Our habits have changed. Our habits have got spoiled. Due to that, we have destroyed our entire environment.""[431] Later in his administration, however, he has called for climate action,[432][433] especially with the proliferation of clean energy.[434][435] In 2015, Modi proposed the International Solar Alliance initiative to encourage investment in solar energy.[436] Holding developed countries responsible,[437] Modi and his government have said India has had a negligible historical role in climate change. At the COP26 conference, Modi announced India would target carbon neutrality by 2070 and expand its renewable energy capacity.[438] Indian environmentalists and economists applauded the decision, describing it as bold climate action.[439] India has become the only major economy to be on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals.[440] It has achieved 10 per cent of ethanol blending five months ahead of schedule.[441] Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.[f] According to one study, ""The BJP government incrementally but systemically attacked nearly all existing mechanisms that are in place to hold the political executive to account, either by ensuring that these mechanisms became subservient to the political executive or were captured by party loyalists"".[31][442] The Modi government has used state power to intimidate and stifle critics in the media and academia, undermining freedom of expression and alternative sources of information.[443][32] His administration has been criticised for using a democratic mandate to undermine democratic processes, including focusing on Hindu-nationalist priorities rather than economic development. Modi's second term as PM, in particular, saw the erosion of civil rights and press freedom.[444] Narendra Modi has received consistently high approval ratings during his premiership.[35] Modi is a vegetarian and teetotaller,[445][446] who has a frugal lifestyle, and is a workaholic and has been described as an introvert.[447] On 31 August 2012, he posted on Google Hangouts, becoming the first Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat.[448][449] Modi has been called a fashion icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, and for a suit with his name repeatedly embroidered in the pinstripes, which he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention, and criticism.[450][451][452] Scholars and biographers have described Modi's personality as energetic, eccentric, arrogant and charismatic.[39][453] The nomination of Modi for the prime-ministership drew attention to his reputation as ""one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians"".[188][454][455] During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader who would be able to take difficult decisions.[188][208][210][214][215] Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, an unusual tactic for the BJP and RSS.[210] Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and development.[456] Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.[10] Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government also continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[10][39][161][210] During his premiership, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of respondents rating him ""very favourably"" and 93% approving of his government.[457] Modi's approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% during his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani.[458] At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him ""very favourably"".[459][460] At the end of his third year in office, a further Pew Research poll showed Modi with an overall approval rating of 88%, his highest yet, with 69% of people polled rating him ""very favourably"".[461] A poll conducted by The Times of India in May 2017 showed 77% of respondents rated Modi as ""very good"" and ""good"".[462] In early 2017, a survey by Pew Research Center showed Modi to be the most popular figure in Indian politics.[463] In a weekly analysis by Morning Consult called the Global Leader Approval Rating Tracker, Modi had the highest net approval rating as of 22 December 2020 of all government leaders in the 13 countries being tracked.[464][465] Modi Kaka Ka Gaon (Modi uncle's town), a 2017 Indian Hindi-language drama film by Tushar Amrish Goel, is the first biopic about Modi. It stars Vikas Mahante in the titular role.[466] PM Narendra Modi, a 2019 Hindi-language biographical drama film by Omung Kumar, stars Vivek Oberoi in the titular role and covers Modi's rise to the premiership.[467] An Indian web series called Modi: Journey of a Common Man, which is based on the same premise, was released in May 2019 on the video streaming platform Eros Now with Ashish Sharma portraying Modi.[468] 7 RCR (7, Race Course Road), a 2014 Indian docudrama political television series which charts the political careers of prominent Indian politicians, covered Modi's rise to the PM's office in the episodes ""Story of Narendra Modi from 1950 to 2001"", ""Story of Narendra Modi in Controversial Years from 2001 to 2013"", ""Truth Behind Brand Modi"", ""Election Journey of Narendra Modi to 7 RCR"", and ""Masterplan of Narendra Modi's NDA Govt"", with Sangam Rai in the role of Modi.[469] India: The Modi Question, a 2023 BBC documentary, examines Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots and his record as Prime Minister of India. The Indian government banned the documentary, drawing widespread criticism.[470][471][472][473] Other portrayals of Modi include those by Rajit Kapur in the film Uri: The Surgical Strike (2019) and Vikram Gokhale in the web-television series Avrodh: The Siege Within (2020), both of which are based on the 2016 Uri attack and the subsequent Indian surgical strikes.[474][475] Gokhale reprised the role in the sequel Avrodh: The Siege Within 2 (2022), which is based on the 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation.[476] Pratap Singh played a character based on Modi in Chand Bujh Gaya (2005) which is set against the backdrop of the Gujarat riots.[477] Modi appeared in an episode of Discovery Channel's show Man vs. Wild with the host Bear Grylls in July 2019,[478][479] becoming the second world leader after Barack Obama to appear in the reality show.[480] In the show, Modi treks through jungles, and talks about nature and wildlife conservation with Grylls.[481] The episode was recorded in Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand, and was broadcast in India and 180 other countries.[482] Modi hosts Mann Ki Baat, a monthly radio programme on All India Radio, and has conducted the competition Pariksha Pe Charcha, and discussions for students and the issues they face in examinations.[483][484] In March 2012 and June 2014, Narendra Modi appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of Time Magazine, becoming one of the few Indian politicians to have done so.[485][486] In 2014, CNN-News18 (formally CNN-IBN) news network awarded Modi Indian of the Year.[487] In June 2015, Modi was featured on the cover of Time Magazine.[488] In 2014, 2015, 2017, 2020 and 2021, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.[489] Forbes Magazine ranked him the 15th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2014 and the 9th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2015, 2016 and 2018.[490] In 2015, Modi was ranked the 13th Most Influential Person in the World by Bloomberg Markets Magazine.[491] In 2021, Time called Modi the third ""pivotal leader"" of independent India after Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, who ""dominated the country's politics like no one since them"".[492][493] Modi was ranked fifth on Fortune Magazine's first annual list of the ""World's Greatest Leaders"" in 2015.[494][495] In 2017, Gallup International Association (GIA) conducted a poll and ranked Modi third-top leader of the world.[496][497] In 2016, a wax statue of Modi was unveiled at Madame Tussauds wax museum in London.[498][499] In 2015, Modi was named one of Time's ""30 Most Influential People on the Internet"" because he was the second-most-followed politician on Twitter and Facebook.[500] In 2018, he was the third-most-followed world leader on Twitter and the most-followed world leader on Instagram and Facebook.[501][502][503] In October 2018, Modi received United Nations' highest environmental award, the Champions of the Earth, for policy leadership by ""pioneering work in championing"" the International Solar Alliance and ""new areas of levels of cooperation on environmental action"".[504][505] Modi was conferred the 2018 Seoul Peace Prize.[506][507] Following his second oath of office ceremony as Prime Minister of India, a picture of Modi was displayed on the facade of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) building in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.[508] The Texas India Forum hosted a community event, Howdy Modi, in honour of Modi on 22 September 2019 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. The event was attended by over 50,000 people and several American politicians, including President Donald Trump, making it the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope.[509][510] At the event, Modi was presented with the Key to the City of Houston by Mayor Sylvester Turner.[511] The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Modi the Global Goalkeeper Award on 24 September 2019 in New York City, in recognition of the Swachh Bharat Mission and ""the progress India has made in providing safe sanitation under his leadership"".[512][513][514] In 2020, Modi was among eight world leaders who were awarded the parody Ig Nobel Prize in Medical Education ""for using the COVID-19 viral pandemic to teach the world that politicians can have a more immediate effect on life and death than scientists and doctors can"".[515] On 21 December 2020, US President Donald Trump awarded Modi the Legion of Merit for improving India–United States relations.[516][517][518][519] On 24 February 2021, Gujarat Cricket Association controversially renamed Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad—the largest cricket stadium in the world—Narendra Modi Stadium.[520] In 2024, during a visit to Russia, Modi was awarded the Order of St. Andrew, Russia's highest civilian award, for his effort in the development of the bilateral ties between India and Russia.[521] ^ = February 2002 by-poll election; and ♦ = December 2002 Assembly election. In 2008, Modi published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj, which contains profiles of RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (""Guru worthy of worship"").[529] According to The Economic Times, Modi's intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers, and to reassure RSS members he remained ideologically aligned with them. After becoming the Prime Minister he also authored a book called Exam Warriors, a guide for children to commendably face exams. Modi has written eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.[530] Modi has penned the lyrics of two Gujarati garba songs; Garbo, sung by Dhvani Bhanushali and composed by Tanishk Bagchi, and Maadi, sung by Divya Kumar and composed by Meet Bros.

"""Japan's Nikkei 225 Index Soars 12.4%, Its Biggest Rise Since October 1987""","Japan’s Nikkei 225 stock index plunges 12.4% as investors dump a wide range of shares   A monitor shows the Nikkei 225 stock index in Tokyo, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, indicating at one point, over 2,537 points of lowering. (Shohei Miyano/Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s Nikkei 225 stock index plunged more than 12% on Monday as investors worried that the U.S. economy may be in worse shape than had been expected and dumped a wide range of shares. The Nikkei index fell 4,451.28 points to 31,458.42. It dropped 5.8% on Friday and has now logged its worst two-day decline ever, dropping 18.2% in the last two trading sessions. At its lowest, the Nikkei plunged as much as 13.4% on Monday. Its biggest single-day rout was a drop of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on the day dubbed “Black Monday” in October 1987. It suffered an 11.4% drop in October 2008 during the global financial crisis and fell 10.6% in the aftermath of a massive earthquake and nuclear meltdowns in northeastern Japan in March 2011. Monday’s decline was the second largest percentage loss in a single day and the largest ever loss in terms of points. Share prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei index is now about 3.8% below the level it was at a year ago. The wave of selling hit all sorts of companies. Toyota Motor Corp.'s shares dropped 13.7% and Honda Motor Co. lost 17.8%. Computer chip maker Tokyo Electron dived 18.5% and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group plunged 17.8%. Analysts said another factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades, where investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return. Investors have been selling stocks to repay those loans as their costs have risen with a stronger yen and higher interest rates.  “The surge in financial market volatility was the result of a perfect storm of macro and market shocks at a time when risk assets were already overbought and overstretched,” BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said in a report. It said the Bank of Japan’s July 31 decision to raise its key interest rate “led to a sharp unwind of the yen carry trade, which added downside pressure on risk assets which were already selling off.” Before raising its benchmark rate last week to 0.25% from 0.1%, the Bank of Japan had kept the overnight call rate on its loans to banks near or below zero for years. The dollar gained against the yen and other currencies as the Federal Reserve raised its own benchmark rate to a two-decade high to stamp out inflation, and the weaker yen helped push costs higher in Japan, which depends heavily on imports of food, fuel and other necessities. In its update to Japan’s economic outlook, the central bank said it would “accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation,” a stance that now is being called into question. So is the decision of the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady at least until September. “The BOJ is arguably in a greater bind, struggling to credibly backtrack on hawkish guidance that has flown out of control, triggering an unintended Nikkei tailspin,” Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank said in an analysis. Calls to “keep calm and carry on” won’t fly, he said. “But to avoid self-reinforcing panic is perhaps the more critical thing for markets to avert a deeper sell-down.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
